is, roughly, an isomorphism of derived categories of (sheaves) on smooth

OB and Of stars and Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs). In this paper we report on
two ring nebulae around blue supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The
star Sk-69 279 is classified as O9f and is surrounded by a closed shell with a
diameter of 4.5 pc. Our echelle observations show an expansion velocity of 14
km/s and a high [N II]6583A/H alpha ratio. This line ratio suggests nitrogen
abundance enhancement consistent with those seen in ejectas from LBVs. Thus the
ring nebula around Sk-69 279 is a circumstellar bubble. The star Sk-69 271, a
B2 supergiant, is surrounded by an H alpha arc resembling an half shell.
Echelle observations show a large expanding shell with the arc being part of
the approaching surface. The expansion velocity is about 24 km/s and the [N
II]6583A/H alpha is not much higher than that of the background emission. The
lack of nitrogen abundance anomaly suggests that the expanding shell is an
interstellar bubble with a dynamic age of 2 10^5 yr.

parameterized by an effective polytropic exponent gama-eff. In the limit of

e^{M^2}, and the production of vorticity by the nonlinear terms appears to be
negligible. In the presence of self-gravity, we suggest that turbulence can
produce bound structures for gama-eff < 2(1-1/n), where 'n' is the typical
dimensionality of the turbulent compressions. We show, by means of numerical
simulations, that, for sufficiently small gama-eff, small-scale turbulent
density fluctuations eventually collapse even though the medium is globally
stable. This result is preserved in the presence of a magnetic field for
supercritical mass-to-flux ratios.

data on $w(\theta)$ in six narrow magnitude is used, after correcting to
possible evolutionary effects, to constrain the spectrum of galaxy clustering
on scales $10h^{-1}Mpc < r < 50-100h^{-1}Mpc$. Fitting power spectra of CDM
models to the data at all depths requires $\Omega h=0.2$ if the primordial
index $n=1$ and $\Omega h=0.3$ if the spectrum is tilted with $n=0.7$. Then we
compare the peculiar velocity field predicted by the APM spectrum of galaxy
(light) distribution with the actual velocity data. The two fields are
consistent and the comparison suggests that the bias factor is scale
independent with $\Omega^{0.6}/b\simeq$(0.2-0.3). The next dataset used comes
from the cluster correlation data. We calculate in detail the amplification of
the cluster correlation function due to gravitational clustering and use the
data on both the slope of the cluster correlation function and its
amplitude-richness dependence. Cluster masses are normalized using the Coma
cluster. We find that CDM models are hard to reconcile with all the three

data on the amplitude-richness dependence can be used directly to obtain the
spectrum of the pregalactic density field. Applying the method to the data, we
recover the density field on scales between 5 and 25$h^{-1}$Mpc whose slope is
in good agreement with the APM data on the same scales. Requiring the two
amplitudes to be the same, fixes the value of $\Omega$ to be 0.3 in agreement

  147-176",,,"cs.AI",,"  We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks,
which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic
expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple
evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a
number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the
answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest.
It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms
for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using
clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a
Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the
inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation
algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a
standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended
value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to
utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed
framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different
software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation
algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes:
simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex
optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning
and computation-caching.

  cores","AmsTeX, 12 pages",,,,"dg-ga math.DG",,"  A fundamental object in a hyperbolic 3-manifold M is its convex core C(M),
defined as the smallest closed non-empty convex subset of M. We investigate the
way the geometry of the boundary S of C(M) varies as we vary the hyperbolic
metric of M. Thurston observed that the intrinsic metric of S is hyperbolic,
and that its bending is described by a measured geodesic lamination. We show
that, as the hyperbolic metric of the 3--manifold M varies differentiably, the
hyperbolic metric of the surface S varies in a C^1, but usually not C^2,
manner. Differentiability properties for the bending measured lamination are
conceptually less simple, because the space ML(S) of measured geodesic
laminations on S has no natural differentiable structure. However, ML(S) is a
piecewise linear manifold, and we also show that the bending measured geodesic
lamination varies differentiably in a piecewise linear sense.
  The two results are proved simultaneously, mixing the differentiable and
piecewise linear contexts. In particular, the 'corners' of the piecewise linear
structure of ML(S) account for the fact that the metric of S is not a C^2
function of the metric of M. A by-product of the proof is a similar
differentiablity property for Thurston's parametrization of complex projective
structures on a surface by hyperbolic metrics and measured laminations.

not constant any more, but we showed in an earlier paper that the variation of

oscillating inflaton field. In this paper we describe the perturbative approach
to reheating, and then concentrate on effects beyond the perturbation theory.
They are related to the stage of parametric resonance called preheating. It may
occur in an expanding universe if the initial amplitude of oscillations of the
inflaton field is large enough. We investigate a simple model of a massive
inflaton field coupled to another scalar field X. Parametric resonance in this
model is very broad. It occurs in a very unusual stochastic manner, which is
different from the parametric resonance in the case when the expansion of the
universe is neglected. Quantum fields interacting with the oscillating inflaton
field experience a series of kicks which occur with phases uncorrelated to each
other. We call this process stochastic resonance. We develop the theory of
preheating taking into account the expansion of the universe and backreaction
of produced particles, including the effects of rescattering. The process of
preheating can be divided into several distinct stages. At the first stage the
backreaction of created particles is not important. At the second stage
backreaction increases the frequency of oscillations of the inflaton field,
which makes the process even more efficient than before. Then the effects
related to scattering of X-particles terminate the resonance. We calculate the
density of X-particles and their quantum fluctuations with all backreaction
effects taken into account. This allows us to find the range of masses and
coupling constants for which one has efficient preheating. In particular, under
certain conditions this process may produce particles with a mass much greater
than the mass of the inflaton field.

charginos and neutralinos may dominantly decay to $\tau$-leptons or $b$-quarks.

SUSY may be detectable via new signals involving $\tau$'s or $b$'s in the final
state.

transition in the minimal supersymmetric standard model: the traditional
effective potential (EP) approach, and the more recently advocated procedure of
dimensional reduction (DR). The latter tries to avoid the infrared
instabilities of the former by matching the full theory to an effective theory
that has been studied on the lattice. We point out a limitation of DR that
caused a large apparent disagreement with the effective potential results in
our previous work. We also incorporate wave function renormalization into the
EP, which is shown to decrease the strength of the phase transition. In the
regions of parameter space where both methods are expected to be valid, they
give similar results, except that the EP is significantly more restrictive than
DR for the range of baryogenesis-allowed values of $\tan\beta$, $m_h$, the
critical temperature, and the up-squark mass parameter $m_U$. In contrast, the
DR results are consistent with $2\lsim\tan\beta\lsim 4$, $m_h<80$ GeV, and
$m_U$ sufficiently large to have universality of the squark soft-breaking
masses at the GUT scale, in a small region of parameter space. We suggest that
the differences between DR and EP are due to higher-order perturbative
corrections rather than infrared effects.

Yang-Mills theory. As applied to the case of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory,
realized in terms of N=2 superfields, the latter result leads to the remarkable
conclusion that the one-loop effective action of the theory does not contain

"math/9704201",,"Kang-Tae Kim, Mario Landucci, Andrea F. Spiro","Factorization of proper holomorphic mappings through Thullen Domains",,,,,"math.CV",,"  In this article, we consider a bounded pseudoconvex domain in ${\bf C}^2$
satifying:
  (a) it admits a proper holomorphic mapping $f$ onto the unit ball $B^2$, and
  (b) it is simply connected and has a real analytic boundary.
  According to [Barletta-Bedford, Indiana U. Math. J, 39(1985), 315-338], the
strong pseudconvexity of $B^2$ alone yields that such a domain is ""weakly
spherical"" at the boundary points that are at the same time a smooth point of
the branch locus $Z_{df} = \{\det(J_{\bf C} f) = 0\}$. (Notice that
[Diederich-Fornaess, Math. Ann., 282 (1988), 681-700] implies that $f$ as well
as $Z_{df}$ extends holomorphically across the boundaries.)
  Our main contribution in this paper is that we have discovered a stronger
rigidity (both local and global) in case the target domain is the unit ball.
The main results are:
  THEOREM (""Local Rigidity""): Let $(M,o)$ be a real analytic normalized weakly
spherical pointed CR hypersurface in ${\bf C}^2$ of order $k_0 > 1$. Let
$(\Sigma, o)$ be the pointed Siegel hypersurface given by the defining equation
$Re w - |z|^2 = 0$. If there is a holomorphic mapping $F:(M,o) \to (\Sigma,o)$
for which $o$ is a regular branch point, then
  (1) $(M,o)$ is defined by the equation $Re w - |z|^{2k_0} = 0$, and
  (2) $F(z,w)$ is equivalent to $(z,w) \mapsto (z^{k_0},w)$ up to a composition
with elements in $Aut (M,o)$ and $Aut (\Sigma,o)$.
  THEOREM (""Global Rigidity""): Let $D$ and $f:D \to B^2$ be as above, and let
$f$ be generically $m$-to-1. Assume that its branch locus $Z_{df}$ admits an
analytic component $V$ with the following properties:
  (1) $f$ is locally a $m$-to-1 branched covering with branch locus $V$ at
every point of $V \cap \partial D$;
  (2) $V \cap \partial D$ is connected and contains no singular point of the
variety $Z_{df}$.
  Then $D$ is biholomorphic to $E_m = \{|z|^{2m} + |w|^2 < 1\}$.
