PostScript figures available from authors",,"10.1086/304549",,"astro-ph",,"  We have searched the IRAS Point Source Catalog and HIRES maps for young
stellar objects (YSOs) in the direction of five \HI high-velocity clouds
(HVCs). In agreement with optical searches in the halo, no evidence was found
for extensive star-forming activity inside the high-latitude HVCs.
Specifically, we have found no signs of star formation or YSOs in the direction
of the A IV cloud or in the very-high-velocity clouds HVC~110-7-465 and
HVC~114-10-440. We have identified only one young star in the direction of the
M~I.1 cloud, which shows almost perfect alignment with a knot of \HI emission.
Because of the small number of early-type stars observed in the halo, the
probability for such a positional coincidence is low; thus, this young star
appears to be physically associated with the M~I.1 cloud. We have also
identified a good YSO candidate in the \HI shell-like structure observed in the
core region of the low-latitude cloud complex H (HVC~131+1-200). This region
could be a supernova remnant with several other YSO candidates formed along the
shock front produced by the explosion. In agreement with recent theoretical
estimates, these results point to a low but significant star-formation rate in
intermediate and high Galactic latitude HVCs. For M~I.1 in particular, we
estimate that the efficiency of the star-formation process is $M(YSO)/M(\HI)\ga
10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ by mass. Such efficiency is sufficient to account for (a) the
existence of the few young blue stars whose ages imply that they were born in
the Galactic halo, and (b) the nonprimordial metallicities inferred for some
HVCs if their metal content proves to be low.

cluster properties are most sensitive to these parameters. We present a set of
large N-body simulations and derive the intrinsic properties of galaxy clusters
in these simulations, which represent a volume of $256^3 h^{-3}$ Mpc^3. The
cosmological scenarios studied differ in either the shape of the power spectrum
of initial fluctuations, its normalization, the density parameter $\Omega_{0}$,
or the Hubble parameter $H_{0}$. Between each of the simulations, only one
parameter is set differently, so that we can study the influence of that
parameter on the cluster properties. The cluster properties that are studied
are the mass, line-of-sight velocity dispersion, peculiar velocity, intrinsic
shape, and orientation with respect to its surroundings. $\sigma_{8}$ has a
large impact on the cluster properties. The latter, viz. the cluster number
density, mass, line-of-sight velocity dispersion and peculiar velocity, are
also determined by $\Omega_{0}$, though somewhat less. Other parameters, such
as $H_{0}$, the tilt of the initial fluctuation spectrum, and the exact shape
of this spectrum, are generally less important. Unlike the other cluster
properties studied, the peculiar velocity is found to depend on all parameters
of the formation scenario. Using scaling relations between the average
properties of the cluster sample and the parameters of the formation scenario,
one may try and interpolate between the scenarios studied here in order to find
the parameters of the scenario that is most consistent with the data.

dynamic mean field theory which is valid for $N\to\infty$. Especially for the

epsilon parameters, $\epsilon_{1,2,3,b}$, to obtain more accurate experimental
values of them by taking into account the new LEP data released at the 28th
ICHEP (1996, Poland). We also compute $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_b$ in the
context of the no-scale $SU(5)\times U(1)$ supergravity model to obtain the
updated constraints by imposing the correlated constraints in terms of the
experimental ellipses in the $\epsilon_1-\epsilon_b$ plane and also by imposing
the new bound on the lightest chargino mass, $m_{\chi^\pm_1}\gtrsim 79$ $ GeV$.
Upon imposing these new experimental results, we find that the situations in
the no-scale model are much more favorable than those in the standard model,
and if $m_t\gtrsim 170$ $ GeV$, then the allowed regions at the 95% C.~L. in
the no-scale model are $\tan\beta\gtrsim 4$ and $m_{\chi^\pm_1}\lesssim 120
(82)$ $ GeV$ for $\mu>0 (\mu<0)$, which are in fact much more stringent than in
our previous analysis. Therefore, assuming that $m_t\gtrsim 170$ $ GeV$, if the
lightest chargino mass bound were to be pushed up only by a few GeV, the sign
on the Higgs mixing term $\mu$ in the no-scale model could well be determined
from the $\epsilon_1-\epsilon_b$ constraint to be positive at the 95% C.~L. At
any rate, better accuracy in the measured $m_t$ from the Tevatron in the near
future combined with the LEP data is most likely to provide a decisive test of
the no-scale $SU(5)\times U(1)$ supergravity model.

compatible with standard tests of special relativity, where a small violation
of Lorentz symmetry (a can, for instance, be the Planck length) produces

spectra are constant above time scales of 3 kyr, proportional to 1/f^2 from
time scales of 500 yr to 3 kyr, and constant again below time scales of 500 yr.
The 3 kyr time scale is associated with the decay time of the quadrupole
moment. We test the hypothesis that reversals are the result of variations in
dipole intensity with a 1/f spectrum which occasionally are large enough to
cross the zero intensity value. Synthetic binormal time series with a 1/f power
spectrum representing variations in the earth's dipole moment are constructed.
Synthetic reversals from these time series exhibit statistics in good agreement
with the reversal record. 1/f noise behavior is reproduced with a model of
magnetic diffusion in the earth's core driven by dynamo action modeled as a
random amplification or destruction of the local magnetic field.

  the frequency-size distribution of landslides","latex file, 20 pages, 10 postscript figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph cond-mat",,"  Power spectral analyses of soil moisture variability are carried out from
scales of 100 m to 10 km on the microwave remotely-sensed data from the Washita
experimental watershed during 1992. The power spectrum S(k) has an
approximately power-law dependence on wave number k with exponent -1.8. This
behavior is consistent with the behavior of a stochastic differential equation
for soil moisture at a point. This behavior has important consequences for the
frequency-size distribution of landslides. We present the cumulative
frequency-size distributions of landslides induced by precipitation in Japan
and Bolivia as well as landslides triggered by the 1994 Northridge, California
earthquake. Large landslides in these regions, despite being triggered by
different mechanisms, have a cumulative frequency-size distribution with a
power-law dependence on area with an exponent ranging from -1.5 to -2. We use a
soil moisture field with the above statistics in conjunction with a slope
stability analysis to model the frequency-size distribution of landslides. In
our model landslides occur when a threshold shear stress dependent on cohesion,
pore pressure, internal friction and slope angle is exceeded. This implies a
threshold dependence on soil moisture and slope angle since these factors are
primarily dependent on soil moisture. Abstract continued in paper.
