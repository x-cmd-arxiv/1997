  American Mathematical Society and International Press, 1999, pp. 263-277",,"DUK-M-97-04","alg-geom math.AG",,"  It is frequently possible to produce new Calabi-Yau threefolds from old ones
by a process of allowing the complex structure to degenerate to a singular one,
and then performing a resolution of singularities. (Some care is needed to
ensure that the Calabi-Yau condition be preserved.) There has been speculation
that all Calabi-Yau threefolds could be linked in this way, and considerable
evidence has been amassed in this direction. We propose here a natural way to
relate this construction to the string-theoretic phenomenon known as ``mirror
symmetry.'' We formulate a conjecture which in principle could predict mirror
partners for all Calabi-Yau threefolds, provided that all were indeed linked by
the degeneration/resolution process. The conjecture produces new mirrors from
old, and so requires some initial mirror manifold construction---such as
Greene-Plesser orbifolding---as a starting point. (Lecture given at the CIRM

noise cutoff frequency track $\dot M$ more closely than count rate. The QPO
increases in rms amplitude from ($11 \pm 1.3$) % at 3 keV to ($37 \pm 12$) % at
23 keV; the fractional amplitude of the band-limited noise is
energy-independent. This suggests different sites of origin for these two
phenomena. The spectrum of the oscillating flux roughly corresponds to a black

estimates of an anomalous disc shear viscosity. The angular momentum lost from
the disc during the encounter is derived from linear theory, for distant
fly-bys, as well as the changes to the disc orientation expected in
non-coplanar encounters. It is shown that the target discs can become warped
and precess by a small amount during non-coplanar encounters. This small
precession is shown to give rise to a relative tilt of the disc which is always
more important for determining its final orientation than is the change to the
orbital inclination. We discuss the implications of our results for
protostellar accretion discs and planetary systems.

the shock velocity lies in the unstable range; they last until the shock slows

Wilson-Polyakov line as the order parameter. The Wilson-Polyakov line remains
very small at strong coupling and becomes non-zero at weak coupling, signalling
a confinement to deconfinement phase transition. The decondensation of monopole
loops is responsible for this phase transition. A finite size scaling analysis
of the susceptibility of the Wilson line gives a ratio for $\gamma/\nu$ which
is quite close to the corresponding value in the 3-d planar model. A scaling
behaviour for the monopole loop distribution function is also established at
the point of the second order phase transition. A measurement of the plaquette
susceptibility at the transition point shows that it does not scale with the
four dimensional volume as is expected of a first order bulk transition.

transverse expansion of the systems created in central collision of lead nuclei
at CERN SPS, BNL RHIC, and CERN LHC, and undergoing a first order phase
transition to hadronic matter is considered. A large production of low mass
($M<$ 0.3 GeV) dileptons, and soft photons ($p_T<$ 0.4 GeV) is seen to emanate
from the bremsstrahlung of quarks and pions. We find an increase by a factor of
2--4 in the low mass dilepton and soft photon yield as we move from SPS to RHIC
energies, and an increase by an order of magnitude as we move from SPS to LHC
energies. Most of the soft radiations are found to originate from pion driven
processes at SPS and RHIC energies, while at the LHC energies the quark and the
pion driven processes contribute by a similar amount. The study of the
transverse mass distribution is seen to provide interesting details of the
evolution. We also find a unique universal behaviour for the ratio of $M^2$
weighted transverse mass distribution for $M=$ 0.1 GeV to that for $M=$ 0.2 and
0.3 GeV, as a function of $M_T$, for SPS, RHIC, and LHC energies, in the

to Newton`s law of gravitation, however, is a secondary effect and a

Both m1 and m2 emit and absorb gravitational radiation. Corresponding to the
laws of optics the absorption is connected with an impulse transfer that
produces the repulsive force. If, however, m1 and m2 are embedded in the
gravitational radiation produced by all the masses of the universe the
absorption by m1 and m2 leads to a reduction of the intensity of the
gravitational radiation between them, thus creating an attractive force exactly
as described by Newton's law. The so called universal gravitational constant is
no constant. It locally depends on the arrangement of the masses in the
universe. It can accept high values which are usually explained by the
existence of dark matter. Due to the primary forces of repulsive nature between
all masses the expansion of the universe is an intrinsic property. The balance
