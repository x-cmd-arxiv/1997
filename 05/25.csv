cataclysmic variables (CVs) in the very old open cluster NGC 6791. One of these
variables, known as B8, was observed by Rucinski, Kaluzny & Hilditch (1996) to
undergo a large magnitude outburst in 1995. The spectrum of this star outside
the outburst, obtained by us with MMT, shows clearly the emission lines
characteristic for dwarf novae. We observed the second star, known as B7, to
undergo large ($\sim3 mag$) drop in its brightness over $\sim 10 days$. The
spectrum of B7 obtained in the high state resembles spectra of nova-like CVs.
This star a likely member of UX~UMa subtype of CVs. Variables B7 and B8
represent only the second and the third cataclysmic variables known in open
clusters. Variable B7 has observational characteristics which would make it
difficult to identify as a CV with some of the methods being currently used in
surveys for CVs in globular clusters.

atmospheres, spectra, colors, and evolution of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs)
and brown dwarfs for effective temperatures below 1300 K. This theory
encompasses most of the mass/age parameter space occupied by substellar objects
and is the first spectral study down to 100 K. These calculations are in aid of
the multitude of searches being conducted or planned around the world for giant
planets and brown dwarfs and reveal the exotic nature of the class.
Generically, absorption by H_2 at longer wavelengths and H_2O opacity windows
at shorter wavelengths conspire to redistribute flux blueward. Below 1200 K,
methane is the dominant carbon bearing molecule and is a universal diagnostic
feature of EGP and brown dwarf spectra. We find that the primary bands in which
to search are $Z$ (\sim 1.05 \mic), $J$ (\sim 1.2 \mic), $H$ (\sim 1.6 \mic),
$K$ (\sim 2.2 \mic), $M$ (\sim 5 \mic), and $N$ (\sim 10 \mic), that
enhancements of the emergent flux over blackbody values, in particular in the
near infrared, can be by many orders of magnitude, and that the infrared colors
of EGPs and brown dwarfs are much bluer than previously believed. In
particular, relative to $J$ and $H$, the $K$ band flux is reduced by CH_4 and
H_2 absorption. Furthermore, we derive that for T_{eff}s below 1200 K most or
all true metals are sequestered below the photosphere, that an interior
radiative zone is a generic feature of substellar objects, and that clouds of
H_2O and NH_3 are formed for T_{eff}s below \sim 400 K and \sim 200 K,
respectively. This study is done for solar-metallicity objects in isolation and
does not include the effects of stellar insolation. Nevertheless, it is an
attempt to bridge the gap between the planetary and stellar realms and to
develop a non-gray theory of objects from 0.3 \mj (``saturn'') to 70 \mj
($\sim$0.07 \mo). We find that the detection ranges for brown dwarf/EGP
discovery of both ground-- and space-based telescopes are larger than
previously estimated.

confined hadronic and quark matter phases, assumed to be a first order
transition, was strictly excluded from neutron stars. This, however, was due to
a seemingly innocuous idealization which has approximated away important
physics. The reason is that neutron stars constitute multi-component bodies
rather than single-component ones formerly (and incorrectly) used to describe
the deconfinement phase transition in neutron stars. So, contrary to earlier
claims, `neutron' stars may very well contain quark matter in their cores
surrounded by a mixed-phase region of quark and hadronic matter. Such objects
are called hybrid stars. The structure of such stars as well as an observable
signature that could signal the existence of quark matter in their cores are
discussed in this paper.

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographs are simulated by calculating the

STM tends to image the undercoordinated Ti atoms, in spite of the physical
protrusion of the O atoms, giving an apparent reversal of topographic contrast

coupled Super Yang Mills Theory in 2+1 dimensions almost determines low energy,
large impact parameter ten dimensional graviton scattering at zero longitudinal
momentum in the Matrix model of IIB string theory. We then show that amplitudes
involving arbitrary transverse momentum transfer are governed by instanton
processes similar to the Polchinski Pouliot process. Finally we consider the
influence of instantons on a conjectured nonrenormalization theorem. This
theorem is violated by instanton processes. Far from being a problem, this fact
is seen to be crucial to the consistency of the IIB interpretation. We suggest
