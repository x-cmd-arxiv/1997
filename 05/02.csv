are analyzed using color-magnitude (CM) diagrams plotted from VRI photometry of
736 stars. The distance to the galaxy is estimated through the position of the
tip or the red giant branch. Two acceptable results have been obtained:
0.77+/-0.07 Mpc and 0.96+/-0.07 Mpc, although the first value is favored by
complementary considerations on the stellar content of the galaxy. Both values
make LGS3 a possible satellite of M31 or of M33. The SFH is investigated for
each of the two adopted distances comparing the observed CM diagrams with model
CM diagrams computed for different star formation rates (psi(t)) and chemical
enrichment laws (Z(t)).
  The results are compatible with LGS3 having been forming stars since an early
epoch, 15-12 Gyr ago, at an almost constant rate if distance is 0.77 Mpc or at
an exponentially decreasing rate if distance is 0.96 Mpc. According to our
models, the current metallicity would range from Z~0.0007 to Z~0.002. Other
results are the current psi(t): (0.55+/-0.04)x10^(-10) Mo yr^(-1) pc^(-2) or
(0.47+/-0.07)x10^(-10) Mo yr^(-1) pc^(-2), depending of the distance, and its
average for the entire life of the galaxy, <psi>=(1.4+/-0.1)x10^(-10) Mo

region is 0.2, which is compatible with the fact that no HII regions have been
found in the galaxy. Its fraction of gas relative to the mass intervening in
the chemical evolution is about 0.40 and its percentage of dark matter (that
which cannot be explained as stellar remnants or by extrapolation of the used
IMF to low masses) is 95%. The results for psi(t) and Z(t) for d=0.77 Mpc are

star formation history (SFH) of Local Group (LG) galaxies using (HST) data.
This method has proven to be successful in the analysis of the SFH of the same
kind of galaxies using ground-based observations. It is based on the comparison
of observed CMDs with a set of model CMDs. The latter are computed assuming
different evolutionary scenarios, and include a detailed simulation of
observational effects. HST CMDs are ~3 mags deeper than typical ground-based
CMDs, allowing the observation, for all LG galaxies, of a part of the CMD that
up till now had remained accessible only for the very nearest galaxies. A very
important feature that will become accessible is the HB+red-clump. The
distribution of stars along this structure is quite sensitive to age and
metallicity and should provide a very important improvement in the time
resolution of the SFH for stars older than ~2-3 Gyr. We show and discuss four
model CMDs which would be comparable with CMDs from deep HST observations.
These model CMDs represent the following evolutionary scenarios corresponding
to a wide range of dwarf galaxy sub-types from dI to dE: A) a constant SFR from
15Gyr ago to the present time; B) as A), but with the SFR stopped 0.5 Gyr ago;
C) a constant SFR in the age range 10-9Gyr and D) as C) but in the age range
15-12 Gyr. In all four cases a range of metallicity from Z=0.0001 to Z=0.004
has been assumed. The present analysis is just a first qualitative approach to
what one may expect to find in the CMDs of LG galaxies. However a complete set
of model CMDs must be computed to analize the data for each galaxy, using the
crowding effects derived for that particular galaxy.

a 3 sigma uncertainty of 0.25. We identify the ionizing star and determine its
intrinsic K magnitude. The star does not have an infrared excess and so appears
to be no longer accreting. The K magnitude and the bolometric luminosity allow
us to place limits on the location of the ionizing star in the HR diagram. The
3 sigma upper limit on the effective temperature of the ionizing star is 42500
K. We favor a luminosity appropriate for star with a mass in excess of about 60
solar masses. The limit on the temperature and luminosity exclude stars on the
ZAMS and stars within 10^6 yr of the ZAMS. Since the age of the UC HII region
is estimated to be only about 10^5 yr, we suggest that this is direct evidence
that the stellar birth line for massive stars at twice solar metallicity must
be significantly redder than the ZAMS.

positron-proton scattering in a new kinematical domain. The data were taken
with the H1 detector at the HERA storage ring in 1994, in which 27.5 GeV
positrons collided with 820 GeV protons at a centre of mass energy sqrt{s}=300
GeV. The observed enhancement of the like-sign correlations at low invariant
masses is related to the dimensions of the hadronic source. The data are
compared to different QCD models where the hadronization is performed with the
string-fragmentation model. Results are presented for the first time separately
for diffractive and non-diffractive scattering, in domains of four-momentum
transfer, Bjorken-x, and hadronic center of mass energy, and in intervals of
charged particle multiplicity. The observed source radii do not differ strongly
from those measured in lower energy lepton-nucleon inelastic scattering, and
e^+e^- annihilation.

contains an incomplete vector-like generation and can come from hierarchies
between scales of breaking of different grand unified groups. Hierarchies and

single parameter epsilon' representing the breaking U(2) -> U(1). As a

our considerations to prior probability distributions belonging to a certain
one-parameter family, $q(u)$, $-\infty < u < 1$. Within this setting, we are
able to compute exact redundancy formulas, for which we find the asymptotic
limits. We compare our quantum asymptotic redundancy formulas to those derived
by naively applying the classical counterparts of Clarke and Barron, and find
certain common features. Our results are based on formulas we obtain for the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $2^n \times 2^n$ (Bayesian density) matrices,
$\zeta_{n}(u)$. These matrices are the weighted averages (with respect to
$q(u)$) of all possible tensor products of $n$ identical $2 \times 2$ density
matrices, representing the two-level quantum systems. We propose a form of {\it
universal} coding for the situation in which the density matrix describing an
ensemble of quantum signal states is unknown. A sequence of $n$ signals would
be projected onto the dominant eigenspaces of $\ze_n(u)$.

The Hartree-Fock and the pairing fields are calculated in a self-consistent
way. The energy gap is the result of a strong cancellation between the scalar
and vector components of the pairing field. We find that the pair amplitude
vanishes beyond a certain value of momentum of the paired nucleons. This fact
determines an effective cutoff in the gap equation. The value of this cutoff
gives an energy gap in agreement with the estimates of non relativistic
calculations.

matter is treated at all levels of study, from Newtonian mechanics to quantum
field theory, antimatter is solely treated at the level of second quantization.
For the purpose of initiating the restoration of full equivalence in the
treatments of matter and antimatter in due time, in this paper we present a
classical representation of antimatter which begins at the primitive Newtonian
level with expected images at all subsequent levels. By recalling that charge
conjugation of particles into antiparticles is anti-automorphic, the proposed
theory of antimatter is based on a new map, called isoduality, which is also
anti-automorphic, yet it is applicable beginning at the classical level and
then persists at the quantum level. As part of our study, we present novel
anti-isomorphic isodual images of the Galilean, special and general
relativities and show the compatibility of their representation of antimatter
with all available classical experimental knowledge, that on electromagnetic
interactions. We also identify the prediction of antigravity for antimatter in
the field of matter (or vice-versa) without any claim on its validity, and
defer its resolution to specific experiments. To avoid a prohibitive length,
the paper is restricted to the classical treatment which had not been
sufficiently treated until now. Studies on operator profiles, such as the
equivalence of isoduality and charge conjugation and the implication of the
isodual theory in particle physics, are conducted in a separate paper.

SS for n observables X_i can be constructed as eigenstates of their linear
complex combinations or as states which minimize the Robertson uncertainty
relation. When X_i close a Lie algebra L the generalized SS could also be
introduced as orbit of Aut(L^C). It is shown that for the nilpotent algebra h_N
the three generalizations are equivalent. For the simple su(1,1) the family of
eigenstates of uK_- + vK_+ (K_\pm being lowering and raising operators) is a
family of ideal K_1-K_2 SS, but it cannot be represented as an Aut(su^C(1,1))
orbit although the SU(1,1) group related coherent states (CS) with symmetry are
contained in it.

squeezing) of the generalized even CS |z,u,v;+> are demonstrated. The states
