simulations of cosmic string networks in flat, Minkowski space ignoring the
effects of cosmological expansion. These strings have more small scale
structure than those from an expanding universe simulation - fractal dimension
1.3 for Minkowski versus 1.1 for expanding - but share the same qualitative
features. Lensing simulations show that for both point-like and extended
objects, strings produce patterns unlike more traditional lenses, and, in
particluar, the kinks in strings tend to generate demagnified images which
reside close to the string. Thus lensing acts as a probe of the small scale
structure of a string. Estimates of lensing probablity suggest that for string
energy densities consistant with string seeded structure formation, on the
order of tens of string lenses should be observed in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey quasar catalog. We propose a search strategy in which string lenses
would be identified in the SDSS quasar survey, and the string nature of the
lens can be confirmed by the observation of nearby high redshift galaxies which
are also be lensed by the string.

single-particle-weighted statistic $\sigma_1$, which can be considered as an
estimate of the one-dimensional rms peculiar velocity dispersion of galaxies
relative to their neighbors, and which can be interpreted by means of a
filtered version of the Cosmic-Energy equation. We calculate this statistic for
the all-sky survey of IRAS galaxies, finding $\sigma_1=95 \pm 16 $ km/sec. The
UGC catalog yields a higher value, $\sigma_1=130 \pm 15$ km/s. We calibrate our
procedure by means of mock catalogs constructed from N-body simulations and
find that our method is stable and has modest biases which can easily be
corrected. We use the measured values of $\sigma_1$ in a filtered Layzer-Irvine

that $\tilde\Omega\approx 0.14 \pm 0.05$ for both the IRAS and UGC catalogs,

with a trend of an effective $\Omega$ that increases gradually with scale.

of 1320 arcmin^2 in the L1630 region, concentrating on the region away from the

Previous studies found that star formation in L1630 occurs mainly in four
localized clusters, which in turn are associated with the four most massive
molecular cores (Lada et al. 1991; Lada 1992). The goal of this study is to
look for a distributed population of pre-main-sequence stars in the outlying
areas outside the known star-forming cores. More than 60% of the
pre-main-sequence stars in the active star forming regions of NGC 2024 and NGC
2023 show a near-infrared excess in the color-color diagram. In the outlying
areas of L1630, excluding the known star forming regions, we found that among
510 infrared sources with the near-infrared colors ((J-H) and (H-K)) determined
and photometric uncertainty at K better than 0.10 mag, the fraction of the
sources with a near-infrared excess is 3%--8%; the surface density of the
sources with a near-infrared excess is less than half of that found in the
distributed population in L1641, and 1/20 of that in the young cluster NGC
2023. This extremely low fraction and low surface density of sources with a
near-infrared excess strongly indicates that recent star formation activity has
been very low in the outlying region of L1630. The sources without a
near-infrared excess could be either background/foreground field stars, or
associated with the cloud, but formed a long time ago (more than 2 Myrs). Our
results are consistent with McKee's model of photoionization-regulated star
formation.

poloidal speed leaves the surface of a rotating disk and is accelerated and
redirected toward the pole by helical magnetic fields threading the disk. At
large distances from the disk, the flow streamlines asymptote to wrap around
the surfaces of nested cylinders. In constrast to previous disk wind modeling,
we have explicitly implemented the cylindrical asymptotic boundary condition to
examine the consequences for flow dynamics. The solutions are characterized by
the logarithmic gradient of the magnetic field strength and the ratios between
the footpoint radius R_0 and asymptotic radius R_1 of streamlines; the Alfven
radius must be found as an eigenvalue. Cylindrical solutions require the
magnetic field to drop less steeply than 1/R. We find that the asymptotic
poloidal speed on any streamline is typically just a few tenths of the Kepler
speed at the corresponding disk footpoint. The asymptotic toroidal Alfven speed
is, however, a few times the footpoint Kepler speed. We discuss the
implications of the models for interpretations of observed optical jets and
molecular outflows from young stellar systems. We suggest that the difficulty
of achieving strong collimation in vector velocity simultaneously with a final
speed comparable to the disk rotation rate argues against isolated jets and in
favor of models with broader winds.

fluid disturbances in the form of fast-magnetosonic waves along the separatrix
surface. If the fast-magnetosonic speed is smaller in the polar regions than in
the equatorial regions, the critical surface has a prolate shape for radial
poloidal field lines. In this case, only the waves that propagate towards the
equator can escape from the super-fast-magnetosonic region and collimate
polewards as they propagate outwards in the sub-fast-magnetosonic regions. We
further discuss the capabilities of such collimated waves in accelerating

consistent with the blastwave model. The fireball optical depth at radio
frequencies is much smaller than previously estimated, which accounts for the
observed radio emission. The initial suppression of optical flux is consistent
with that predicted due to electron cooling. The combined radio and optical
data imply that the fireball energy is $\sim10^{52}$erg, and that the density

This model assumes that a point source of relativistic leptons (e+,e-)
illuminates the accretion disk of the AGN by Inverse Compton process. This disk
is supposed to be simply represented by a finite slab which radiates only the
energy reprocessed from the hot source. The radiation field within the hot
source region is therefore highly anisotropic, which strongly influences the
Inverse Compton process. The different Eddington parameters characterizing the
radiative balance of this system have been calculated self-consistently in the
Newtonian case (paper I) giving a universal spectrum for a given inclination
angle. In this paper, we take into account relativistic effects by including
the gravitational redshift, the Doppler boosting and the gravitational focusing
due to the central supermassive black hole. This has the effect of modifying
the radial temperature profile in the innermost region of the disk (at some
gravitational radii). However, the spectrum is hardly different from that
obtained in the Newtonian case, unless the hot source is very close to the
black hole. These results are clearly different from standard accretion disk
models where the gravitational energy is mainly released in the vicinity of the
black hole.

source contains ultrarelativistic leptons scattering the disk soft photons by
Inverse Compton (IC) process. Using a simple formula to describe the IC process

distribution of soft and hard radiation in the Newtonian geometry. The radial
profile of the disk effective temperature is also univoquely determined. The

by the winding itself. We present arguments why this winding leaves the mass
spectrum continuous. The lower bound on the mass spectrum is set by the winding
number and corresponds to a BPS state.

refinements of the superposition is proposed that may converge to the exact
functional. As an illustration, a simple numerical approximation for the
effective potential is worked out based on minimization with respect to five
variational parameters. A variational principle is formulated for the fermion
vacuum energy as a functional of the scalar fields to which the fermions are
coupled. The discussion in this paper is given for scalar and fermion

more involved structure of ultraviolet divergences and is deferred to future

"math/9705201","Peter Ebenfelt","Peter Ebenfelt","Normal forms and biholomorphic equivalence of real hypersurfaces in C^3",,,,,"math.CV",,"  We consider the problem of describing the local biholomorphic equivalence
class of a real-analytic hypersurface $M$ at a distinguished point $p_0\in M$
by giving a normal form for such objects. In order for the normal form to carry
useful information about the biholomorphic equivalence class, we shall require
that the transformation to normal form is unique modulo some finite dimensional
group. A classical result due to Chern--Moser gives such a normal form for Levi
nondegenerate hypersurfaces.
  The main results in this paper concern real-analytic hypersurfaces $M$ in
$\Bbb C^3$ at certain Levi degenerate points $p_0\in M$, namely points at which
$M$ is 2-nondegenerate. We give a partial normal form for all such $(M,p_0)$,
i.e. a normal form for the data associated with 2-nondegeneracy. We also give a
complete formal normal form for such $(M,p_0)$ under the additional condition
that the Levi form has rank one at $p_0$. This result, combined with a recent
theorem due to the author, M. S. Baouendi, and L. P. Rothschild stating that
formal equivalences between real-analytic finitely nondegenerate hypersurfaces
converge, gives a description of the biholomorphic equivalence class of a
real-analytic hypersurface in $\Bbb C^3$ at a point of 2-nondegeneracy where
the rank of the Levi form is one.

system $A_{n-1}$. The proof is based on an explicit formula for the
characteristic polynomial, which is of independent combinatorial significance.
Here our previous derivation of this formula is simplified and extended to
similar formulae for all but the exceptional root systems. The conjecture
follows in these cases.
