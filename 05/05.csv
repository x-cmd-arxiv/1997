0.00001$ d. The absorption-line radial velocities were obtained at the 1.93-m
Haute-Provence (OHP) telescope with the Elodie echelle spectrograph by on-line
numerical cross-correlation. The M0Ve primary exhibits strong Balmer and Ca II
H+K line emission, placing this system amongst the most active BY Dra stars.
While only the primary contributes to the continuum and the absorption line
spectrum, the dM5e secondary is detected through its H$\alpha$ emission. The
mass ratio, estimated from the amplitudes of the emission radial velocity
curves, is $q = M_{2}/M_{1} \sim 0.4$. CCD photometry in the $B$ and $V$ bands,
obtained with the OHP 1.2--m and 0.80--m telescopes, shows that the optical
flux is modulated at the spectroscopic period with a total amplitude of 0.2 mag
and little or no color change in $B-V$. The light curve, which can be
attributed to rotational modulation of the synchronized active primary star,
shows extrema near quadratures and also exhibits long-term variations in
average brightness (by 0.1 mag), which are accompanied by changes around the
photometric minimum. A secondary minimum appears at phase 0.5, indicating a
partial eclipse of the primary star. We find an X-ray to bolometric luminosity
ratio of $\log (L_{x}/L_{bol}) \sim -3.1 \pm 0.14$ which supports the concept

treat the evolution of these products carefully. The mixture and disparity of
the relevant timescales (hydrodynamic, thermal relaxation and nuclear burning)
and of the important physical assumptions between the codes makes the combined
analysis of the problem challenging, especially during the initial thermal
relaxation of the star. In particular, the treatment of convection is
important, and semiconvection must be modeled in some detail.
  The products of seven head-on collisions are evolved through their initial
thermal relaxation, and then through the main sequence phase to the base of the
giant branch. Their evolutionary tracks are presented. In contrast to the
assumptions in previous work, these collision products do not develop
substantial convective regions during their thermal relaxation, and therefore
are not mixed significantly after the collision.

does not match the B-band LF from the Stromlo/APM survey, having a
normalization 1.6 times higher. We see compelling evidence that B-band field
galaxy LF evolves with redshift. The evolution is strongest for the population
of star-forming galaxies with [OII]3727 rest-frame equivalent widths greater
than 10A. The population of red, quiescent galaxies shows no sign of evolution
to z = 0.5. The evolution of the LF which we observe is consistent with the
findings of other faint galaxy redshift surveys. The fraction of galaxies with
[OII] emission increases rapidly with redshift, but the fraction of galaxies
with strong Hdelta 4101 absorption, a signature of a burst of star formation,
does not. We thus conclude that the star formation in distant galaxies is
primarily long-lived.
  We also compute the LFs of the Corona Borealis supercluster and the A2069
supercluster. The shapes of the two supercluster LFs are broadly similar to the
shape of the local LF. However, there are important differences. Both
supercluster LFs have an excess of very bright galaxies. In addition, there is
a suggestion of an upturn in the LF for galaxies fainter than M(B) = -17 mag.

this generalization to metal clusters (Al, Ga, Li, Na, K, Cs), we gain
additional insights about the odd-even alternations, seen in their ionization
potentials. In this generalization, in addition to the electronic degrees of
freedom, we allow the positive jellium background to expand as the clusters'
polarization increases. In fact, our self-consistent calculations of the
energetics of alkali metal clusters with spherical geometries, in the context
of density functional theory and local spin density approximation, show that
the energy of a cluster is minimized for a configuration with maximum spin
compensation (MSC). That is, for clusters with even number of electrons, the
energy minimization gives rise to complete compensation
($N_\uparrow=N_\downarrow$), and for clusters with odd number of electrons,
only one electron remains uncompensated ($N_\uparrow-N_\downarrow=1$). It is
this MSC-rule which gives rise to alternations in the ionization potentials.
Aside from very few exceptions, the MSC-rule is also at work for other metal
culsters (Al, Ga) of various sizes.

proportional to its surface (horizon) area, the ``statistical mechanical''

After a review of some of the difficulties in answering these questions, I
propose an explanation of the law of entropy increase which comes near to a
proof in the context of the ``semi-classical'' approximation, and which also
provides a proof in full quantum gravity under the assumption that the latter
fulfills certain natural expectations, like the existence of a conserved energy
definable at infinity. This explanation seems to require a fundamental
spacetime discreteness in order for the entropy to be consistently finite, and
I recall briefly some of the ideas for what the discreteness might be. If such
ideas are right, then our knowledge of the horizon entropy will allow us to
``count the atoms of spacetime''.

the observables have only finitely many sectors. Whereas the superselection
structure in 1+1 dimensions typically does not arise from a group, the DR
construction is applicable to `degenerate sectors', the existence of which (in
the rational case) is equivalent to non-invertibility of Verlinde's S-matrix.
We prove Rehren's conjecture that the enlarged theory is non-degenerate, which
implies that every degenerate theory is an `orbifold' theory. Thus, the
