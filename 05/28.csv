tensor modes in a model-independent way and thereby circumvent the

$10-20 \mu K \sqrt{sec}$, the sensitivity to a tensor signal is always
dominated by the polarization map. With a detector sensitivity of order $1 \mu

tensor modes by two to three orders of magnitude. Even a small amount of

that the sensitivity of the Planck Surveyor to tensor modes is significantly
improved with polarization, even taking into account the resulting degradation

results favor most aspects of these galaxies as being shaped by gravitational
interactions with companions, rather than the asymmetric pressure from motion
through an external medium. The old stars follow the asymmetric structures of
young stars and ionized gas, which suggests a tidal origin for the lopsided
appearance of these galaxies. In NGC 2276, the H I and star-forming regions are
strongly concentrated along the western edge of the disk. In this case, the
ROSAT HRI detects the brightest star-forming regions as well as the diffuse
disk emission, the most distant galaxy with such a detection. An asymmetric
ionization gradient in the H II regions suggests radial movement of gas, which
might have occurred in either tidal or wind scenarios. The X-ray emission from
NGC 1961 is dominated by a point source near the nucleus of the galaxy but
extended emission is seen out to a radius of ~0.8'. Previous studies of the
enrichment of the intragroup medium in the NGC 2300 group indicates that
stripping may be important in this system, but the density of the IGM is much
too tenuous to effectively strip the gas from the galaxy. However, we propose
that gravitational interactions in the group environment may enhance stripping.
During a gravitational encounter the disk of the spiral galaxy may be warped,
making ram pressure stripping more efficient than in a quiescent disk.

substructure in galaxy clusters which are formed by the collapse of high
density peaks in a gaussian random field. The radial mass distributions of the
clusters are computed from the spherical accretion model using the adiabatic
approximation following Ryden & Gunn. For a cluster of mass, M(r,t), we compute
the quantity dM/M_bar at a cosmic time t and within a radius r, where dM is the
accreted mass and M_bar is the average mass of the cluster during the previous
relaxation time, which is computed individually for each cluster. For a real
cluster in three dimensions we argue that dM/M_bar should be strongly
correlated with the low order multipole ratios, Phi^{int}_l/Phi^{int}_0, of the
potential due to matter interior to r. It is shown that the expected
correlation between dM/M_bar and Phi^{int}_l/Phi^{int}_0 extends to the
two-dimensional multipole ratios, Psi^{int}_m/Psi^{int}_0, which are well
defined observables of the cluster density distribution.
  The strongest dependence of dM/M_bar on Omega_0 (lambda_0=0) occurs at z=0
where dM/M_bar propto Omega_0^{1/2} for relaxation times ~1-2 crossing times
and only very weakly depends on mass and radius. The fractional accreted mass
in CDM models with Omega_0+lambda_0=1 depends very weakly on Omega_0 and has a
magnitude similar to the Omega_0=1 value. dM/M_bar evolves more rapidly with
redshift in low-density universes and decreases significantly with radius for
Omega_0=1 models for z > ~0.5. We discuss how to optimize constraints on
Omega_0 and lambda_0 using cluster morphologies.

generator (encoder) and matched response system (decoder) to behave identically
despite the instability of chaotic oscillations. Chaotic oscillations cover a
wide spectral domain and can efficiently mask an information signal scrambled
by the chaotic encoder. At the same time the wide spectrum poses intrinsic
difficulties in the chaotic decoding if the chaotic signal is transmitted over
real communication channels with limited bandwidth. We address this problem
both numerically and experimentally. Two alternative ways to improve
communication with chaos over band-limited channels are investigated. The first
method employs a matching filter in the decoder which compensates channel
distortions of the transmitted signal. This modification does not change the
individual dynamics of chaotic systems in the synchronous state however the
information signal injected into the driving system, breaks the symmetry
between encoder and decoder and therefore exact recovery is impossible. We show
that this approach has limited ability for synchronization of chaotic encoder.
The second approach does not use adaptive compensation but relies on the design
of chaotic oscillators which produce narrow-band chaotic waveforms.

carriers is used as a probe of the electronic structure of YBa_2Cu_3O_(7-d) in
the insulating d~0.8 and metallic d~0.1 phases. The energy relaxation rate to
phonons is obtained by measuring the non-equilibrium phonon occupation number,
n_neq, with pulsed Raman Stokes/anti-Stokes spectroscopy using 1.5 and 70 ps
long laser pulses. We can distinguish between relaxation via extended band
states and localized states, since theoretically in the former, the relaxation
is expected to be virtually T-independent, while in the latter it is strongly
T-dependent. From the experiment - which shows strong temperature dependence of
n_neq - we deduce that at least part of the PE carrier relaxation proceeds via
hopping between localized states and we propose a simple theoretical model of
the relaxation process. In addition, we compare the coupling of different
vibrational modes to the carriers to find that the apical O vibrational mode is
significantly more involved in the energy relaxation process that the in-plane
340 cm^(-1}) mode. This implies that the localized states are mainly (but not
entirely) coupled to out-of plane vibrations.

problem. Explicit examples of negative-norm physical states (ghosts) are found.
Thus we discuss possibilities for obtaining a sensible theory. The tachyon
propagation and the target-space geometry are also discussed. This is the first
attempt to quantize a string in a black hole background with an infinite number
of propagating modes. Although we cannot overcome all the problems, our results
may provide a useful basis for both subjects.

show that if $q$ is a suitable root of unity, there exist finite-dimensional,
unitary representations corresponding to essentially all the classical
one-particle representations with (half)integer spin, with the same structure
at low energies as in the classical case. In the massless case for spin $\geq
1$, the ""naive"" representations are unitarizable only after factoring out a
subspace of ""pure gauges"", as classically. Unitary many-particle
representations are defined, with the correct classical limit. Furthermore, we
identify a remarkable element $Q$ in the center of $U_q(g)$, which plays the
role of a BRST operator in the case of $U_q(so(2,3))$ at roots of unity, for
any spin $\geq 1$. The associated ghosts are an intrinsic part of the
indecomposable representations. We show how to define an involution on algebras
of creation and anihilation operators at roots of unity, in an example
corresponding to non-identical particles. It is shown how nonabelian gauge
fields appear naturally in this framework, without having to define connections
on fiber bundles. Integration on Quantum Euclidean space and sphere and on
Anti-de Sitter space is studied as well. We give a conjecture how $Q$ can be
used in general to analyze the structure of indecomposable representations, and
to define a new, completely reducible associative (tensor) product of
representations at roots of unity, which generalizes the standard ""truncated""
tensor product as well as our many-particle representations.

linear systems of this type Darboux introduced Laplace transformations,
generalising the classical transformations in the scalar case. It is
demonstrated that Laplace transformations can be pulled back to the
transformations of the corresponding hydrodynamic type systems. We discuss
periodic Laplace sequences of with the emphasize on the simplest nontrivial
case of period 2. For 3-component systems in Riemann invariants a complete
discription of closed quadruples is proposed. They turn to be related to a
special quadratic reduction of the (2+1)-dimensional 3-wave system which can be
reduced to a triple of pairwize commuting Monge-Ampere equations. In terms of
the Lame and rotation coefficients Laplace transformations have a natural
interpretation as the symmetries of the Dirac operator, associated with the
(2+1)-dimensional n-wave system. The 2-component Laplace transformations can be
interpreted also as the symmetries of the (2+1)-dimensional integrable
equations of Davey-Stewartson type. Laplace transformations of hydrodynamic
type systems originate from a canonical geometric correspondence between
systems of conservation laws and line congruences in projective space.
