mapping experiments, including 1/f noise, distilling the cosmological

find that in all cases, the resulting error bars can we well approximated by
simple and intuitive analytic expressions. Using these approximations, we
discuss how to maximize the scientific return of CMB mapping experiments given
the practical constraints at hand, and our main conclusions are as follows.
  (1) For a given resolution and sensitivity, it is best to cover a sky area
such that the signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element (pixel) is of order
unity.
  (2) It is best to avoid excessively skinny observing regions, narrower than a
few degrees.
  (3) The minimum-variance mapmaking method can reduce the effects of 1/f noise
by a substantial factor, but only if the scan pattern is thoroughly
interconnected.
  (4) 1/f noise produces a 1/l contribution to the angular power spectrum for
well connected single-beam scanning, as compared to virtually white noise for a
two-beam scan pattern such as that of the MAP satellite.

computing M/L_B for a maximal disk. We find that these galaxies have maximal
disk mass-to-light ratios M/L_B = 1.5 - 3.5 M_sol/L_Bsol at the low end, but
within the range seen in nearby galaxies. The mass-to-light ratios are low
enough to suggest that the galaxies contain a young, rapidly formed stellar
population.
  By using a Toomre stability criterion for formation of spiral structure, we
place constraints on the ratio of M/L to the stellar velocity dispersion. If
these galaxies have maximal disks they would have to be nearly unstable so as
to have small enough velocity dispersions that their disks are not
unrealistically thick. This suggests that there is a substantial amount of dark
matter present in the luminous regions of the galaxy.

consisting of halo, disk, and bulge components combined to produce a flat

because a disk requires less mass than a spherical halo to produce the same
rotation curve---a face-on Mestel disk has a lensing cross section only 41% as
large as a singular isothermal sphere with the same rotation curve. The cross
section is sensitive to inclination and dominated by edge-on galaxies, which
produce lenses with an unobserved 2-image geometry and a smaller number of
standard 5-image lenses. Unless the disk is unreasonably massive, disk+halo
models averaged over inclination predict \lesssim 10% more lenses than pure
halo models. Finally, models with an exponential disk and a central bulge are
sensitive to the properties of the bulge. In particular, an exponential disk
model normalized to our Galaxy cannot produce multiple images without a bulge,
and including a bulge reduces the net flattening of edge-on galaxies. The
dependence of the lensing properties on the masses and shapes of the halo,
disk, and bulge means that a sample of spiral galaxy lenses would provide
useful constraints on galactic structure.

  discussion of limits which can be set using present BATSE data; to be
  published in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/311076",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a general statistical analysis of Gamma Ray Bursts embedded in a
host population. If no host generates more than one observed burst, then we
show that there is a model independent lower bound on the number of hosts, $H$,
of the form $H > c B^2$, where B is the number of observed bursts, and $c$ is a
constant of order one which depends on the confidence level (CL) attached to
the bound. An analysis by Tegmark et al. (1996) shows that the BATSE 3B catalog
of 1122 bursts is consistent with no repeaters being present, and assuming that
this is indeed the case, our result implies a host population with at least
H=1.2x10^6 members. Without the explicit assumption of no repeaters, a Bayesian
analysis based on the results of Tegmark et al. (1996) can be performed which
gives the weaker bound of $H>1.7\times 10^5$ at the 90% CL. In the light of the
non-detection of identifiable hosts in the small error-boxes associated with
transient counterparts to GRBs, this result gives a model independent lower
bound to the number of any rare or exotic hosts. If in fact GRBs are found to
be associated with a particular sub-class of galaxies, then an analysis along
the lines presented here can be used to place a lower bound on the fraction of
galaxies in this sub-class. Another possibility is to treat galaxy clusters
(rather than individual galaxies) as the host population, provided that the
angular size of each cluster considered is less than the resolution of the
detector. Finally, if repeaters are ever detected in a statistically
significant manner, this analysis can be readily adapted to find upper and
lower limits on $H$.

supersymmetric gauge theories, which states that the low-energy physics can be
kept fixed when one changes the ultraviolet cutoff, provided appropriate
changes are made to the bare coupling constants in the Lagrangian. We first
pose a puzzle on how a quantum modified constraint (such as Pf(Q^i Q^j) =
\Lambda^{2(N+1)} in SP(N) theories with N+1 flavors) can be RG invariant, since
the bare fields Q^i receive wave function renormalization when one changes the
ultraviolet cutoff, while we naively regard the scale \Lambda as RG invariant.
The resolution is that \Lambda is not RG invariant if one sticks to canonical
normalization for the bare fields as is conventionally done in field theory. We
derive a formula for how \Lambda must be changed when one changes the
ultraviolet cutoff. We then compare our formula to known exact results and show
that their consistency requires the change in \Lambda we have found. Finally,
we apply our result to models of supersymmetry breaking due to quantum modified
constraints. The RG invariance helps us to determine the effective potential
along the classical flat directions found in these theories. In particular, the
inverted hierarchy mechanism does not occur in the original version of these
models.

nuclei, involving the dynamical interplay of perturbative QCD parton production
and evolution, with non-perturbative parton-cluster formation and `afterburner'
cascading of formed pre-hadronic clusters plus hadron excitations. This
approach allows us to trace the space-time history of parton and hadron degrees
of freedom of nuclear collisions on the microscopical level of parton and
hadron cascades in both position and momentum space, from the instant of
nuclear overlap to the final yield of particles. In applying this approach, we
analyze Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS with beam energy 158 GeV (sqrt{s}/A =
17 GeV) and Au+Au collisions at RHIC with collider energy \sqrt{s}/A = 200 GeV.
We find that the perturbative QCD parton production and cascade development
provides an important contribution to particle production at central
rapidities, and that the `afterburner' cascading of pre-hadronic clusters and
formed hadrons emerging from the parton cascade is essential. The overall
agreement of our model calculations including the `afterburner' cascading with
the observed particle spectra at the CERN SPS is fairly good, whereas the
neglect of the final-state interactions among hadronic excitations deviates
significantly.
