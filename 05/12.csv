that two nearby active galaxies, NGC 1068 and NGC 4258, have a supermassive
object in their nuclei and their masses are nearly comparable; a few 10^7 solar
masses. Nevertheless, the activity of the central engine of NGC 1068 is more
powerful by two orders of magnitude than that of NGC 4258. Since it is
generally considered that the huge luminosities of active galactic nuclei are
attributed to the mass accretion onto a supermassive black hole, the above
observational results suggest that the accretion rate in NGC 1068 is much
higher than that in NGC 4258. Comparing the kinematical properties of the
accreting molecular clouds between NGC 1068 and NGC 4258, we find possible
evidence for dynamical gas accretion in NGC 1068, which may be responsible for
the more powerful central engine in this galaxy.

extends a line of research [Billot and Lang 89, Lang 94] which stresses the

initio quantum dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. Treating
all hydrogen degrees of freedom as dynamical coordinates implies a high
dimensionality and requires statistical averages over thousands of
trajectories. An efficient and accurate treatment of such extensive statistics
is achieved in two steps: In a first step we evaluate the ab initio potential
energy surface (PES) and determine an analytical representation. Then, in an
independent second step dynamical calculations are performed on the analytical
representation of the PES. Thus the dissociation dynamics is investigated
without any crucial assumption except for the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
which is anyhow employed when density-functional theory calculations are
performed. The ab initio molecular dynamics is compared to detailed quantum
dynamical calculations on exactly the same ab initio PES. The occurence of
quantum oscillations in the sticking probability as a function of kinetic
energy is addressed. They turn out to be very sensitive to the symmetry of the
initial conditions. At low kinetic energies sticking is dominated by the
steering effect which is illustrated using classical trajectories. The steering
effects depends on the kinetic energy, but not on the mass of the molecules.
Zero-point effects lead to strong differences between quantum and classical
calculations of the sticking probability. The dependence of the sticking
probability on the angle of incidence is analysed; it is found to be in good
agreement with experimental data. The results show that the determination of
the potential energy surface combined with high-dimensional dynamical
calculations, in which all relevant degrees of freedon are taken into account,
leads to a detailed understanding of the dissociation dynamics of hydrogen at a
transition metal surface.

quark-antiquark production with large transverse momenta in DIS diffractive
dissociation. For the last process we perform extensive numerical calculations

is established. The important role of the spectral function $\chi_4$ of the
four gluon state is pointed out. We relate this function to the twist expansion
of the four gluon amplitude. Motivated by this relation we develop a method to

below 1% at LEP 2 energies at all $W^+W^-$ production angles. A similar
procedure is suggested to incorporate leading bosonic loop effects into
four-fermion production in the fermion-loop scheme. The resulting accuracy
below 1% is sufficient for LEP 2 experiments.

renormalized stress tensor of a quantum field propagating in a (static) curved
background is presented. The starting point of the method is the direct
computation of the functional derivatives of the Euclidean one-loop effective
action with respect to the background metric. This method, when available,
gives rise to a conserved stress tensor and produces the conformal anomaly
formula directly. It is proven that the obtained stress tensor agrees with
statistical mechanics in the case of a finite temperature theory. The
renormalization procedure is controlled by the structure of the poles of the
stress-tensor $\zeta$ function. The infinite renormalization is automatic and
is due to a ``magic'' cancellation of two poles. The remaining finite
renormalization involves conserved geometrical terms arising by a certain
residue. Such terms renormalize coupling constants of the geometric part of
Einstein's equations (customary generalized through high-order curvature
terms). The method is checked on particular cases (closed and open Einstein`s
universe) finding agreement with other approaches. The method is also checked
considering a massless scalar field in the presence of a conical singularity in
the Euclidean manifold (i.e. Rindler spacetimes/large mass black hole
manifold/cosmic string manifold). There, the method gives rise to the stress
tensor already got by the point-splitting approach for every coupling with the
curvature regardless of the presence of the singular curvature. Comments on the
measure employed in the path integral, the use of the optical manifold and
different approaches to renormalize the Hamiltonian are made.

unexpected application of the holomorphy properties of N=2 supersymmetry, and
constitutes a tremendous simplification of the usual computation. An expanded

dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. Various theoretical techniques and
