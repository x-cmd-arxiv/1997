within 500 pc of the Sun leads to the conclusion that the galactic environment
of the Sun changes with time. Consideration of evidence for interstellar gas
interacting with the solar wind implies that these variations may alter the
interplanetary environment of the Earth. The events causing the 10Be spikes
33,000 years and 60,000 years ago in the Antarctic ice record must be
associated with the Local Fluff cloud complex, possibly due to solar encounters
with structures with subparsec scale sizes. An encounter with ""dense""
interstellar cloud material could attenuate the solar L-alpha flux by as much
as 70%, modify mesospheric chemistry, modify the magnetosphere-solar wind
coupling, and alter the global electrical circuit. Prior to the entry of the
Sun into the Local Fluff cloud complex, within the past 200,000 years, the
galactic environment of the Sun differed radically from the environment
prevailing today and expected for the near future.

canonical value of three expected for magnetic dipole radiation, and may have
either sign. The duration of the transition epoch is governed by the slow loss
of angular momentum to radiation and is further prolonged by the reduction in
the moment of inertia caused by the phase change which can even introduce an
era of spin-up. We estimate that about one in a hundred pulsars may be passing
through this phase. The phenomenon is analogous to ``bachbending'' observed in
the moment of inertia of rotating nuclei observed in the 1970's, which also
signaled a change in internal structure with changing spin.

distinct spectral states observed in black hole X-ray binaries: quiescent, low,
intermediate and high states. In the quiescent, low and intermediate states,
the flow consists of an inner hot advection-dominated part extending from the
black hole horizon to a transition radius and an outer thin disk. In the high
state the thin disk is present at all radii. The model is essentially
parameter-free and treats consistently the dynamics of the accretion flow, the
thermal balance of the ions and electrons, and the radiation processes in the
accreting gas. With increasing mass accretion rate, the model goes through a
sequence of stages for which the computed spectra resemble very well
observations of the four spectral states; in particular, the low-to-high state
transition observed in black hole binaries is naturally explained as resulting
from a decrease in the transition radius. We also make a tentative proposal for
the very high state, but this aspect of the model is less secure.
  We test the model against observations of the soft X-ray transient Nova
Muscae during its 1991 outburst. The model reproduces the observed lightcurves
and spectra surprisingly well, and makes a number of predictions which can be
tested with future observations.

masses) crossing the Hertzsprung gap. Usually in such systems the donor's
radius expansion drives a near-Eddington or super-Eddington mass transfer rate
which would sustain a persistently bright accretion disk. We show that GRO
J1655-40 is close to a narrow parameter range where disk instabilities can
occur. This range corresponds to a short-lived evolutionary stage where the
secondary's radius expansion stalls (or reverses), with a correspondingly lower
mass transfer rate. If GRO J1655-40 belongs to this class of transients the
predicted accretion rates imply large populations of luminous persistent and

explain the centrally-brightened X-ray morphology of the supernova remnant
(SNR) W44: (1) a model involving the slow thermal evaporation of clouds
engulfed by a supernova blast wave as it propagates though a clumpy
interstellar medium (ISM), and (2) a hydrodynamical simulation of a blast wave
propagating through a homogeneous ISM, including the effects of radiative
cooling. Both models can have their respective parameters tuned to approximate
the remnant's morphology. The mean temperature of the hot plasma in W44 (~0.9
keV) as determined by our nonequilibrium ionization X-ray spectral analysis
provides the essential key to discriminate between these scenarios. Based on
the size (using the well established distance of 3 kpc) and temperature of W44,
the dynamical evolution predicted by the cloud evaporation model gives an age
for the SNR of merely 6500 yr. We argue that, because this age is inconsistent
with the characteristic age (approx. 20000 yr) of the associated PSR 1853+01,
this model cannot provide the explanation for the center-filled morphology. We
favor the radiative-phase shock model since it can reproduce both the
morphology and age of W44 assuming reasonable values for the initial explosion
energy in the range 0.7E51 to 0.9E51 ergs and the ambient ISM density of
between 3 and 4 cm**-3.

Ly-alpha and Ly-beta. The z_a~z_e line profiles are resolved, with deconvolved
FWHM of 270 to 450 km/s. Lower limits on the total column densities are of
order 10^15 cm-2 for all ions. If the absorber is photoionized by the QSO and
the derived relative columns in C IV and H I are roughly correct, then the
metallicity must be at least solar. The location of the z_a~z_e absorber
remains uncertain. Two ~L_* galaxies in a small cluster centered on PKS
2135-147 lie within 36h^{-1} kpc projected distance and have redshifts
consistent with causing or contributing to the z_a~z_e lines. The extensive
halo of the QSO's host galaxy could also contribute. Calculations show that the
QSO is bright enough to photoionize gas up to O VI in the low-density halos of
the host and nearby cluster galaxies. Nonetheless, there is indirect evidence
for absorption much nearer the QSO, namely (1) the derived high (albeit
uncertain) metallicity, (2) the relatively strong N V absorption lines, which
might be caused by a higher nitrogen abundance in the metal-rich gas, and (3)
strong, lobe-dominated steep-spectrum radio emission, which is known to
correlate with a much higher incidence of (probably intrinsic) z_a~z_e lines.
We propose that the CIV/NV/OVI line ratios can be used as a general diagnostic
of intrinsic versus intervening absorption, as long as the line saturation
effects are understood.

structure on the possibility of ferromagnetism in the single band Hubbard model
is investigated. The d=\infty hypercubic lattice does not show magnetic phase
transitions of second order irrespective of the strength of the Coulomb
coupling. However, first order transitions to finite magnetic moments, not
visible as singularities of the paramagnetic susceptibility, may appear in the
very strong coupling regime. In d=3 second order transitions are found but only
for very strong couplings, where the non-locality of the electronic self-energy
acts in favour of the spontaneous magnetic moment. The influence of the
non-local part of the self-energy is particularly strong for lattices with
small coordination number. The non-bipartite fcc lattice exhibits saturated
ferromagnetism for all band occupations $1\le n\le 2$ while for less than half
filled bands ($0\le n\le 1$) the system remains in any case paramagnetic, and
that for d=3 as well as d=\infty. The Curie temperature runs through a maximum
at about $n=1.4$ and vanishes for $n\to 1$ and $n\to 2$.

$N_\gamma \propto N_{ch}^{1.2}$.
