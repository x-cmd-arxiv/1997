much of the microphysics needed to account for electron-photon and

redistribution of the particles as a result of their Coulomb interaction with
themselves in an arbitrary case. Our goal here is to use a Fokker-Planck
approach in order to develop a fully self-consistent theory for the interaction
of arbitrarily distributed particles and radiation to arrive at an accurate
representation of the high-energy plasma in these sources. We conduct several
tests representative of two dominant segments of parameter space and discuss

analytical forms for the electron distribution in the case of strongly
non-Maxwellian plasmas are given.

integrating two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that allows the development
of velocity anisotropy. We start from the isotropic Plummer model with tidal
cut off and followed the evolution through the corecollapse. The heating by
three-binary is included to obtain the evolution past the corecollapse. The
anisotropy in velocity dispersion develops during the precollapse evolution.
However, the anisotropy becomes highly depressed during the post-collapse
evolution because of rapid loss of radial orbits. Maximum radial anisotropy
appears just after the beginning of the expansion, and degree of anisotropy
decreases slowly as the total mass of the cluster decreases. Thus it may be
possible to determine the evolutionary status of a cluster if the velocity
anisotropy can be measured in the sense that the postcollapse clusters always
have very little degree of anisotropy. The structure of the post-collapse
cluster can be well fitted to King models because the degree of anisotropy is
rather small.

Renormalization-scheme-independent commensurate scale relations are established

processes to other QCD observables such as the heavy quark potential and the
electron-positron annihilation cross section. The commensurate scale relation
connecting the heavy quark potential, as determined from lattice gauge theory,
to the photon-to-pion transition form factor is in excellent agreement with
$\gamma e \to \pi^0 e$ data assuming that the pion distribution amplitude is
close to its asymptotic form $\sqrt{3}f_\pi x(1-x)$. We also reproduce the
scaling and normalization of the $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ data at large
momentum transfer. Because the renormalization scale is small, we argue that
the effective coupling is nearly constant, thus accounting for the nominal
scaling behavior of the data. However, the normalization of the space-like pion
form factor $F_\pi(Q^2)$ obtained from electroproduction experiments is
somewhat higher than that predicted by the corresponding commensurate scale
relation. This discrepancy may be due to systematic errors introduced by the
extrapolation of the $\gamma^* p \to \pi^+ n$ electroproduction data to the
pion pole.
