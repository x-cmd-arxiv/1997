structure, a generalization of the notion of mixed Hodge structure. The utility
of this notion is to make possible a theory of weights for various things
surrounding arbitrary representations of the fundamental group of a smooth
projective variety. We give some examples of generalizations of classical
results for variations of mixed Hodge structure, to the twistor setting. This
supports a ``meta-theorem'' (which we state but don't prove) that one can
everywhere replace the word ``Hodge'' by the word ``twistor''.
  We show that the jet spaces of hyperk\""ahler or more generally hypercomplex
manifolds have natural mixed twistor structures which determine the
hypercomplex structure in a formal neighborhood of a point.

and arises from the curvature of the shell. The amount of curvature comes from
the overall size of the shell so the duration of the decay phase is related to
the time the shell expands before converting its energy to gamma rays. From the
envelope of emission, one can estimate when the central explosion occurred and,
thus, the energy required for the shell to sweep up the ISM. The energy greatly
exceeds 10^{53} erg unless the bulk Lorentz factor is less than 75. This puts

age. The O abundance of the Sgr galaxy deduced from its PN, shows similarities

  ACL/EACL-97",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  We propose a new method of classifying documents into categories. The simple
method of conducting hypothesis testing over word-based distributions in
categories suffers from the data sparseness problem. In order to address this
difficulty, Guthrie et.al. have developed a method using distributions based on
hard clustering of words, i.e., in which a word is assigned to a single cluster
and words in the same cluster are treated uniformly. This method might,
however, degrade classification results, since the distributions it employs are
not always precise enough for representing the differences between categories.
We propose here the use of soft clustering of words, i.e., in which a word can
be assigned to several different clusters and each cluster is characterized by
a specific word probability distribution. We define for each document category
a finite mixture model, which is a linear combination of the probability
distributions of the clusters. We thereby treat the problem of classifying
documents as that of conducting statistical hypothesis testing over finite
mixture models. In order to accomplish this testing, we employ the EM algorithm
which helps efficiently estimate parameters in a finite mixture model.
Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms not only the method
using distributions based on hard clustering, but also the method using
word-based distributions and the method based on cosine-similarity.

constraint logic grammars attempt to address this issue by adding numerical
calculation schemata to the deduction scheme of the underlying CLP framework.
Currently, these extralogical extensions are not related to the model-theoretic
counterpart of the operational semantics of CLP, i.e., they do not come with a
formal semantics at all. The aim of this paper is to present a clear formal
semantics for weighted constraint logic grammars, which abstracts away from
specific interpretations of weights, but nevertheless gives insights into the
parsing problem for such weighted grammars. Building on the formalization of
constraint logic grammars in the CLP scheme of Hoehfeld and Smolka 1988, this
formal semantics will be given by a quantitative version of CLP. Such a
quantitative CLP scheme can also be valuable for CLP tasks independent of

the RG flow in terms of the effective action's interaction function. The
classic derivations of Fermi liquid theory, which apply the Bethe-Salpeter
equation and amount to summing direct particle-hole ladder diagrams, neglect
the zero-angle singularity in the exchange particle-hole loop. As a
consequence, the antisymmetry of the forward scattering vertex is not
guaranteed and the amplitude sum rule must be imposed by hand on the components
of the Landau function. We show that the strong interference of the direct and
exchange processes of particle-hole scattering near zero angle invalidates the
ladder approximation in this region, resulting in temperature-dependent
narrow-angle anomalies in the Landau function and scattering vertex. In this RG
approach the Pauli principle is automatically satisfied. The consequences of

infinite line with particle velocities $v_A=c$ and $v_B=-c$ and initially
segregated conditions, i.e. all A particles to the left and all B particles to
the right of the origin. Previous, models of ballistic annihilation have
particles that always react on contact, i.e. pair-reaction probability $p=1$.
The evolution of such systems are wholly determined by the initial distribution
of particles and therefore do not have a stochastic dynamics. However, in this
paper the generalisation is made to $p<1$, allowing particles to pass through
each other without necessarily reacting. In this way, the A and B particle
domains overlap to form a fluctuating, finite-sized reaction zone where the
product C is created. Fluctuations are also included in the currents of A and B
particles entering the overlap region, thereby inducing a stochastic motion of
the reaction zone as a whole. These two types of fluctuations, in the reactions
and particle currents, are characterised by the `intrinsic reaction rate', seen
in a single system, and the `extrinsic reaction rate', seen in an average over
many systems. The intrinsic and extrinsic behaviours are examined and compared
to the case of isotropically diffusing reactants.

of bubbles, vortex-antivortex pairs produced via the new mechanism have
overlapping configurations, and annihilate quickly; so only those vortices
survive till late which are produced via the Kibble mechanism. However, for low
nucleation rates, bubble collisions are energetic enough to lead to many well
separated vortex-antivortex pairs being produced via the new mechanism. For
example, in a simulation involving nucleation of 20 bubbles, a total of 14
non-overlapping vortices and antivortices formed via this new mechanism of pair
creation (6 of them being very well separated), as compared to 6 vortices and
antivortices produced via the Kibble mechanism. Our results show the

Given a bihomogeneous polynomial $f$ of several complex variables that is
positive away from the origin, we proved that there is an integer $d$ so that
$||z||^{2d} f(z,{\overline z})$ is the squared norm of a holomorphic mapping.
Thus, although $f$ may not itself be a squared norm, it must be the quotient of
squared norms of holomorphic homogeneous polynomial mappings. The proof
required some operator theory on the unit ball. In the present paper we prove
that we can replace the squared Euclidean norm by squared norms arising from an
orthonormal basis for the space of homogeneous polynomials on any bounded
circled pseudoconvex domain of finite type. To do so we prove a compactness
result for an integral operator on such domains related to the Bergman kernel
function.
