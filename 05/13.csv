new extension of Schwarzschild's orbit superposition approach. Models are
constructed for inclinations of 90 and 55 degrees. No model without a nuclear
dark object can fit the combined ground-based and HST data, independent of the
dynamical structure of M32. Models with a nuclear dark object of 3.4 x 10^6
solar masses do provide an excellent fit. The inclined models provide the best
fit, but the inferred dark mass does not depend sensitively on the assumed
inclination. The models that best fit the data are not two-integral models, but
like two-integral models they are azimuthally anisotropic. An extended dark
object can fit the data only if its half-mass radius is r_h < 0.08 arcsec
(=0.26 pc), implying a central dark matter density exceeding 1 x 10^8 solar
masses / pc^3. This density is high enough to rule out most plausible
alternatives to a massive black hole. The dynamically inferred dark mass is
identical to that suggested by existing adiabatic black hole growth models for
HST photometry of M32. The low activity of M32 implies either that only a very
small fraction of the gas that is shed by evolving stars is accreted onto the
black hole, or that accretion proceeds at very low efficiency, e.g. in an
advection-dominated mode. (shortened version)

be matched to the observed one in NGC4151, if the narrow line clouds see a more

either narrow-band emission-line searches, or by Lyman limit searches (both
techniques which have been highlighted at this meeting) simply because such
selection methods rely on the presence of a strong ultraviolet component.
Selection on the basis of extreme radio power has also proved to yield
optically active objects with the majority of high-redshift objects studied to
date displaying complex elongated optical/UV morphologies, relatively blue
optical-ultraviolet continuum colours, and strong emission lines. These
features, coupled with the failure to detect any spectral signatures of old
stars at $z > 1$, has led to the suggestion that these galaxies are being
observed close to or even during a general epoch of formation. However, we have
recently demonstrated that radio selection at significantly fainter (mJy) flux
densities can be used to identify apparently passively evolving elliptical
galaxies at high redshift. Deep Keck spectra have now been obtained for two
such objects yielding absorption line redshifts $z \simeq 1.5$; 53W091 at $z =
1.552$ (Dunlop et al. 1996) and most recently 53W069 at $z = 1.432$. The
ultraviolet SEDs of these galaxies indicate minimum ages $> 3$ Gyr while, as
stressed in this article, the strength of the reddenning-independent
ultraviolet spectral breaks actually indicate a greater minimum age of 5 Gyr
for both objects assuming solar metallicity. Since the spectra comprise the
integrated light of each galaxy to radii greater than $r_e$, I argue that it is
difficult to justify the adoption of significantly super-solar metallicity in
interpreting these data. It thus seems hard to escape the conclusion that
$\Omega_0 < 1$ and that, irrespective of the adopted cosmology, at least some
massive ellipitical galaxies were formed at high redshift ($z> 5$).

completed as an ESO Key-Project over ~23 square degrees, in a region near the
South Galactic Pole. The survey is nearly complete to the limiting magnitude
b_J=19.4 and consists of 3342 galaxies with reliable redshift determination.
The ESP survey is intermediate between shallow, wide angle samples and very
deep, one-dimensional pencil beams: spanning a volume of ~ 5 x 10^4 Mpc^3 at
the sensitivity peak (z ~ 0.1), it provides an accurate determination of the
""local"" luminosity function and the mean galaxy density. We find that, although
a Schechter function is an acceptable representation of the luminosity function
over the entire range of magnitudes (M < -12.4), our data suggest the presence
of a steepening of the luminosity function for M > -17. The amplitude and the
alpha and M^* parameters of our luminosity function are in good agreement with
those of the AUTOFIB redshift survey (Ellis et al. 1996). Viceversa, our
amplitude is significantly higher, by a factor ~ 1.6 at M ~ M^*, than that
found for both the Stromlo-APM (Loveday et al. 1992) and the Las Campanas (Lin
et al. 1996) redshift surveys. Also the faint end slope of our luminosity
function is significantly steeper than that found in these two surveys.
  Large over- and under- densities are clearly seen in our data. In particular,
we find evidence for a ""local"" underdensity (for D < 140 Mpc) and a significant
overdensity at z ~ 0.1. When these radial density variations are taken into
account, our derived luminosity function reproduces very well the observed
counts for b_J < 19.4, including the steeper than Euclidean slope for b_J < 17.

Final version published in Gravitation and Cosmology","Grav.Cosmol. 4 (1998) 257",,,"gr-qc",,"  In the Ashtekar and geometrodynamic formulations of vacuum general
relativity, the Euclidean and Lorentzian sectors can be related by means of the
generalized Wick transform discovered by Thiemann. For some vacuum
gravitational systems in which there exists an intrinsic time variable which is
not invariant under constant rescalings of the metric, we show that, after such
a choice of time gauge and with a certain identification of parameters, the
generalized Wick transform can be understood as an analytic continuation in the
explicit time dependence. This result is rigorously proved for the Gowdy model
with the topology of a three-torus and for a whole class of cosmological models
that describe expanding universes. In these gravitational systems, the analytic
continuation that reproduces the generalized Wick transform after gauge fixing
turns out to map the Euclidean line element to the Lorentzian one multiplied by
an imaginary factor; this transformation rule differs from that expected for an
inverse Wick rotation in a complex rescaling of the four-metric. We then prove
that this transformation rule for the line element continues to be valid in the
most general case of vacuum gravity with no model reduction nor gauge fixing.
In this general case, it is further shown that the action of the generalized
Wick transform on any function of the gravitational phase space variables, the
shift vector, and the lapse function can in fact be interpreted as the result
of an inverse Wick rotation and a constant, imaginary conformal transformation.

first review the LHC sensitivity to those two chiral parameters (in the hardest

predict the general resonance spectrum of the strongly interacting symmetry
breaking sector. For that purpose, we use the inverse amplitude method which is
also very successful reproducing the lightest hadronic resonances from data in

combinatorial cardinals b and d. Reclaw gave topological meaning to the
definition of the cardinal p. We extend the picture with a topological
interpretation of the cardinal t. We compare our notion to the one related to
p, and to some other classical notions. This sheds new light on the famous open
problem whether p=t.

intermediate energy heavy ion reactions. We define locally thermodynamic
variables, i.e. density, pressure and temperature, directly from the phase
space distribution of a relativistic transport calculation. In particular,
temperatures are determined by a fit to two covariant hot Fermi distributions
thus taking into account possible anisotropic momentum configurations. We
define instability independent from the nuclear matter spinodal by the
criterion that the effective compressibility becomes negative. The method is
applied to a semi-central Au on Au reaction at 600 MeV/nucleon. We investigate
in particular the center of the participant and the spectator matter. In the
latter we find a clear indication of instability with conditions of density and
temperature that are consistent with experimental determinations.

approach of constructing complicated logical operations from many simple gates
inappropriate. Instead, we propose to design multi-spin quantum gates in which
the input and output two-state systems (spins) are not necessarily identical.
We outline the design criteria for such devices and then review recent results
for single-unit Hamiltonians that accomplish the NOT and XOR functions.
