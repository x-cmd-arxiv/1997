modelling the evolution of globular clusters driven by relaxation,stellar
evolution,disk shocking and including the effects of the tidal field of the
Galaxy. We investigate the evolution of multi-mass models with a power-law
initial mass function (IMF) starting with different initial masses,
concentrations, slopes of the IMF and located at different galactocentric
distances. We show to what extent the effects of the various evolutionary
processes alter the shape of the IMF and to what extent these changes depend on
the position of the cluster in the Galaxy. Both the changes in the global mass
function and in the local one (measured at different distances from the cluster
center) are investigated showing whether and where the local mass function
keeps memory of the IMF and where it provides a good indication of the current
global mass function. The evolution of the population of white dwarfs is also
followed in detail and we supply an estimate of the fraction of the current
value of the total mass expected to be in white dwarfs depending on the main
initial conditions for the cluster (mass and position in the Galaxy).Simple
analytical expression by which it is possible to calculate the main quantities
of interest (total mass, fraction of white dwarfs, slope of the mass function)
at any time t for a larger number of different initial conditions than those
investigated numerically have been derived.

such systems, review the methods allowing to treat them, emphasize the shift of
viewpoint compared to the physics of manifolds and discuss their physics in
detail. As for the statics, periodicity helps the system to retain a
quasi-translational order and to be stable with respect to the proliferation of
free topological defects such as dislocations. A disordered periodic system
thus leads to a glass phase with Bragg peaks: the Bragg glass. On the other
hand, for driven lattices, transverse periodicity allows the system to retain
its glassy nature, leading to a moving glass phase. The existence of these two
phases has important theoretical and experimental consequences, in particular
for vortex physics in superconductors, the physical system which is mainly
focused here.

evaporating black hole geometries cannot be foliated by a non-singular family

Although complete information may not be available on every spacelike surface,
information is not lost in a spacetime sense in an evaporating black hole
spacetime. Rather complete information is distributed about the
four-dimensional spacetime. Black hole evaporation is thus not in conflict with
the principles of quantum mechanics when suitably generally stated. (Talk

  The Universal Gravitational Constant G With Time","24 pages, Tex file",,,"Bhubaneswar preprint IP/BBSR/97-14","gr-qc",,"  Considering the fact that the present universe might have been formed out of
a system of ficticious self-gravitating particles, fermionic in nature, each of
mass $m$, we are able to obtain a compact expression for the radius $R_0$ of
the universe by using a model density distribution $\rho (r)$ for the particles
which is singular at the origin. This singularity in $\rho (r)$ can be
considered to be consistent with the socalled Big Bang theory of the universe.
By assuming that Mach's principle holds good in the evolution of the universe,
we determine the number of particles, $N$, of the universe and its $R_0$, which
are obtained in terms of the mass $m$ of the constituent particles and the
Universal Gravitational constant $G$ only. It is seen that for a mass of the
constituent particles $m\simeq 1.07\times 10^{-35} g$ the age of the present
universe,$\tau_0$, becomes $\tau_0 \simeq 20\times 10^9 yr$, or equivalently
$R_0 \simeq 1.9\times 10^{28} cm $. For this $m$, the total number of particles
costituting the present universe is found to be $N \simeq 2.4 \times 10^{91}$
and its total mass $(M \simeq 1.27916 \times 10^{23} M_{\odot})$, $M_{\odot}$
being the solar mass. All these numbers seem to be quantitatively agreeing with
those evaluated from other theories. Using the present theory, we have also
made an estimation of the variation of the universal gravitational constant $G$
with time which gives $({\dot G \over G}) =-9.6\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$. This
is again in extremely good agreement with the results of some of the most
recent calculations. Lastly, a plausible explanation for the Dark Matter
present in today's universe is given.

sensitivity to the kinematics of soft gluon radiation and to the difference
between partonic and hadronic phase space. We show how these large corrections
can be resummed giving the dominant contribution to the cross section. The
resummation leads to the introduction of non-perturbative, universal
distribution functions. We discuss the importance of these shape functions for

analyse the implications of the presence of such a signal in models of new

charged current signal is absent. As a consequence if this signal is present
the resulting indications are very selective. In particular for squarks only
charged current events with multi-quark final states are possible with quite
definite predictions on the spectrum of supersymmetric particles.
