A* is that black hole or it orbits the black hole with a radius less than 3 AU.
Second, even if the star cluster does not contain a massive black hole, Sgr A*
is constrained to move slower than 20 kms (1 sigma) relative to the center of
mass of the cluster. The Galactocentric distance is therefore R_0=7.5 +/- 0.7

substantially reduced by future observations. If they are, it will also be
possible to probe the motion of the nuclear star cluster relative to the center

double-peaked H-alpha line was stronger than the blue, while by 1994 the
H-alpha profile had become almost symmetric and the integrated line flux had
decreased to half its original value. Our new spectrum, taken in 1996, shows
that the broad, double-peaked lines have returned to almost their original
strengths, the profiles of H-beta and H-alpha are identical to within errors,
and the broad-line emitting region is unreddened. However, the profile of the
Balmer lines is now such that the blue peak is stronger than the red, opposite
to the asymmetry observed in 1991. Various models are considered for the
observed behavior, all assuming that the emission lines originate in an
accretion disk. We present a refined version of the precessing, planar,
elliptical accretion ring model proposed by Storchi-Bergmann et al. and
Eracleous et al. This model provides an acceptable fit to the line profiles. We
also consider the possibility that the line profile evolution results from a
precessing warp in the disk, induced by irradiation from the center, and show
that the range of radii and precession time scales expected in this model are
consistent with the observations. The sudden appearance of the ""disk-like""
broad line profiles in NGC 1097 could have resulted from the formation of a new
accretion disk due to, for example, the tidal disruption of a star, or the
illumination of a pre-existing disk by a transient ionizing source at the
center of the disk.

used to investigate the $(H,T)$-phase diagram in uniaxial anisotropic high-
$T_c$ superconductors, both in zero magnetic field and in intermediate magnetic
fields for various mass-anisotropies. The model we consider is the uniformly
frustrated anisotropic Villain Model. In zero magnetic field, and for all
anisotropies considered, we find one single second order phase transition,
mediated by an Onsager vortex-loop blowout. This is the superconductor-normal
metal transition.A comparison with numerical simulations and a critical scaling
analysis of the zero-field loop-transition yields the same exponent of the loop
distribution function at the critical point. In the intermediate magnetic field
regime, we find two anomalies in the specific heat. The first anomaly at a
temperature $T_m$ is associated with the melting transition of the flux-line
lattice. The second anomaly at a temperature $T_z$ is one where phase coherence
along the field direction is destroyed. We argue that $T_m=T_z$ in the
thermodynamic and continuum limit. Hence, there is no regime where the flux
line lattice melts into a disentangled flux-line liquid. The loss of phase
coherence parallel to the magnetic field in the sample is argued to be due to
the proliferation of closed non-field induced vortex loops on the scale of the
magnetic length in the problem, resulting in flux-line cutting and
recombination. In the flux-line liquid phase, therefore, flux-lines appear no
longer to be well defined entities. A finite-size scaling analysis of the delta
function peak specific heat anomaly at the melting transition is used to
extract the discontinuity of the entropy at the melting transition.This entropy
discontinuity is found to increase rapidly with mass-anisotropy.

compelling so far, several are about as good as they can be with present
errors. Most important, all pieces of evidence imply the same values for common
parameters --- a necessary condition, and one unlikely to hold if the hints
from data are misleading. The parameters are sparticle or soft-breaking masses
and $ tan \beta.$ For the parameter ranges reported here, there are so far no
signals that should have occurred but did not. Given those parameters a number
of predictions can test whether the evidence is real. It turns out that the
predictions are mostly different from the conventional supersymmetry ones, and
might have been difficult to recognize as signals of superpartners. They are
testable at LEP2, where neutralinos and charginos will appear mainly as
$\gamma\gamma +$ large $\slashchar{E}$ events, $\gamma +$ very large
$\slashchar{E}$ events, and very soft lepton pairs of same or mixed flavor. The
results demonstrate that we understand a lot about how to extract an effective
SUSY Lagrangian from limited data, and that we can reasonably hope to learn
about the theory near the Planck scale from the data at the electroweak scale.

there are new candidates for the inflaton. We present a simple model for
slow-rollover inflation where the vacuum energy driving inflation is related to
the same F-term responsible for the spectrum of supersymmetric particles in
gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models. The inflaton is identified with
field responsible for the generation of the $\mu$-term\. This opens the

the simple exponential law $\rho(\xi)=exp(-\xi)$ ($\xi$ is the deviation of the

between the expected and actual probabilities grows with $\xi$ very rapidly,
amounting to $ 10^7 $ at $\xi\approx 6 $, and is significant even at $\xi=2 $.
A more detailed study reveals the two-component structure of the distribution:
the $exp(-\xi)$ law is closely fulfilled up to $\xi=3$, but then, at $\xi$
larger than that, the decrease is retarded drastically. This behaviour can be
associated with the existence of two various types of systematic errors, the
detected and undetected ones. Within some model, both types of errors are seen
to affect the form of the distribution, one at moderate $\xi$ and the other at
large $\xi$. The first type (detected) errors are shown in some natural-looking

drop with limited size in the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics. In the
presence of the boundary, the expanding and cooling of QGP drop may appear as
oscillating processes, which realize via multiple traveling of rarefaction and
compression waves through the plasma and lead to increasing of plasma
life-time. Within this picture, deflagration is the main possible way of
hadronization. The slow cooling mechanism also leads to a significant
enhancement of photon yield in comparison with Bjorken scenario.

by an optimization process in a rugged fitness landscape and die due to their

derive the $t^{-2}$ law which characterizes the life time distribution of
biological genera. Thirdly we discuss other dynamical properties of the model
such as the rate of extinction and conclude with a brief discussion.

dimensional vertical cavity surface emitting laser (vcsel) arrays is
introduced. It is shown that the theory includes both the previous theory for
edge emitting semiconductor laser arrays and the theory of polarization
dynamics in single quantum well vcsels in a single unified description. The
model is based on the physical assumption of separate carrier density pools
individually coupled to different light field modes. These modes interact
through the coherent light field dynamics derived from Maxwell's equations. The
special case of two densities and two light field modes is solved and the
implications for larger arrays are discussed. Our analytic results show that
typical solutions of the split density model range from phase locking to chaos,
depending on the magnitude of the coherent interaction. For weak coupling the
stable supermode is always the mode of highest frequency. This indicates that
anti-phase locking is the only stable phase locking possible in semiconductor
laser arrays.

process of cloning. The optimal universal cloners permit us to derive a new
upper bound on the quantum capacity of the depolarizing quantum channel.

interpretation, we discuss the structure of the stochastic process associated

quantum counterparts. An interesting phenomenon discovered in this connection
is the scar effect, whereby energy eigenstates display enhancement structures
resembling the path of unstable periodic orbits. This paper deals with
collision states in charged three-body problems, in periodic media, which are
scarred by unstable classical orbits. The scar effect has a potential for
practical applications because orbits corresponding to zero measure classical
configurations may be reached and stabilized by resonant excitation. It may be
used, for example, to induce reactions that are favoured by unstable
configurations.
