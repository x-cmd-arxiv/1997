particular, we use invariants arising in the Todd class of a toric variety to
give a new explicit formula for the values of the zeta function of a real

resolved continuum structure around all of our quasars in the WFPC2 images and
in four of the five ground-based K' images. All of the quasars have some
optical continuum structure that is aligned with the radio axis. In 3 of these
cases, some of this optical structure is most likely due to optical synchrotron
radiation, including optical counterparts to two radio jets and one radio lobe.
Two quasars have aligned continuum and emission-line structures that are
probably not due to beamed optical synchrotron emission. In another quasar, we
see a red aligned object that lies 3 arcsec beyond the radio lobe, and may be
an unassociated foreground galaxy, but has a remarkable morphological
resemblance to the radio lobe itself. The radio galaxies and the quasars in
this small sample have similar incidence of alignment, and the optical and K'
flux densities are consistent within the high dispersion. The average quasar
host galaxy luminosity is equivalent to, or a little fainter than, L*. All
components around the quasars have optical-infrared colors that are redder than
or similar to the colors of their respective nuclei; this is generally more
consistent with a stellar rather than scattered origin for the emission. This
study provides qualitative support for the unification of FRII quasars and

counterpart appears to be embedded in an extended source which, if a galaxy as
has been suggested, would lend weight to those models that place GRBs at
cosmological distances. Here we report the observations using the Hubble Space

the initial gamma-ray outburst. We find that the counterpart has faded since
the initial detection (and continues to fade), but the extended source exhibits
no significant change in brightness between the two dates of observations
reported here. The size and apparent constancy between the two epochs of HST
observations imply that it is extragalactic, but its faintness makes a
definitive statement about its nature difficult. Nevertheless, the decay
profile of the transient source is consistent with a popular impulsive-fireball
model, which assumes a merger between two neutron stars in a distant galaxy.

on the observed cluster and galaxy correlations (Wu, et al. 1996). It appears
very unlikely that uncertainties in the modeling of the gravitational lensing

mechanisms other than the magnification bias.

long perturbation wavelength case but can not be ignored in the short
wavelength case. It becomes significant in an optically thin, radiative cooling
dominated disk when the perturbation wavelength is shorter than 15H (H is the
scale height of disk) and in a geometrically thin, optically thick and
radiation pressure dominated disk when the perturbation wavelength is shorter
than 50H. In an optically thick, advection-dominated disk, which is thermally
unstable against short wavelength perturbations, the relative surface density
change is much larger. We proved the positive correlation between the changes
of surface density and temperature in an optically thick, advection- dominated

simple assumptions, we derive expressions for the magnetization obtained in the
usual ZFC, FC, TRM procedures. We point out that the ZFC-peak position is
extremely sensitive to the width of the particle size distribution, and give
some numerical estimates of this effect. We propose to combine the FC
magnetization with a modified TRM measurement, a procedure which allows a more
direct access to the barrier distribution in a field. The typical barrier
values which are obtained with this method show a monotonic decrease for
increasing fields, as expected from the simple effect of anisotropy barrier
lowering, in contrast with the ZFC results. From our measurements on
gamma-Fe2O3 particles, we show that the width of the effective barrier
distribution is slightly increasing with the field, an effect which is
sufficient for causing the observed initial increase of the ZFC-peak
temperatures.

equations which are a coupled set of equations for deformations of the

possible for a non-conserved system such that internal motion of each domain is
adiabatically eliminated. The resulting equation of motion contains only the
displacement of the center of gravity of domains, which is equivalent to the
phase variable of a periodic structure. Thus our formulation automatically
includes the phase dynamics of layered structures. In a conserved system and a
binary fluid, however, the internal motion of domains turns out to be a slow
variable in the long wavelength limit because of concentration conservation.
Therefore a reduced description only involving the phase variable is not
generally justified.

Three theoretical lower bounds on parameter estimation accuracy are considered:
the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB); the Weiss-Weinstein bound (WWB); and the Ziv-Zakai
bound (ZZB). We obtain the WWB and ZZB for the Newtonian-form of the coalescing
binary waveform, and compare them with published CRB and numerical Monte-Carlo

and are attained by the Monte-Carlo results. As SNR gradually drops below 10,
the WWB and ZZB are both found to provide increasingly tighter lower bounds
than the CRB. However, at these levels of moderate SNR, there is a significant
departure between all the bounds and the numerical Monte-Carlo results.

relativistic brane models, of the category that includes point particle,
string, and membrane representations for phenomena that can be considered as
being confined to a worldsheet of the corresponding dimension (respectively
one, two, and three) in a thin limit approximation. The first part of the
course is concerned with purely kinematic aspects: it is shown how, to second
differential order, the geometry (and in particular the inner and outer
curvature) of a brane worldsheet of arbitrary dimension is describable in terms
of the first, second, and third fundamental tensor; the extension to a
foliation by a congruence of such worldsheets is also briefly discussed. In the
next part, it is shown how -- to lowest order in the thin limit -- the
evolution of such a brane worldsheet will always be governed by a simple
tensorial equation of motion whose left hand side is the contraction of the
second fundamental tensor with the relevant surface stress tensor, while the
right hand side will simply vanish in the case of free motion and will
otherwise be just the orthogonal projection of any external force density that
may happen to act on the brane. (Allowance for first order deviations from such
a thin limit treatment would require evolution equations of a more complicated
kind of which a prototype example is presented.) The last part of the course
concentrates on the case of a string, and particularly on the stationary
(centrifugally supported) configurations known as vortons, which, if they are
sufficiently stable, may be of considerable cosmological significance.
