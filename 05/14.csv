from ZAMS masses in the range 10 to $20 \Msun$ --- by means of linear and
non-linear calculations. We find period and growth rate of the dominant
fundamental mode to increase with increasing luminosity-to-mass ratio $L/M$.
Our models obtain relatively large $L/M$ values due to the inclusion of
rotation in the evolutionary calculations; however, the largest values are
obtained at and beyond central He-exhaustion due to major internal
rearrangements of the nuclear burning regions. Our non-linear calculations as
well as the behavior of the linear period and growth rate of the pulsations for
periods approaching the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale of the H-rich stellar
envelope point towards the possibility of large amplitude pulsations. Such
properties are similar to that found in AGB stars and suggest the possibility
of a ``superwind'' to occur before the RSGs explode as supernovae. We conclude
that changes in global stellar properties during the last few $10^4 \yr$ before
core collapse may lead to drastic changes in the pulsational and wind
properties of pre-supernova stars, with marked consequences for the immediate
pre-supernova structure of the star and the circumstellar medium. We compare
our results with observations of long-period OH/IR variables and discuss
observational evidence for our scenario from observed supernova light curves,
spectra and remnants.

spatially coincident with a host galaxy--in many cosmological models the
progenitors are ejected to large distances from their parent galaxies. While
the optical transient of GRB 970228 may be close to a faint galaxy, there are
several other galaxies in the field which could be the host if the progenitors
are ejected to ~50 kpc. If GRBs come from such a widely distributed progenitor
population then it should be possible to search for a statistical correlation
between optical transients and nearby galaxies. We provide a statistical
framework for quantifying a correlation between potential host galaxies and
GRBs, taking into account that galaxies are clustered. From simulations, we
estimate that if GRBs occur within l < 100 kpc of their host, then optical
observations B < 24.0 of the galaxy field near just 6 optical transient
positions are required to find a correlation with potential hosts at the 95
percent confidence level. The methodology constructed herein is extendible to
any cross-correlation analysis and is especially useful if either set of
objects is clustered. Ultimately, if the distance scale to GRBs is established
as cosmological, this analysis can be used to determine the spatial
distribution of GRBs near their host galaxies.

of optically-selected clusters taken from the catalogue of Couch et al (1991).
Previous ROSAT observations of these clusters have shown them to have lower
X-ray luminosities, given their optical richness, than might be expected on the
basis of local samples. In the present paper we extend this work by determining
velocity dispersions of a subsample of the clusters. We confirm the dynamical
reality of all but one of the original sample, and find velocity dispersions
comparable with present-day clusters of equivalent comoving space density.
Thus, in the context of the $L_X-\sigma$ relation for present-day clusters,
there is evidence for a higher velocity dispersion at fixed X-ray luminosity.
  A key question is whether the high velocity dispersions are indicative of the
gravitational potential. If they are, the X-ray luminosities measured in Bower
et al., 1994 (Paper I), would then imply an implausibly low efficiency of X-ray
generation. Alternatively, the discrepancy could be explained if the clusters
were systems of lower virial temperature, in which the apparent velocity
dispersion is inflated by an infalling, unrelaxed halo. This might result
either from an increase with redshift in the infall rate for clusters, or from
the preferential selection of clusters embedded in filaments oriented along the
line of sight. Since clusters with similar properties can be found in local
optically selected catalogues, we suggest that the latter explanation is more
likely.

spectrum. The maximum number g_N of consecutive levels exhibiting the universal
Wigner-Dyson rigidity (the Thouless number) is given as a function of the
strength U of the interaction for the bulk of the spectrum. In the dilute
limit, one finds two thresholds: When U<U_{c1}, there is a perturbative mixing
between a few Slater determinants (Rabi oscillations) and g_N \propto |U|^P <1,
where P=N/2 (even N) or (N+1)/2 (odd N). When U=U_{c1}, the level spacing
distribution exhibits a crossover from Poisson to Wigner, related to the
crossover between weak perturbative mixing and effective golden-rule decay, and
g_N \approx 1. Moreover, we show that the same U_{c1} signifies also the
breakdown of the perturbation theory in U. For U_{c1}<U<U_{c2}, the states are
extended over the energetically nearby Slater determinants with a non-ergodic
hierarchical structure related to the sparse form of the Hamiltonian. Above a
second threshold U_{c2}, the sparsity becomes irrelevant, and the states are
extended more or less ergodically over g_N consecutive Slater determinants. A
self-consistent argument gives g_N ~ U^{N/(N-1)}. We compare our predictions to
a numerical study of three spinless Fermions in a disordered cubic lattice.
Implications for the interaction-induced N-particle delocalization in real
space are discussed. The applicability of Fermi's golden rule for decay in this

the exponential of minus a fractional power of the argument, are commonly found
in turbulence and other areas. They can arise because of an underlying random
multiplicative process. For this, a theory of extreme deviations is developed,
devoted to the far tail of the pdf of the sum $X$ of a finite number $n$ of
independent random variables with a common pdf $e^{-f(x)}$. The function $f(x)$
is chosen (i) such that the pdf is normalized and (ii) with a strong convexity
condition that $f''(x)>0$ and that $x^2f''(x)\to +\infty$ for $|x|\to\infty$.
Additional technical conditions ensure the control of the variations of
$f''(x)$. The tail behavior of the sum comes then mostly from individual
variables in the sum all close to $X/n$ and the tail of the pdf is $\sim
e^{-nf(X/n)}$. This theory is then applied to products of independent random
variables, such that their logarithms are in the above class, yielding usually
stretched exponential tails. An application to fragmentation is developed and
compared to data from fault gouges. The pdf by mass is obtained as a weighted
superposition of stretched exponentials, reflecting the coexistence of
different fragmentation generations. For sizes near and above the peak size,
the pdf is approximately log-normal, while it is a power law for the smaller
fragments, with an exponent which is a decreasing function of the peak fragment
size. The anomalous relaxation of glasses can also be rationalized using our
result together with a simple multiplicative model of local atom
configurations. Finally, we indicate the possible relevance to the distribution
of small-scale velocity increments in turbulent flow.

is described by a 12-parameter Lagrangian encompassing a Hilbert-Einstein term,

is built up from Weyl's segmental curvature. Matter is represented by a
hyperfluid, a continuous medium the elements of which possess classical
momentum and hypermomentum. With the help of irreducible decompositions, we are
able to express torsion and traceless nonmetricity explicitly in terms of the
spin and the shear current of the hyperfluid. Thereby the field equations
reduce to an effective Einstein theory describing a metric coupled to the Weyl
1-form (a Proca-type vector field) and to a spin fluid. We demonstrate that a
triplet of torsion and nonmetricity 1-forms describes the general and unique
vacuum solution of the field equations of MAG. Finally, we study homogeneous
cosmologies with an hyperfluid. We find that the hypermomentum affects
significantly the cosmological evolution at very early stages. However, unlike

duality (including Buscher's) has an O(1,2) action on them and S duality a U(1)

one representations while the other representation (which includes the angular
momentum) never appears in it. The bound is manifestly duality-invariant.
Consistency between T duality and supersymmetry requires that primary scalar
hair is included in the Bogomol'nyi bound. Four-dimensional supersymmetric
massless black holes are the T duals in time of massive supersymmetric black
holes. Non-extreme massless ``black holes'' are the T duals of the non-extreme

transformed into a system of quasiparticles. It is also assumed for simplicity
that there is in average N fluxes per particle. If the number N of fluxes is
even, then the system can be identified as composite fermions. If N is odd,
then we obtain composite bosons. Quantization is described as gradation by
certain abelian group G. Statistics is determined by a commutation factor on
the grading group G. It is schown that for N = 2 there is a state for which the
magnetic field is completely compensatad by the system of quasiparticles and
for N = 3 the Landau levells are fractionally filled like in the fractional

the new position \tilde{x} conjugate to the winding mode, in addition to the
position x conjugate to the momentum mode. In this way they can describe a
universe larger than the string scale with the coordinate x and one smaller
with the coordinate \tilde{x}. Resultingly, they never encounter the
singularity seen in the standard Big Bang scenario. The most interesting
phenomenon in this model is the transition from \tilde{x}-space to x-space when
the size of universe is nearly the string scale. Here, we define the dispersion
of the momentum number m times the winding number w as the `correlation' of
momentum modes and winding modes. Then using the statistical mechanics of
strings on a torus, we calculate the correlation in low and high temperature
limits, and we consider the possibility that we can observe this effect today,
but we will see that this is unlikely.

modification due to massive strings and did not explain how to carry

present a possible, intuitive model for the time development of a black hole in

first order phase transition occurs near the Hagedorn temperature and the
string gas changes to hypothetical matter with vanishing entropy and energy
