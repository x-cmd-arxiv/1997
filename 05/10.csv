  Plain Tex, uses mn.tex, 7 pages. Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/289.4.882",,"astro-ph",,"  We address the question of the occurrence of star formation bursts in the
solar neighbourhood by using the metallicity distribution of the G dwarfs. We
present a method to recover the star formation history using simultaneously the
metallicity distribution and the age-metallicity relation. The method
associates the number of stars in a given metallicity interval with the
corresponding time interval predicted by the age-metallicity relation. We take
into account corrections relative to observational errors, cosmic scatter and
scale height effects. The method is tested by simulations of the chemical
evolution of a galaxy with irregular star formation rate, and our results show
that it is possible to recover the star formation history fairly well. The
application of the method to the solar neighbourhood shows evidences for at
least two strong events of star formation: a burst 8 Gyr ago, and a lull 2-3
Gyr ago. These features confirm some previous studies on the star formation
history in the local disk.

Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/304908",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the form of the momentum distribution function for protons and
electrons in an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We show that for all
accretion rates, Coulomb collisions are too inefficient to thermalize the
protons. The proton distribution function is therefore determined by the
viscous heating mechanism, which is unknown. The electrons, however, can
exchange energy quite efficiently through Coulomb collisions and the emission
and absorption of synchrotron photons. We find that for accretion rates greater
than \sim 10^{-3} of the Eddington accretion rate, the electrons have a thermal
distribution throughout the accretion flow. For lower accretion rates, the
electron distribution function is determined by the electron's source of
heating, which is primarily adiabatic compression. Using the principle of
adiabatic invariance, we show that an adiabatically compressed collisionless
gas maintains a thermal distribution until the particle energies become
relativistic. We derive a new, non-thermal, distribution function which arises
for relativistic energies and provide analytic formulae for the synchrotron
radiation from this distribution. Finally, we discuss its implications for the
emission spectra from ADAFs.

has a redshift of z=0.8384 (Lehnert & Becker 1997) and its optical-infrared
colors (Lehnert et al. 1997) are consistent with a late-type spiral galaxy at
this redshift with a luminosity of about 2L*. This object is likely the galaxy
responsible for the strongest MgII absorption line system seen in the spectrum
of 4C+09.17 by Barthel et al. (1990). Redshifts are not available for the
remaining two companions. The red colors of the second brightest companion
appear most consistent with a high redshift star-forming galaxy at z > 1.5. If
this object is at the redshift of 4C +09.17 it has a luminosity of about 7L*.
The faintest companion has colors which are unlike those expected from either a
spiral or an E/S0 galaxy at any redshift associated with the 4C+09.17 system.
Since this object lies along the same direction as the radio jet/lobe of
4C+09.17, as well as the extended Ly-alpha emission mapped by Heckman et al.
(1991) we suggest that this component can be explained as a combination of
strong line emission and scattered QSO light. The resolved, diffuse emission
surrounding 4C+09.17 is bright, K~17.0 mag, and about one magnitude redder in
J-K than the quasar. If this emission is starlight, a very luminous elliptical
host galaxy is implied for 4C+09.17. Scattered and reddened AGN light, emission
line gas, and flux from absorbing galaxies along the line of sight may all
contribute to this emission.

distribution of hits along tracks in dense calorimeters due to multiple Coulomb
scattering (MCS). The method requires only well-aligned conventional drift
chambers or similar tracking devices and can be implemented with or without a
magnetic field present. Neutrino experiments can use this technique to increase
acceptance for large angle charged-current scattering events. Resolutions in a
typical detector geometry vary from ~10% at p=20 GeV/c to ~50% for p=500 GeV/c,
if the number of hits on the track is sufficient.

Critical exponents vary along this line in a similar way as in the non-compact

constructed.

The existence of a universal term in the expression for the slope, due purely
to vacuum effects, independent of the energy and of the particular hadronic
system, is investigated. Accounting for the two independent correlation
functions of the QCD vacuum, we improve the simple and consistent description
given by the model of the stochastic vacuum to the high-energy pp and pbar-p

We study the fermion condensate for these unconnected worlds as a function of

theory do depend on this vacuum parameter k. Technically, the value of the
fermion condensate is related to the value of the gluon condensate via the
Operator Product Expansion. We use this to find the leading dependence (in the
limit of a heavy quark) of the fermion condensate on the nontrivial vacuum
angle k. We also determine the gluon condensate of the theory using low-energy

compared to that in the inclusive processes in which we do not identify
final-state particles and use only the calorimetric information. In
semi-inclusive processes the azimuthal asymmetry is more conspicuous when the
incident lepton is an antineutrino or a positron than when the incident lepton
is a neutrino or an electron. We analyze all the possible charged weak-current
processes and study the quantitative aspects of each process. We also compare
this result to the ep scattering with a photon exchange.
