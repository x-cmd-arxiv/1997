structures crossing the Galactic Plane in the Crux region have now become
clear. A narrow, nearby filament from (l,b) = (340 deg, -25 deg) to the
Centaurus cluster can be traced. This filament runs almost parallel to the
extension of the Hydra-Antlia clusters found earlier and is part of what we
have earlier termed the ``Centaurus Wall'' extending in redshift-space between
0 < v < 6000 km/s (Fairall & Paverd 1995). The main outcome of this survey
however, is the recognition of another massive extended structure between 4000

structure is believed to be associated with the Great Attractor. The survey has
furthermore revealed a set of cellular structures, similar to those seen in

event may be reduced by several (~ 4-6) orders of magnitude, and the event rate
increased correspondingly. Extreme conditions in gamma ray bursters lead to
highly relativistic motions (bulk Lorentz factors Gamma > 100). This results in
strong forward beaming of the emitted radiation in the observer's rest frame.
Thus, all information on gamma ray bursts comes from those ejecta emitted in a
narrow cone (opening angle 1/Gamma) pointing towards the observer. We are at
present ignorant of whether there are ejecta outside that cone or not.
  The recent detection of longer wavelength transients following gamma ray
bursts allows an empirical test of whether gamma ray bursts are collimated jets
or spherical fireballs. The bulk Lorentz factor of the burst ejecta will
decrease with time after the event, as the ejecta sweep up the surrounding
medium. Thus, radiation from the ejecta is beamed into an ever increasing solid
angle as the burst remnant evolves. It follows that if gamma ray bursts are
highly collimated, many more optical and radio transients should be observed
without associated gamma rays than with them. Published supernova searches may
contain enough data to test the most extreme models of gamma ray beaming. We
close with a brief discussion of other possible consequences of beaming,
including its effect on the evolution of burst remnants.

degrade the image either because of charge transfer inefficiency or because of

Old, metal rich galaxies, such as giant ellipticals, naturally develop a UV
upturn within a reasonable time scale - less than a Hubble time - without the
presence of young stars. The most likely stars to dominate the UV flux of such
populations are low mass, core helium burning (HB and evolved HB) stars.
Metal-poor populations produce a higher ratio of UV-to-V flux, due to opacity
effects, but only metal-rich stars develop a UV upturn, in which the flux
increases towards shorter UV wavelengths. Model color-magnitude diagrams and
corresponding integrated spectra (for various values of age, metallicity,
helium enrichment, mass loss efficiency, initial mass function, and the HB mass

above the two-dimensional ($d$) superfluid-insulator quantum critical point. We
argue that the transport is characterized by inelastic collisions among
thermally excited carriers at a rate of order $k_B T/\hbar$. This implies that
the transport at frequencies $\omega \ll k_B T/\hbar$ is in the hydrodynamic,
collision-dominated (or `incoherent') regime, while $\omega \gg k_B T/\hbar$ is
the collisionless (or `phase-coherent') regime. The conductivity is argued to
be $e^2 / h$ times a non-trivial universal scaling function of $\hbar \omega /
k_B T$, and not independent of $\hbar \omega/k_B T$, as has been previously
claimed, or implicitly assumed. The experimentally measured d.c. conductivity
is the hydrodynamic $\hbar \omega/k_B T \to 0$ limit of this function, and is a
universal number times $e^2 / h$, even though the transport is incoherent.
Previous work determined the conductivity by incorrectly assuming it was also
equal to the collisionless $\hbar \omega/k_B T \to \infty$ limit of the scaling
function, which actually describes phase-coherent transport with a conductivity
given by a different universal number times $e^2 / h$. We provide the first
computation of the universal d.c. conductivity in a disorder-free boson model,
along with explicit crossover functions, using a quantum Boltzmann equation and
an expansion in $\epsilon=3-d$. The case of spin transport near quantum
critical points in antiferromagnets is also discussed. Similar ideas should
apply to the transitions in quantum Hall systems and to metal-insulator
transitions. We suggest experimental tests of our picture and speculate on a
new route to self-duality at two-dimensional quantum critical points.

carefully for various values of \alpha. As \alpha increases beyond the

different from the Heisenberg model but the same with the Majumdar-Ghosh model.
Some of these features depend only on the value of \alpha and not on \delta: a
parameter introduced for the coupling alternation. By comparing these results
with a recent inelastic neutron scattering spectrum of an inorganic
spin-Peierls compound CuGeO_3 [M. Arai et al.: Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 (1996)

(\alpha=0.4-0.45), and at least \alpha must be larger than \alpha_c to some
extent. The value of J is evaluated at \sim 180K consistent with other

SU(2)xSU(2)xU(1) group with the peculiarity that the gauge bosons of the extra
SU(2) do not couple to fermions. This feature relaxes some of the constraints
on the masses of the new gauge bosons, leaving the possibility of having
lighter masses than in traditional extensions. The model exhibits several
interesting properties, it is anomaly free and at tree level it does not have
FCNC while loop induced effects are strongly suppressed. Also, from the
analysis of $\Delta \rho$ at one loop, two configurations for the vevs giving
rise to a screening phenomenon are identified. One of these configurations can
also be related with the Bess model. A tree level fit to the most recent
electroweak data is performed confirming the possibility of having new light
gauge boson masses. The constraints coming from different FCNC processes like
$b \to s \gamma$, $B_{0}-{\bar B}_{0}$ and $K_{0}-{\bar K}_{0}$ mixing are also
taken into account. Finally, a generalization of this model for the case of
having several extra copies of SU(2) groups is commented, focusing on the
presence of screening configurations and the corresponding mass spectrum.

find that there are a finite number of particles at infinity in this state,

four dimensions have been studied in considerable detail recently, by realizing
them as geometric manipulations of configurations of extended objects in type
II string theory. These extended objects include `D-branes' and
`NS-(five)branes'. In constructing the brane configurations which realize
dualities for orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups, an `orientifold' was
introduced, which results in non-orientable string sectors. Certain features of
orientifolded NS-branes -such as their existence- were assumed in the original
construction, which have not been verified directly. However, those features
fit very well together with the properties of the relevant field theories, and
subsequently yielded the known dualities. This letter describes how
orientifolded NS-branes can exist in type II string theory by displaying
explicitly that the assumed combinations of world-sheet and space-time
symmetries do indeed leave the NS-brane invariant and therefore can be gauged.
The resulting orientifolded NS-brane can be described in terms of background
fields, and furthermore as an exact conformal field theory, to exactly the same
extent as the standard NS-brane.

(the Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant form), the reduced Hamilton equations
in the covariant rest-frame Coulomb gauge for the isolated system of N scalar
particles with pseudoclassical Grassmann-valued electric charges plus the
electromagnetic field are studied. The Lienard-Wiechert potentials of the
particles are evaluated and it is shown how the causality problems of the
Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation are solved at the pseudoclassical level. Then,
the covariant rest-frame description of scalar electrodynamics is given.
Applying to it the Feshbach-Villars formalism, the connection with the particle
plus electromagnetic field system is found.

the classical QCD Lagrangian and with the color field present, in the N=2
(meson) case. A special form of the requirement of having only color singlets,
suited for a field-independent quark model, produces a ``pseudoclassical

function of the lowest lying meson by combining fermion mass perturbation
theory with a variational approach. All calculations are done entirely in the
fermionic representation without using any bosonization scheme. In a
step-by-step procedure we enlarge the space of variational parameters. For the
first two steps, the results are obtained analytically. Beyond that we use
computer algebraic and numerical methods. We achieve good convergence so that
the calculation of the meson mass squared can be extended to third order in the
fermion mass. Within the numerical treatment we include higher Fock states up
to six particles. Our results are consistent with all previous numerical
investigations, in particular lattice calculations. For the massive Schwinger
model, we find a small discrepancy (less than 2 percent) in comparison with
known bosonization results. Possible resolutions of this discrepancy are
discussed.

to distinguish between long-lived and short-lived candidates where the former
ones are detectable in present heavy ion experiments while the latter ones in
future heavy ion experiments, respectively. We find some long-lived strangelet
candidates which are highly negatively charged with a mass to charge ratio like
a anti deuteron (M/Z=-2) but masses of A=10 to 16. We predict also many
short-lived candidates, both in quark and in hadronic form, which can be highly
charged. Purely hyperonic nuclei are bound and have a negative charge while
carrying a positive baryon number. We demonstrate also that multiply charmed
exotics (charmlets) might be bound and can be produced at future heavy ion
colliders.
