Anderson insulting state indicates a striking difference between the Mott and
Efros-Shklovskii (ES) insulators. In the former, the trans-resistance $\rho_t$
is monotonically increasing with the localization length $\xi$; in the latter,
the presence of a Coulomb gap leads to an opposite result: $\rho_t$ is enhanced
with a decreasing $\xi$, with the same exponential factor as the single layer
resistivity. This distinction reflects the relatively pronounced role of
excited density fluctuations in the ES state, implied by the enhancement in the
rate of hopping processes at low frequencies. The magnitude of drag is
estimated for typical experimental parameters in the different cases. It is
concluded that a measurement of drag can be used to distinguish between
interacting and non-interacting insulating state.

restored at an exponential rate as the size of the extra dimension increases.
Before this method can be used in dynamical simulations of lattice QCD, the
dependence of the restoration rate to the other parameters of the theory and,
in particular, the lattice spacing must be investigated. In this paper such an
investigation is carried out in the context of the two flavor lattice Schwinger

chemical potential dependent bag pressure at the phase boundary. This makes it
possible to regulate the total entropy and baryon number in both phases, i. e.
the flow of the specific entropy per baryon across the phase boundary. We have
also determined the functional form of the temperature and chemical potential
