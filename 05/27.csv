dynamically self-consistent spatial distribution of particles of galactic dark
matter. They have come up with the rather unorthodox conclusion that the mean
velocity dispersion of dark matter particles ``should be $600 kms$ or larger''.
Their letter triggered immediate comments (Evans 1996, Gates et al. 1996). Here
we find, as did Cowsik et al. (1996a), that models of the dark matter halo can
be made consistent with velocity dispersion much larger than that expected from
a simple application of the virial theorem in the solar neighbourhood. But in
contrast to their conclusions, we show that using their model, we also obtain
solutions with smaller velocity dispersion down to $\sim 270 kms$. These more
orthodox dispersions arise because of less constraining boundary conditions for
the central density but do not rely on indirect or model dependent measurements
of the large scale distance behaviour of the rotation curve.

be calculated to linear order on the assumption of statistical isotropy but
without further approximation. In this paper, we calculate the measured
two-dimensional power for a constant declination strip, widely used in redshift
surveys. We present a likelihood method for estimating the three-dimensional
real-space power spectrum and the redshift distortion simultaneously, and show
that for thin surveys of reasonable depth, the large-scale 3D power cannot be
measured with high accuracy. The redshift distortion may be estimated
successfully, and with higher accuracy if the 3D power spectrum can be measured
independently, for example from a large-scale sky-projected catalogue. In the

having progressed through many deaths and resurrections. The first scientific
gravity theory, Newton's, was that of a scalar potential field, so it was
natural for Einstein and others to consider the possibility of incorporating
gravity into special relativity as a scalar theory. This effort, though
fruitless in its original intent, nevertheless was useful in leading the way to
Einstein's general relativity, a purely two-tensor field theory. However, a
universally coupled scalar field again appeared, both in the context of Dirac's
large number hypothesis and in five dimensional unified field theories as
studied by Fierz, Jordan, and others. While later experimentation seems to
indicate that if such a scalar exists its influence on solar system size
interactions is negligible, other reincarnations have been proposed under the
guise of dilatons in string theory and inflatons in cosmology. This paper

D56 (1997) 6439-6457","10.1103/PhysRevD.56.6439",,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  Numerical relativity, applied to collisions of black holes, starts with
initial data for black holes already in each other's strong field. The initial
hypersurface data typically used for computation is based on mathematical
simplifying prescriptions, such as conformal flatness of the 3-geometry and
longitudinality of the extrinsic curvature. In the case of head on collisions
of equal mass holes, there is evidence that such prescriptions work reasonably
well, but it is not clear why, or whether this success is more generally valid.
Here we study these questions by considering the ``particle limit'' for head on
collisions of nonspinning holes. Einstein's equations are linearized in the
mass of the small hole, and described by a single gauge invariant spacetime
function psi, for each multipole. The resulting equations have been solved by
numerical evolution for collisions starting from various initial separations,
and the evolution is studied on a sequence of hypersurfaces. In particular, we
extract hypersurface data, that is psi and its time derivative, on surfaces of
constant background Schwarzschild time. These evolved data can then be compared
with ``prescribed'' data, evolved data can be replaced by prescribed data on
any hypersurface, and evolved further forward in time, a gauge invariant
measure of deviation from conformal flatness can be evaluated, etc. The main
findings of this study are: (i) For holes of unequal mass the use of prescribed
data on late hypersurfaces is not successful. (ii) The failure is likely due to
the inability of the prescribed data to represent the near field of the smaller
hole. (iii) The discrepancy in the extrinsic curvature is more important than
in the 3-geometry. (iv) The use of the more general conformally flat
longitudinal data does not notably improve this picture.

transition matrix elements of radiative processes occurring in the cosmos. To
begin with, the very concept of time is delineated in classical physics in
terms of correlations between the succession of configurations which describe a
process and a standard trajectory called the clock. The total is an isolated
system of fixed energy. This is relevant for cosmology in that the universe is
an isolated system which we take to be homogeneous and isotropic. Furthermore,
in virtue of the constraint which arises from reparametrization invariance of
time, it has total energy zero. Therefore the momentum of the scale factor is
determined from the energy of matter. In the quantum theory this is exploited
through use of the WKB approximation for the wave function of the scale factor,
justified for a large universe. The formalism then gives rise to matrix
elements describing matter processes. These are shown to take on the form of
usual time dependent quantum amplitudes wherein the temporal dependence is
given by a background which is once more fixed by the total energy of matter.

straightforward extension of the quasitriangularity property involves a
