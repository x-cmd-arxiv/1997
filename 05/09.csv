galaxies to explain galaxy number counts, redshift distributions and some other
related observations. We first infer that irregular galaxies and the disks of
spiral galaxies are young, probably formed at $z\approx 0.5-2$ from a
simultaneous consideration of colours and gas content under a moderate
assumption on the star formation history. Assuming that elliptical galaxies and
bulges of spiral galaxies, both called spheroids in the discussion, had formed
early in the universe, the resulting scenario is that spiral galaxies formed as
intergalactic gas accreting onto pre-existing bulges mostly at $z\approx 1-2$;
irregular galaxies as seen today formed by aggregation of clouds at $z\approx
0.5-1.5$. Taking the formation epochs thus estimated into account, we construct
a model for the history of galaxies employing a stellar population synthesis
model. We assume that the number of galaxies does not change except that some
of them (irregulars) were newly born, and use a morphology-dependent local
luminosity function to constrain the number of galaxies. The predictions of the
model are compared with the observation of galaxy number counts and redshift
distributions for the $B$, $I$ and $K$ colour bands. It is shown that young
irregular galaxies cause the steep slope of the $B$-band counts. The fraction
of irregular galaxies increases with decreasing brightness: at $B=24$ mag, they
contribute as much as spiral galaxies. Thus, ``the faint blue galaxy problem''
is solved by invoking young galaxies. This interpretation is corroborated by a
comparison of our prediction with the morphologically-classified galaxy counts
in the $I$ band.

and dependence on the galaxy luminosity (mass), observed in elliptical galaxies
are customarily considered as reliable indicators of systematic differences in
age and abundances of Mg and Fe. In this paper, we address the question whether
or not the indices Mg2 and <Fe> (and their gradients) are real indicators of
chemical abundances and enhancement of these or other effects must be taken
into account. We show that this is not the case because the above indices are
severely affected by the unknown relative percentage of stars as function of
the metallicity. In order to cast the problem, first we provide basic
calibrations for the variations dHb, dMg2, and d<Fe> as a function of the age
Dlog(t) (in Gyr), metallicity Dlog(Z/Z_o), and D[Mg/Fe]. Second, we analyze the
implications of the gradients in Mg2 and <Fe> observed across these systems.
Finally, the above calibration is used to explore the variations from galaxy to
galaxy of the nuclear values of Hb, Mg2, and <Fe>. The differences dHb, dMg2,
and d<Fe> are converted to differences Dlog(t), Dlog(Z/Z_o), and D[Mg/Fe]. We
thoroughly examine the relationship Dlog(t)-Mv, Dlog(Z/Z_o)-Mv, and
D[Mg/Fe]-Mv, and advance the suggestion that the duration of the star forming
period gets longer or the age of the last episode of stellar activity gets
closer to the present at decreasing galaxy mass. This result is discussed in
the context of current theories of galaxy formation and evolution. i.e. merger
and isolation. In brief, we conclude that none of these can explain the results
of our analysis, and suggest that the kind of time and space dependent IMF
proposed by Padoan et al. (1997) and the associated models of elliptical
galaxies elaborated by Chiosi et al. (1997) should be at work.

instability in observations with RXTE, revealing X-ray light curves and
emission states unlike anything previously seen. Variable QPOs in the range of
0.07--10 Hz have been monitored with the capability to track the individual
oscillations. The QPO amplitude is as high as 40% of the mean flux, while both
amplitude and phase lag increase with photon energy. The results imply a direct
link between the QPO mechanism and the origin of the energetic electrons
believed to radiate the X-ray power-law component. GRS1915+105 also displays a
transient yet stationary QPO at 67 Hz. The other source, GRO J1655-40, is an
optically established black hole binary. Recent optical reports include an
excellent model for the binary inclination and masses, while an optical
precursor to the April 1996 X-ray outburst has been measured. We report new

canonical ``soft/high'' and ``very high'' X-ray states, with QPOs at 8--22 Hz
during the latter state. In addition, there is a high-frequency QPO at 300 Hz.
The rapid oscillations in these sources are suspected of providing a measure of
the mass and rotation of the accreting black holes, although several competing
models may be applied when evaluating the results.

rising power-law $dN/dm\propto m^{-\alpha}$, with $0.5\wig < \alpha \wig <
1.5$, down to $\sim 0.1 \msol$, independently of the metallicity, suggesting a
rather universal behaviour of the cluster initial mass functions. We predict
luminosity functions in the NICMOS filters in the stellar and in the brown
dwarf domains for different mass functions and metallicities.
  We apply these calculations to the determination, slope and normalization, of
the mass function of the Galactic halo (spheroid and dark halo). The spheroid
mass function is well described by the afore-mentioned power-law function with
$\alpha \sim 1.7\pm 0.2$ down to 0.1 $\msol$, although a slowly decreasing mass
function below $\sim 0.15 \msol$ can not be excluded with the data presently
available. Comparison with the Hubble Deep Field star counts is consistent with
such a mass function and excludes a significant stellar population in the dark
halo.
  Consistent analysis with recent microlensing experiments towards the LMC
shows that the spheroid and the dark-halo stellar+brown dwarf populations
represent at most $\sim$ 1% of the Galactic dark matter density. This clearly
excludes brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as significant dark matter candidates.

consideration is obtained by piling up two types of layers with respectively
$p$ and $q$ spin rows coupled via nearest neighbor interactions $\lambda r$ and
$\lambda$, where the succession of layers follows an aperiodic sequence. Far
away from the critical regime, the correlation length $\xi_\perp$ is smaller
than the first layer width and the system exhibits the usual behavior of an
ordinary surface transition. In the other limit, in the neighborhood of the
critical point, $\xi_\perp$ diverges and the fluctuations are sensitive to the
non-periodic structure of the system so that the critical behavior is governed
by a new fixed point. We determine the critical exponent associated to the
surface magnetization at the aperiodic critical point and show that the
expected crossover between the two regimes is well described by a scaling
function. From numerical calculations, the parallel correlation length
$\xi_\parallel$ is then found to behave with an anisotropy exponent $z$ which
depends on the aperiodic modulation and the layer widths.

unification. This is achieved by the inverted hierarchy mechanism which
generates a large scalar expectation value compared to the size of

squark, slepton masses due to two-loop renormalization group equation. The

suppressed enough to maintain the virtue of the gauge mediation. The model is

acts both on the gauge group and on the $T^{d+1}$, reduces the gauge group to
O(N) over 1+1 dimensional fixed-point submanifolds, and breaks half of the
supersymmetry. We clarify some puzzling aspects of the gauge anomaly
cancellation in the presence of space-time Wilson lines; in general, the
Yang-Mills theory requires certain Chern-Simons couplings to supergravity
background fields. We discuss the possibility that D8-branes are present as
certain matrix configurations in the Yang-Mills theory, and the fundamental
fermions emerge as zero modes. Finally, we point out that the correspondence
between matrix theory and string theory suggests the existence of a multitude
of non-trivial RG fixed points and dualities in orbifold Yang-Mills theories
with eight supercharges in various dimensions.

beyond this order. An instanton computation in similar three dimensional
theories shows that these terms are renormalized. Hence, the four dimensional
