relation between the dust-to-gas ratio and the metallicity is quasi-linear,

implying that the commonly used power-law approximation is very poor; (ii) the
deviation from the linear behavior depends critically on the parameter $\chi$,

formation rate (SFR); (iii) the shape of the curve representing the relation
between the dust-to-gas ratio and the metallicity does not depend on the SFR,

higher $\psi$, together with a significant differential mass outflow. Thus, the

expected for their metallicity. However, NGC 6388 and 6441 also exhibit a
prominent blue HB (BHB) extension, including stars reaching as faint in V as
the turnoff luminosity. This discovery demonstrates directly for the first time
that a major population of hot HB stars can exist in old, metal-rich systems.
This may have important implications for the interpretation of the integrated
spectra of elliptical galaxies.
  The cause of the phenomenon remains uncertain. We examine the possibility
that NGC 6388 and 6441 are older than the other clusters, but a simple
difference in age may not be sufficient to produce the observed distributions
along the HB. The high central densities in NGC 6388 and 6441 suggest that the
existence of the blue HB (BHB) tails might be caused by stellar interactions in
the dense cores of these clusters, which we calculate to have two of the
highest collision rates among globular clusters in the Galaxy. Tidal collisions
might act in various ways to enhance loss of envelope mass, and therefore
populate the blue side of the HB. However, the relative frequency of tidal
collisions does not seem large enough (compared to that of the clusters with
pure RHBs) to account for such a drastic difference in HB morphology. While a
combination of an age difference and dynamical interactions may help, prima
facie the lack of a radial gradient in the BHB/RHB star ratio seems to argue
against dynamical effects playing a role.

clustering of Ly$\alpha$ clouds.
  Motivated by these observations together with another observation which
reports the detection of metal in the Ly$\alpha$ clouds at high redshift
universe, we propose the two-component protogalaxy modelas a model for the
Ly$\alpha$ cloud based upon the previous work.
  In our model,the Ly$\alpha$ clouds are supposed to be stable cold clouds
confined by the pressure of ambient hot gas in galactic halo.
  We determine the properties of these cold clouds and hot gas on the basis of
theoretical and observational constraints. Especially, we take into account the
stability of a cold cloud in the galactic halo in addition to the general
stability conditions in a two-component medium, and compare the derived
quantities of Ly$\alpha$ clouds both cases in galactic halo and in
intergalactic medium between high and low redshifts.
  We conclude that the condition that a cloud is stable against both
evaporation and tidal destruction by a hot galactic halo is very restrictive.
  As a result, in the most noteworthy case, at z${\sim}$0.5,it is concluded
that a pressure-confined, stable spherical Ly$\alpha$ cloud with typical
neutral hydrogen column density $N_{HI}=10^{14}cm^{-2}$ cannot survive in the
galactic halo, although much higher column density clouds of $N_{HI}=

account the observed luminosity distribution, the flattening profile and the

the particular case of a disc galaxy composed by two spheroidal bodies: an
exponential disc and a bulge following the r^{1/4} law. We studied the behavior
of the stellar rotation- and velocity dispersion- profiles along the sequence
of S0s and Spirals, identified by an increasing disc-to-bulge ratio. Inside
every class, kinematic curves were produced by changing the relative
concentration of the two components and the inclination of the galaxy with
respect to the line of sight. The comparison with observational data requires
only two scaling factors: the total mass of the galaxy, and the effective
radius.
  The model allows also to detect the presence of anisotropy in the velocity
distribution. In the special case of S0s, we explored the sensitivity of the
kinematics of the model by changing the anisotropy and the flattening of the
bulge. For intermediate flattening (0.4<b/a<0.85) it is possible to distinguish
a change of anisotropy of 15%.
  To show a real case, the model has been applied to the photometric and
kinematic data of NGC 5866. We plan to apply these models to a larger database

part of the flow. The line is strongly broadened, but the fact that the flow is
quasi-spherical removes the two-peak shape of the line seen in the spectra

low-frequency maximum has a finite amplitude even in the absence of damping. We
also obtain an evolution of the Raman profile from an asymmetric form around
$\omega^{(1)}_{res}$ to a symmetric form around $\omega^{(2)}_{res}$. We
further show that the TMPH depends on the fermionic quasiparticle damping, the
next-nearest neighbor hopping term $t^{\prime}$ and the corrections to the
interaction vertex between light and the fermionic current. We discuss our

Using a non-adiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase approach, we obtain the exact

the energy eigenstates. Spin precession of electrons encircling the ring can
lead to various interference phenomena such as oscillating persistent current

breaking therein with the spin degree of freedom being fully taken into

that, once the quark and antiquark structure functions are constrained from the

the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and the forward-backward charge asymmetry

has recently been used to estimate long-distance effects in $B\to X_s\gamma$.
We generalize this analysis to the case of nonvanishing photon invariant mass,
$q^2\not= 0$, relevant for the rare decay mode $B\to X_se^+e^-$. In the
phenomenologically interesting $q^2$ region away from the $c\bar c$ resonances,
the heavy quark expansion approach should provide a reasonable description of
possible nonperturbative corrections. In particular this picture is preferable
to the model-dependent approach relying on the tails of Breit-Wigner
resonances, which has been employed so far in the literature to account for
these effects. We find that the ${\cal O}(\Lambda^2_{QCD}/m^2_c)$ corrections
to the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and to the forward-backward asymmetry
in $B\to X_se^+e^-$ amount to several percent at most for $q^2/m^2_b < 0.3$ and
$q^2/m^2_b > 0.6$. The ${\cal O}(\Lambda^2_{QCD}/m^2_c)$ correction to the
$B\to X_s\gamma$ decay rate is also computed and found to be +3%, which agrees
in magnitude with previous calculations. Finally, we comment on long-distance
effects in $B\to X_s\nu\bar\nu$, which in this case are extremely suppressed
due to the absence of virtual photon contributions.

by Furnstahl, Tang and Serot that incorporates the trace anomaly of QCD in
terms of a light-quark (quarkonium) degree of freedom with the heavy (gluonium)
degree of freedom integrated out. The large anomalous dimension $d_{an}\approx
5/3$ for the scalar field found by Furnstahl et al to be needed for a correct
description of nuclear matter is interpreted as an indication for a
strong-coupling regime and the ground state given by the BR-scaled parameters
is suggested as the background around which fluctuations can be rendered weak
so that mean-field approximation is reliable. We construct a simple model with
BR scaled parameters that provides a satisfactory description of the properties
of matter at normal nuclear matter density. Given this, fluctuations around the
BR scaled background are dominated by tree diagrams. Our reasoning relies
heavily on recent developments in the study of nucleon and kaon properties in
normal and dense nuclear matter, e.g., nucleon and kaon flows in heavy-ion
processes, kaonic atoms, and kaon condensation in dense compact-star matter.

  It is demonstrated that a homotopy associative star algebra with a compatible

it has the structure of a direct sum of full matrix algebras. The resulting

quasiclassical variable $X$ with a set of quantum variables $x$ that goes
beyond the usual mean field approximation. The idea is to regard the quantum
system as continuously and imprecisely measured by the classical system. The
effective equations of motion for the classical system therefore consist of
treating the quantum variable $x$ as a stochastic c-number $\x (t) $ the
probability distibution for which is given by the theory of continuous quantum
measurements. The resulting theory is similar to the usual mean field equations
(in which $x$ is replaced by its quantum expectation value) but with two
differences: a noise term, and more importantly, the state of the quantum
subsystem evolves according to the stochastic non-linear Schrodinger equation
of a continuously measured system. In the case in which the quantum system
starts out in a superposition of well-separated localized states, the classical
system goes into a statistical mixture of trajectories, one trajectory for each
individual localized state.
