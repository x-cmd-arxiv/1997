cluster correlations is performed without any assumptions on the nature of the
distribution itself. The cluster samples show fractal correlations up to sample
limits ($\approx 70 h^{-1} Mpc$) with fractal dimension $D \approx 2$, without
any tendency towards homogenization. Our analysis shows that the standard
correlation methods are incorrect, since they give a finite correlation length
for a distribution that does not possess one. In particular, the so called
correlation length $r_{0}$ is shown to be simply a fraction of the sample size.
Moreover we conclude that galaxies and clusters are two different
representations of the same self similar structure and that the correlations of
clusters are the continuation of those of galaxies to larger scales.

  accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal","Astrophysical Journal 488 (1997) 524","10.1086/304734",,"astro-ph",,"  Several recent measurements have been made of the angular correlation
function $w(\theta,m)$ of faint galaxies in deep surveys (e.g., Hubble Deep
Field, HDF). Are the measured correlations indicative of gravitational growth
of primordial perturbations or of the relationship between galaxies and (dark
matter dominated) galaxy haloes? A first step in answering this question is to
determine the typical spatial separations of galaxies whose spatial
correlations, $\xi(r,z),$ contribute most to w.
  The median spatial separation of galaxy pairs contributing to a fraction $p$
of $w$ for a galaxy survey is denoted by r_{eff} and compared with the
perpendicular distance, $r_\perp,$ at the median redshift, z_{median}, of the
galaxies. Over a wide range in $\xi$ growth rates $\epsilon$ and in
$z_{median}, \r_eff(50%) \ltsim r_\perp$ and $\r_eff(90%) \sim 4 r_\perp.$
  Values of r_eff for typical redshift distributions indicate that many $w$
measurements correspond to spatial correlations at comoving length scales well
below 1 h^-1 Mpc. For $\Omega_0=1$ and $\lambda_0=0$, the correlation signal at
4\arcsec predominant in the Villumsen et al. (1996) estimates of $w$ for faint
HDF galaxies corresponds to r_eff(50%)(HDF) \approx 40 h^-1 kpc; other
cosmologies and angles up to 10\arcsec can increase this to r_eff(50%)(HDF)
$\ltsim 200 h^-1 kpc. The proper separations are (1+z) times smaller.
  These scales are small: the faint galaxy $w$ measurements are at scales where
halo and/or galaxy existence, let alone interactions, may modify the spatial
correlation function. These measurements could maybe be used to probe the
radial extent of haloes at high redshift.

galaxies in 19 Abell clusters. This method, applied here primarily in the R
band, is based on the surface brightness fluctuations technique of
extragalactic distance measurement. The sample galaxies range in redshift from
5000 to 10,000 \kms, and were selected primarily from the Lauer & Postman
(1994) survey of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).
  We find a tight correlation between the GC specific frequency S_N of the
central bright galaxy in the cluster and the cluster velocity dispersion. S_N
also correlates well with the cluster X-ray temperature and with the number of
bright neighboring galaxies, less well with the galaxy profile, and only
marginally with galaxy luminosity and overall cluster richness. It does not
correlate with cluster morphology class. Thus, unlike galaxy luminosity, S_N is
determined by the cluster mass, or density. To account for this situation, we
propose that the GCs formed early and in proportion to the available mass,
while the luminosity growth of the galaxy was later halted, yielding the
observed correlations of S_N with density. We introduce a quantity called
$\eta_{GC}$, the number of GCs per unit local cluster mass. For a simple
cluster mass model, $\eta_{GC}$ is found to be constant, indicating a uniform
GC production rate per unit available mass.
  A measurement of the Gaussian width $\sigma$ of the GC luminosity function
(GCLF) is one of the byproducts of our analysis. In the cosmic microwave
background frame, the mean width for this sample is $< \sigma > = 1.43$ mag,

different geometries, to the broad-band X-ray spectrum of the black hole
candidate Cygnus X-1. As shown in a companion paper (Dove, Wilms, and
Begelman), models where the Comptonizing medium is a slab surrounding the cold
accretion disk cannot have a temperature higher than about 120 keV for optical
depths greater than 0.2, resulting in spectra that are much softer than the
observed 10-30 keV spectrum of Cyg X-1. In addition, the slab geometry models
predict a substantial ``soft excess'' at low energies, a feature not observed
for Cyg X-1, and Fe K\alpha fluorescence lines that are stronger than observed.
Previous Comptonization models in the literature invoke a slab geometry with
the optical depth \tau_T \gta 0.3 and the coronal temperature T_c \sim 150 keV,
but they are not self-consistent. Therefore, ADC models with a slab geometry
are not appropriate for explaining the X-ray spectrum of Cyg X-1. Models with a
spherical corona and an exterior disk, however, predict much higher
self-consistent coronal temperatures than the slab geometry models. The higher
coronal temperatures are due to the lower amount of reprocessing of coronal
radiation in the accretion disk, giving rise to a lower Compton cooling rate.
Therefore, for the sphere+disk geometry, the predicted spectrum can be hard
enough to describe the observed X-ray continuum of Cyg X-1 while predicting Fe
fluorescence lines having an equivalent width of \sim 40 eV. Our best-fit
parameter values for the sphere+disk geometry are \tau_T \approx 1.5 and T_c

cosmological code with a realistic and robust treatment of multi-species
primordial gas chemistry, paying special attention to the formation and
destruction of hydrogen molecules, non-equilibrium ionization, and cooling
processes. We performed 3-D simulations at small scales and at high redshifts
and find that, analogous to simulations of large scale structure, a complex
system of filaments, sheets, and spherical knots at the intersections of
filaments form. On the mass scales covered by our simulations (5x10^5 -
1x10^9\Ms) that collapse at redshifts z>25, we find that only at the spherical
knots can enough H2 be formed (n_{H_2}/n_H > 5x10^-4) to cool the gas
appreciably. Quantities such as the time dependence of the formation of H2
molecules, the final H2 fraction, and central densities from the simulations
are compared to the theoretical predictions of Abel (1995) and Tegmark et al.
(1997) and found to agree remarkably well. Comparing the 3-D results to an
isobaric collapse model we further discuss the possible implications of the
extensive merging of small structure that is inherent in hierarchical models.
Typically only 5-8% percent of the total baryonic mass in the collapsing
structures is found to cool significanlty. Assuming the Padoan (1995) model for
star formation our results would predict the first stellar systems to be as
small as ~30\Ms. Some implications for primordial globular cluster formation
scenarios are also discussed.

all samples belong to the same growth class, in which the surface roughness
scales linearly with lateral size at small scales and appears to saturate at
large scales. For length scales ranging from 1 nm to 100 $\mu$m, the scaling
behavior can be described by a linear continuum model consisting of a surface
diffusion term and a Laplacian term. However, in-depth analysis on
non-universal amplitudes indicates the breaking of up-down symmetry, suggesting
the presence of non-linear terms in the microscopic model. We argue that the
leading non-linear term has the form of $\lambda _1(\nabla h)^2$, but its
effect on scaling exponents will not be evident for length scales less than 1
mm. Therefore, the growth dynamics of this system is described by the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, consisting of the two linear terms plus $\lambda
_1(\nabla h)^2$, driven by a Gaussian noise. We also discuss the negative
coefficient in the Laplacian term as an instability mechanism responsible for
large scale film morphology on the final surface.

deformation of the topological $BF$ theory where, beside the two-form field
$B$, one has to add one extra-field $\eta$ given by a one-form which transforms
as the difference of two connections. The ensuing action functional gives a
theory that is both classically and quantistically equivalent to the original
Yang--Mills theory. In order to prove such an equivalence, it is shown that the
dependency on the field $\eta$ can be gauged away completely. This gives rise
to a field theory that, for this reason, can be considered as semi-topological
or topological in some but not all the fields of the theory. The symmetry group
involved in this theory is an affine extension of the tangent gauge group
acting on the tangent bundle of the space of connections. A mathematical
analysis of this group action and of the relevant BRST complex is discussed in
details.

its origin less than two years ago. Encoded quantum information can be
protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the
environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional
mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum
information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an
arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that
the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain
critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10^6
qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10^{-6}, would be
a formidable factoring engine. Even a smaller, less accurate quantum computer
would be able to perform many useful tasks. (This paper is based on a talk

quantum computer with noisy gates to perform reliably. Quantum computing
hardware is still in its infancy; I comment on the specifications that should
be met by future hardware. Over the past few years, work on quantum computation
has erected a new classification of computational complexity, has generated
profound insights into the nature of decoherence, and has stimulated the
formulation of new techniques in high-precision experimental physics. A broad
interdisciplinary effort will be needed if quantum computers are to fulfill
their destiny as the world's fastest computing devices. (This paper is an
