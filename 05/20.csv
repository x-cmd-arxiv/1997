regions of black holes accretion disks. Previous studies have assumed that only
material outside the radius of marginal stability can contribute to the
observed line emission. Here, we show that fluorescence by material inside the
radius of marginal stability, which is in the process of spiralling towards the
event horizon, can have a observable influence on the iron line profile and
equivalent width. For concreteness, we consider the case of a geometrically
thin accretion disk, around a Schwarzschild black hole, in which fluorescence
is excited by an X-ray source placed at some height above the disk and on the
axis of the disk. Fully relativistic line profiles are presented for various
source heights and efficiencies. It is found that the extra line flux generally
emerges in the extreme red wing of the iron line, due to the large
gravitational redshift experienced by photons from the region within the radius
of marginal stability. We apply our models to the variable iron line seen in
the ASCA spectrum of the Seyfert nucleus MCG-6-30-15. It is found that the
change in the line profile, equivalent width, and continuum normalization, can
be well explained as being due to a change in the height of the source above
the disk. We discuss the implications of these results for distinguishing
rapidly-rotating black holes from slowly rotating holes using iron line
diagnostics.

10 degrees from the H I gas which envelops the Magellanic Clouds and the

striking feature of this component is strong Si II and Al II absorption but

which results in a wide range of allowed central temperatures. We find that the
secondary subcluster has a temperature and luminosity typical of a rich
cluster; however, the ASCA temperature map shows no signs of an advanced
merger. It is therefore assumed that the primary cluster is in hydrostatic
equilibrium. The data then require dark matter density profiles steeper than
rho ~ r^-2.5 in its outer part. Acceptable models have a total mass within
r=1.5 Mpc (the virial radius) of 6.0+-1.5 10^14 Msun at the 90% confidence,
about 1.6 times smaller than the mass derived assuming isothermality. Near the

possible asymmetry and departures from hydrostatic equilibrium, the behavior of
the mass distribution, if applicable to other clusters, can bring into better

the desirable effect of producing large surface enhancements of nitrogen and
helium, but the undesirable effect of increasing the helium-core mass at the

we seek a model that occurs with high probability in the LMC and for which the
time-scale for making the last transition from red to blue, $\sim$ 20,000
years, has a physical interpretation --- the Kelvin-Helmholtz time of the

states that the distribution function (DF) at time t can be derived from
tracing necessary orbits back to t=0. To make this procedure feasible, a
self-consistent field (SCF) method for solving Poisson's equation is adopted to
compute the orbits of arbitrary stars. As an example, for the violent
relaxation of a uniform-density sphere, the phase-space evolution which the
current method generates is compared to that obtained with a phase-space method
for integrating the collisionless Boltzmann equation, on the assumption of
spherical symmetry. Then, excellent agreement is found between the two methods
if an optimal basis set for the SCF technique is chosen. Since this
reproduction method requires only the functional form of initial DFs but needs
no assumptions about symmetry of the system, the success in reproducing the
phase-space evolution implies that there would be no need of directly solving
the collisionless Boltzmann equation in order to access phase space even for
systems without any special symmetries. The effects of basis sets used in SCF

there exist independent EMP modes spatially symmetric and antisymmetric with
respect to the edge. Certain of these modes can propagate nearly undamped even

with well-known results for a spatially homogeneous dissipation within the
channel, we obtain that the damping of the fundamental EMP is not quantized and
varies as T**3 or $T**(-3), where T is the temperature, in the high- and
low-frequency limits, respectively. The characteristic length of the resulting
dispersion relation and of the charge density distortion is the magnetic
length. The screening of the metallic gates, when present, is taken into

shown to decrease by the ${\alpha}^{-1/3}$-law similarly to the case of a
simple perceptron in a restricted range of the parameter $a$ characterizing the
non-monotonic transfer function. For other values of $a$, the perceptron
algorithm leads to the state where the weight vector of the student is just
opposite to that of the teacher. The Hebbian learning algorithm has a similar
property; it works only in a limited range of the parameter. The conventional
AdaTron algorithm does not give a vanishing generalization error for any values
of $a$.We thus introduce a modified AdaTron algorithm which yields a good
performance for all values of $a$. We also investigate the effects of
optimization of the learning rate as well as of the learning algorithm. Both
methods give excellent learning curves proportional to ${\alpha}^{-1}$. The
latter optimization is related to the Bayes statistics and is shown to yield
useful hints to extract maximum amount of information necessary to accelerate
learning processes.

Since the dynamics of the system is dominated by states with large occupation
numbers which admit a semiclassical description, the decay can be studied by
solving the classical equations of motion on the lattice. Of particular
interest is the case when the cross-coupling between the inflaton and the
second scalar field is negative, which is naturally allowed in many realistic
models. While the inflaton decays via parametric resonance in the positive
coupling case we find that for negative coupling there is a new mechanism of
particle production which we call negative coupling instability. Due to this
new mechanism the variances of the fields grow significantly larger before the
production is shut off by the backreaction of the created particles. We also
find that heavy particles are produced much more efficiently with negative
coupling, which is of prime importance for GUT baryogenesis. Using a simple toy
model for baryogenesis and the results of our lattice simulations we show that
for natural values of the cross-coupling enough 10^{14}GeV bosons are created
to produce a baryon to entropy ratio consistent with observation. For positive
coupling the value of the cross-coupling required to produce such massive
particles is unnaturally large. In addition to our numerical results we obtain

plasma is dominated by strong collinear divergences. As a consequence, it
appears that the effective theory based on the resummation of hard thermal
loops fails to handle properly these light-cone sensitive processes since some
formally higher order diagrams are in reality the dominant ones.

transition of a new kind. Formation and subsequent growth of Q-balls via the
charge accretion proceeds until the solitons reach a critical charge, at which
point it becomes energetically favorable for the Q-ball interior to expand
filling space with the true vacuum phase. Solitosynthesis can destabilize a
false vacuum even when the tunneling rate is negligible. In models with
low-energy supersymmetry, where the Q-balls associated with baryon and lepton
number conservation are generically present, solitosynthesis can precipitate
transitions between the vacua with different VEV's of squarks and sleptons.
