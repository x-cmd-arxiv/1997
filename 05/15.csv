above and below a cold accretion disk with a plane-parallel (slab) geometry,
similar to the model of Haardt and Maraschi. By Comptonizing the soft radiation
emitted by the accretion disk, the corona is responsible for producing the
high-energy component of the escaping radiation. Our models include the
reprocessing of radiation in the accretion disk. Here, the photons either are
Compton reflected or photo-absorbed, giving rise to fluorescent line emission
and thermal emission. The self-consistent coronal temperature is determined by
balancing heating (due to viscous energy dissipation) with Compton cooling,
determined using the fully relativistic, angle-dependent cross-sections. The
total opacity is found by balancing pair productions with annihilations. We
find that, for a disk temperature kT_bb \lta 200 eV, these coronae are unable
to have a self-consistent temperature higher than \sim 120 keV if the total
optical depth is \gta 0.2, regardless of the compactness parameter of the
corona and the seed opacity. This limitation corresponds to the angle-averaged
spectrum of escaping radiation having a photon index \gta 1.8 within the 5 keV
- 30 keV band. Finally, all models that have reprocessing features also predict
a large thermal excess at lower energies. These constraints make explaining the
X-ray spectra of persistent black hole candidates with ADC models very
problematic.

resolutions. Each simulation is based upon identical initial conditions, which
consist of Gaussian distributed initial density fluctuations that have an n=-1

to shock heating and adiabatic heating and cooling. The evolution is expected
to be self-similar in time, and under certain restrictions we identify the
expected scalings for many properties of the distribution of collapsed objects

masses, and mass and emission weighted temperatures scale quite reliably.
However, the density estimates in the central regions of these structures are
determined by the degree of numerical resolution. As a result, mean gas
densities and luminosities obey the expected scalings only when calculated
within a limited dynamic range in density contrast. The temperatures and
luminosities of the groups show tight correlations with the baryon masses,
which can be well-represented by power-laws. The Press-Schechter (PS)

fairly well, though it tends to overestimate the baryon masses. Combining the
PS mass distribution with the measured relations for T(M) and L(M) predicts the

discrepancies at high temperatures/luminosities. The three simulations agree
well for the properties of groups that are resolved by 32 or more particles.

Based on improved physics including OPAL opacities, we confirm the existence of

analytical understanding of the main characteristics of the SBP phenomenon.
  The SBP is slow because it is a slow evolving helium-shell-burning phase
which is analogous to the early AGB phase. The SBP of a more metal-rich star is
slower than a metal-poor counterpart if their Teff's are the same because a
more metal-rich helium-burning star has a smaller mass than a metal-poor one
and because lifetime increases as mass decreases. Metal-rich helium-burning
stars easily become hot because the luminosity from the hydrogen-burning shell
is extremely sensitive to the mean molecular weight whereas the luminosity from
the helium-burning core is not. We suggest that the SBP phenomenon is a major
cause of the UV upturn phenomenon in giant elliptical galaxies as will be shown
in subsequent papers. The new HB tracks can be retrieved from S.Y.'s web site

transition temperature. The temperature variation of spin susceptibility,
electrical resistivity, specific heat, and NMR relaxation rates at low
temperatures is calculated in the limit of infinite exchange enhancement within
the frame work of a self consistent spin fluctuation theory. The resulting
non-Fermi liquid behavior is due to the presence of the low lying critically
damped spin fluctuations in these systems. The theory presented here gives the
leading low temperature behavior, as it turns out that the fluctuation
correlation term is always smaller than the mean fluctuation field term in
three as well as in two space dimensions. A comparison with illustrative
experimental results of these properties in some typical systems has been done.

shown that the magnitude of the calculated exchange force is of the order of
$10^{-9} $N at $d/a < 1$ and of the order of $10^{-10} $N at $1 < d/a < 1.5$,
where $d$ denotes the distance between surfaces of the two thin films and $a$
the lattice constant of bulk Fe. The obtained forces are sufficiently larger
than the sensitivity of the current atomic force microscopy of $10^{-12} -
10^{-13}$N, which suggests the feasibility of the exchange force microscopy.

Landau level approximation to the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. Both
the static and time-dependent density-density correlation functions of the
superconducting order parameter have been investigated. As the temperature is
lowered the correlation length, the length-scale over which the vortices have
short-range crystalline order, increases but the introduction of quenched
random disorder reduces this correlation length. We see no signs of a phase
transition in either the pure or the disordered case. For the disordered system
there is no evidence for the existence of a Bragg glass phase with quasi
long-range correlations. The dynamics in both the pure and disordered systems
is activated, and the barrier of the relaxation mechanism grows linearly with
the correlation length. The self-diffusion time scale of the vortices was also
measured and has the same temperature dependence as that of the longest time
scales found in the time dependent density-density correlation function. The
dominant relaxation mechanism observed is a change in orientation of a
correlated region of size of the correlation length. A scaling argument is
given to explain the value of the barrier exponent.

evaluating R, $R_{\tau}$ from a weighted contour integration of

difference between the R, $R_{\tau}$ constructed using the NNLO and ""leading-b""

the uncalculated higher order corrections. Simple numerical parametrizations
are given to facilitate these fits. For $R_{\tau}$ we estimate an uncertainty
$\delta\alpha_{s}(m_{\tau}^{2})\simeq0.01$, corresponding to
$\delta\alpha_{s}(M_{Z}^{2})\simeq0.002$. This encouragingly small uncertainty
is much less than rather pessimistic estimates by other authors based on
analogous all-orders resummations, which we demonstrate to be extremely
dependent on the chosen renormalization scheme, and hence misleading.

All these logics avoid arbitrary choice. Here we attempt to capture the

complex s-times (hep-th/9707206) is applied to an operator that generates
Bernoulli numbers B_n (Math. Mag. 70(1), 51 (1997)). B_n and Bernoulli
polynomials B_n(s) are analytic continued to B(s) and B_s(z). A new formula for
the Riemann zeta function zeta(s) in terms of nested series of zeta(n) is
derived. The new concept of dynamics of the zeros of analytic continued
polynomials is introduced, and an interesting phenonmenon of `scatterings' of
the zeros of B_s(z) is observed.

A 55 (June)",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.55.4438",,"quant-ph",,"  Raman-type laser excitation of a trapped atom allows one to realize the
quantum mechanical counterpart of phenomena of nonlinear optics, such as
Kerr-type nonlinearities, parametric amplification, and multi-mode mixing.
Additionally, huge nonlinearities emerge from the interference of the atomic
wave function with the laser waves. They lead to a partitioning of the phase
space accompanied by a significantly different action of the time evolution in
neighboring phase-space zones. For example, a nonlinearly modified coherent
""displacement"" of the motional quantum state may induce strong amplitude
squeezing and quantum interferences.

Rev. A 56 (Aug)",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1205",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a method for measuring entangled vibronic quantum states of a
trapped atom. It is based on the nonlinear dynamics of the system that appears
by resonantly driving a weak electronic transition. The proposed technique
allows the direct sampling of a Wigner-function matrix, displaying all knowable
information on the quantum correlations of the motional and electronic degrees
of freedom of the atom. It opens novel possibilities for testing fundamental
predictions of the quantum theory concerning interaction phenomena.
