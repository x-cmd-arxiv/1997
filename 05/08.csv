describe the specific integrable systems used, and include a detailed study of
the applications to quantum field theory.

stars and dust in starburst galaxies and applied it to 30 observed starburst
spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The starburst model was constructed by
combining two stellar evolutionary synthesis models with a model describing the
radiative transfer of stellar photons through dust. The stellar evolutionary
synthesis models were used to compute the dust-free SEDs for stellar
populations with ages between 1x10^6 and 15x10^9 years. Using a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer model, the effects of dust were computed for average Milky
Way (MW) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) dust, two different star/dust
geometries, and locally homogeneous or clumpy dust. Using color-color plots,
the starburst model was used to interpret the behavior of 30 starbursts with
aperture-matched UV and optical SEDs (and IR for 19 of the 30) from previous
studies. From the color-color plots, it was evident that the dust in starbursts
has an extinction curve lacking a 2175 A bump, like the SMC curve, and a steep
far-UV rise, intermediate between the MW and SMC curves. The star/dust geometry
which is able to explain the distribution of the 30 starbursts in various
color-color plots has an inner dust-free sphere of stars surrounded by an outer
star-free shell of clumpy dust. When combined with other work from the
literature on the Orion region and the 30 Dor region of the Large Magellanic
Cloud, this work implies a trend in dust properties with star formation
intensity.

  Workshop, RIKEN Institute, Tokyo Japan March 3-5, 1997",,,"LAUR 97-1675","astro-ph",,"  In many models of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) relativistic shells are responsible
for the overall envelope of emission. We use kinematics and symmetry to
calculate the time history and spectral evolution expected from a relativistic
shell including effects from intrinsic variations in the shell's intensity and
spectra. We find that the decay phase of an envelope is produced by photons
delayed by the shell's curvature. These delayed photons are produced by regions
that are off-axis such that the spectra evolve according to a universal
function (T^{-1}) regardless of intrinsic variations in the rest frame of the
shell. We compare our predictions to the overall envelope of emission of GRBs.
The observed spectra evolve faster. Intrinsic variations cannot make the
spectra evolve that fast, which adds strength to the ``shell symmetry''
problem: models, in particular, the external shock model, that involve
relativistic shells must either confine the material to narrow pencil beams, be
very inefficient, or break the local spherical symmetry so that the shell acts
like a parallel slab. In the case of the internal shock models involving winds
(i.e., central engines), it will probably be easier to break the local
spherical symmetry, but then one must postulate nearly continuous energy
generation at 10^{51} erg s^{-1} lasting up to hundreds of seconds at the

B (1997)",,"10.1142/S0217979297001039",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft",,"  The electron-phonon interaction in $C_{70}$ anions is studied by making use
of a lattice relaxation approach. We find there exists a Jahn-Teller effect in
$C_{70}^{3-}$ system, due to an extra electron being doped to the double
degenerate $E_{1}^{''}$ state. As a result of this effect, the original
$D_{5h}$ symmetry of the ground state becomes unstable, which causes distortion
of the lattice configuration. The only symmetry maintained in the final state
of the relaxation is the $x-y$ plane reflection symmetry. We further find that
besides the Jahn-Teller active $A_{1}^{'}, A_{2}^{'}, E_{2}^{'}$ modes, the
non-Jahn-Teller active $E_{1}^{'}$ vibrations also contribute to the relaxation
process, which come from the nonlinear effect and are two or three orders
smaller than those of the Jahn-Teller active modes. We suggest that the
$C_{70}^{3-}$ molecule is a promising Berry Phase candidate in this effective
$E \otimes e$ Jahn-Teller system.

Kam","Royce Kam and Herbert Levine","Unicellular algal growth: A biomechanical approach to cell wall dynamics","5 pages, 2 embedded figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.4290",,"patt-sol nlin.PS q-bio",,"  We present a model for unicellular algal growth as motivated by several
experiments implicating the importance of calcium ions and ``loosening''
enzymes in morphogenesis. A growing cell at rest in a diffusive calcium
solution is viewed as an elastic shell on short timescales. For a given turgor
pressure, we calculate the stressed shapes of the wall elements whose elastic
properties are determined by Young's modulus and the thickness of the wall. The
local enzyme concentration then determines the rate at which the unstressed
shape of a wall element relaxes toward its stressed shape. The local wall
thickness is calculated from the calcium-mediated addition of material and
thinning due to elongation. We use this model to calculate growth rates for
small perturbations to a circular cell. We find an instability related to
modulations of the wall thickness, leading to growth rates which peak at a
finite wave number.

generalisation of integral relations for classical special functions of one
variable. The approach is illustrated by giving a new proof of the
``quadratic'' integral relations for the continuous q-ultraspherical
polynomials. The separating integral operator M expressed in terms of the
Askey-Wilson operator is studied in detail: apart from writing down the
characteristic (``separation'') equations it satisfies, we find its spectrum,
eigenfunctions, inversion, invariants (invariant q-difference operators), and
give its interpretation as a fractional q-integration operator. We also give
expansions of the A1 Macdonald polynomials into the eigenfunctions of the
separating operator M and vice versa.

associated with first order poles of the analytically continued S-matrix can be
described by Gamow vectors which are generalized vectors with exponential decay
and a Breit-Wigner energy distribution. This mathematical formalism can be
generalized to quasistationary systems associated with higher order poles of
the S-matrix, which leads to a set of Gamow vectors of higher order with a
non-exponential time evolution. One can define a state operator from the set of
higher order Gamow vectors which obeys the exponential decay law. We shall
discuss to what extend the requirement of an exponential time evolution
determines the form of the state operator for a quasistationary microphysical
system associated with a higher order pole of the S-matrix.

eigenvalue (E_R-i\Gamma/2). The Gamow-Jordan vectors are elements of a
generalized complex eigenvector expansion, whose form suggests the definition
of a state operator (density matrix) for the microphysical decaying state of
this higher order pole. This microphysical state is a mixture of non-reducible
components. In spite of the fact that the k-th order Gamow-Jordan vectors has
the polynomial time-dependence which one always associates with higher order
poles, the microphysical state obeys a purely exponential decay law.
