definitely point toward the existence of stars and even of entire galaxies made
of anti-matter. The presence of anti-nuclei in cosmic rays has actually
profound implications on the fundamental question of the baryon asymmetry of
the universe. It is therefore crucial to determine the amount of anti-matter
which our own galaxy already produces through the spallation of high-energy
protons on the interstellar gas of the galactic disk. We have used here a
coalescence model to assess the amount of anti-deuterium and anti-helium 3
present in cosmic rays together with anti-protons. The propagation of cosmic
rays in the galaxy is described through a two-zone diffusion model which
correctly describes the observed abundances. We find that the
antideuterium/proton ratio exceeds $10^{-9}$ above a momentum per anti-nucleon
of about 4 GeV/c. Would the universe be purely made of matter, the AMS
collaboration should be able to detect a few anti-deuterons during the space
station stage of the experiment. However, the antihelium3/proton abundance does
not exceed $4 10^{-13}$. Heavier anti-nuclei are even further suppressed.

absorption cross-section using detailed gas dynamical simulations of a
``standard'' cold dark matter (CDM) model. Because of this calibration, our
approach makes more realistic assumptions about the absorption properties of
collapsed objects than previous, analytic calculations of the damped
Lyman-alpha abundance. CDM models with Omega_0=1, H_0=50, baryon density
Omega_b=0.05, and scale-invariant primeval fluctuations reproduce the observed
incidence and redshift evolution of damped Lyman-alpha absorption to within
observational uncertainty, for both COBE normalization (sigma_8=1.2) and a
lower normalization (sigma_8=0.7) that better matches the observed cluster

absorption, especially at z=4. With COBE normalization, a CDM model with
Omega_0=0.4, Omega_{Lambda}=0.6 gives an acceptable fit to the observed
absorption; an open CDM model is marginally acceptable if Omega_0 is at least
0.4 and strongly inconsistent with the z=4 data if Omega_0=0.3. Mixed dark
matter models tend not to produce sufficient absorption, being roughly
comparable to tilted CDM models if Omega_{nu} = 0.2 and failing drastically if

the range M(bj)=-18 to -21, for a composite sample of 22 of the richer clusters
that has M*=-20.16+/-0.02 and alpha=-1.22+/-0.04. The dominant error in these
values results from the choice of background subtraction method. From extensive
simulations we can show that when the LF is fitted over this narrow range, it
is difficult to discriminate against bright values of M*in the single cluster
fits, but that faint values provide a strong test of the universality of the
luminosity function. We find that all the individual cluster data are well fit
by a Schechter function with alpha fixed at -1.25, and that <=10% of these have
fitted values of M* that disagree from the average at the 99% confidence level.
We further show that fitting only a single parameter Schechter function to
composite subsets of the data can give erroneous results for the derived M*. By
considering two parameter fits, the results of Monte-Carlo simulations and
direct two-sample chi-squared tests we conclude that there is only weak
evidence for differences between the data when broken down into subsets based
on physical properties (Bautz-Morgan class, richness, velocity dispersion):
from our simulations, only the evidence for a difference between subsets based
on velocity dispersion may in fact be significant. We find no evidence at all
that a Schechter function is not a good model for the intrinsic cluster
luminosity function over this absolute magnitude range. Models that invoke
strong evolution of galaxy luminosity of all galaxies within clusters are

collisionless gravitating system of particles in an expanding universe can be
cast in a form which is almost independent of the cosmological density
parameter, $\Omega$, and the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. The new
equations are expressed in terms of a time variable $\tau\equiv \ln D$, where
$D$ is the linear rate of growth of density fluctuations. The weak dependence
on the density parameter is proportional to $\epsilon=\Omega^{-0.2}-1$ times
the difference between the peculiar velocity (with respect to $\tau$) of
particles and the gravity field. In the general case, the effect of this weak
$\Omega$ dependence is to enhance the rate of evolution of density
perturbations in dense regions. In a flat universe with $\Lambda\ne 0$, this
enhancement is less pronounced than in an open universe with $\Lambda=0$ and
the same $\Omega$. Using the spherical collapse model, we find that the
increase of the $rms$ density fluctuations in a low $\Omega$ universe relative
to that in a flat universe with the same linear normalization is $\sim 0.01
\epsilon(\Omega) < \delta^3 >$, where $\delta$ is the density field in the flat
universe. The equations predict that the smooth average velocity field scales
like $\Omega^{0.6}$ while the local velocity dispersion (rms value) scales,
approximately, like $\Omega^{0.5}$. High resolution N-body simulations confirm
these results and show that density fields, when smoothed on scales slightly
larger than clusters, are insensitive to the cosmological model. Halos in an
open model simulation are more concentrated than halos of the same $M/\Omega$

were performed: subdivision of the field and tests using simulated data with
randomized ellipticity orientation; using the pixel-to-pixel autocorrelation

the typical angular separation that dominates the signal. We find that the
field of PKS1508-05 contains a robust shear signal that is coherent over the 2'

a Goldstone boson exchange interaction between quarks. The six-quark harmonic
oscillator basis contains up to two excitation quanta. We show that the highly
dominant configuration is $\mid s^4p^2[42]_O [51]_{FS}>$ due to its specific
flavour-spin symmetry. Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation we find a
strong effective repulsion at zero separation between nucleons in both $^3S_1$
and $^1S_0$ channels. The symmetry structure of the highly dominant
configuration implies the existence of a node in the S-wave relative motion
wave function at short distances. The amplitude of the oscillation of the wave
function at short range will be however strongly suppressed. We discuss the
mechanism leading to the effective short-range repulsion within the chiral
constituent quark model as compared to that related with the one-gluon exchange
interaction.

isothermal autocatalytic chemical reaction involving both a quadratic (A + B ->

the ratio D = D_B/D_A of the diffusion constants of the reactant A and the
autocatalyst B, and the relative activity k of the cubic reaction. First, for
all values of D > 0 and k >= 0, we prove the existence of a family of
propagating fronts (or travelling waves) describing the advance of the
reaction. In particular, in the quadratic case k=0, we recover the results of
Billingham and Needham [BN]. Then, if D is close to 1 and k is sufficiently
small, we prove using energy functionals that these propagating fronts are
stable against small perturbations in exponentially weighted Sobolev spaces.
This extends to our system part of the stability results which are known for
the scalar Fisher equation.

unrelated theories: the theory of skein modules of 3-manifolds and the theory
of representations of groups into special linear groups of 2 by 2 matrices.
  Let R be a ring with an invertible element A. For any 3-manifold M one can
assign an R-module called the Kauffman bracket skein module of M. If A^2=1 then
this module has a structure of an R-algebra. We investigate this structure and,
in particular, we prove that if R is the field of complex numbers then this
algebra is isomorphic to the (unreduced) coordinate ring of the SL_2-character
variety of pi_1(M). Using that result we develop a theory of Sl_2-character
varieties by use of topological methods.
  We also assign to any surface a relative Kauffman bracket skein algebra. We
prove several results about this non-commutative algebra.
  Our work should be considered in the context of the book of Brumfiel and
Hilden `SL(2) Representations of Finitely Presented Groups,' Cont. Math 187. In
particular we give a topological interpretation to algebraic objects considered
in that book.

equation that models the $n+\alpha$ system in the framework of the resonating
group method. In two dimensions we consider the well studied Henon-Heiles
Hamiltonian and in three dimensions the model problem of three coupled
anharmonic oscillators. The method in all of the treated cases proved to be
highly accurate, robust and efficient. Hence it is a promising tool for
tackling problems of higher complexity and dimensionality.
