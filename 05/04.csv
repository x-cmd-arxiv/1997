B15",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.55.16198",,"cond-mat",,"  A theory of the free induction signal from biexcitons and bound excitons is
presented. The simultaneous existence of the exciton continuum and a bound
state is shown to result in a new type of time dependence of the free
induction. The optically detected signal increases in time and oscillates with
increasing amplitude until damped by radiative or dephasing processes.
Radiative decay is anomalously fast and can result in strong picosecond pulses.
The expanding area of a coherent exciton polarization (inflating antenna),
produced by the exciting pulse, is the underlying physical mechanism. The
developed formalism can be applied to different biexciton transients.

Hubbard model obtained by Quantum-Monte-Carlo simulations with results from
exact and stochastic diagonalizations. We find good agreement for the ground
state energy and superconducting correlations for both, the repulsive and
attractive Hubbard model. Special emphasis lies on the superconducting
correlations in the repulsive Hubbard model, where the small magnitude of the
values obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations gives rise to the question, whether
these results might be caused by fluctuations or systematic errors of the
method. Although we notice that the Quantum-Monte-Carlo method has convergence
problems for large interactions, coinciding with a minus sign problem, we
confirm the results of the diagonalization techniques for small and moderate
interaction strengths. Additionally we investigate the numerical stability and
the convergence of the Quantum-Monte-Carlo method in the attractive case, to
study the influence of the minus sign problem on convergence. Also here in the
absence of a minus sign problem we encounter convergence problems for strong
interactions.

transitions which scatter atoms between the condensate and non-condensate atom
fractions. For a range of condensate phase differences there is destructive
quantum interference of the amplitudes for scattering atoms out of the
condensates. Because the total atom scattering rate into the condensates is
unaffected the condensates grow. This mechanism is analogous to that
responsible for optical lasing without inversion. Growth using macroscopic
quantum interference may find application as a pump for an atom laser.

"dg-ga/9705003","Leonid Polterovich","Leonid Polterovich","Symplectic aspects of the first eigenvalue","LATEX, 18 pages",,,,"dg-ga math.DG",,"  There are two themes in the present paper. The first one is spelled out in
the title, and is inspired by an attempt to find an analogue of Hersch-Yang-Yau
estimate for $lambda_1$ of surfaces in symplectic category. In particular we
prove that every split symplectic manifold $T^4 times M$ admits a compatible
Riemannian metric whose first eigenvalue is arbitrary large. On the other hand
for Kahler metrics compatible with a given integral symplectic form an upper
bound for $lambda_1$ does exist. The second theme is the study of Hamiltonian
symplectic fibrations over the 2-sphere. We construct a numerical invariant
called the size of a fibration which arises as the solution of certain
variational problems closely related to Hofer's geometry, K-area and coupling.
In some examples it can be computed with the use of Gromov-Witten invariants.
The link between these two themes is given by an observation that the first
eigenvalue of a Riemannian metric compatible with a symplectic fibration admits
a universal upper bound in terms of the size.

Wilson lines over a small neighborhood and then projecting the average to +/-1
according to whether the neighborhood is ordered or disordered. The effective
Ising action, determined via the lattice Schwinger-Dyson equations, contains
even (two-spin) and odd (one- and three-spin) terms with short range. We find
that the truncation to Ising degrees of freedom produces an effective action
which is discontinuous across the gauge theory's phase transition. This
discontinuity may disappear if the effective action is made more elaborate.

systematic errors due to quasiergodicity. Substantial discrepancies between the
J-walking results and those obtained using standard Metropolis methods were
found. Results obtained using the atom-exchange method, another Monte Carlo
variant for multi-component systems, also did not compare well with the

different than that seen in homogenous clusters is also presented.
