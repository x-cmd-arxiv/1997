cosmic microwave background. Usually, this effect is thought of as a small
second-order effect that mildly alters the statistics of the microwave
background fluctuations. We show that there is a first-order effect that is
potentially observable if we combine microwave background maps with large
redshift surveys. We introduce a new quantity that measures this lensing
effect, $< T(\delta \theta \cdot \nabla T) >$, where T is the microwave
background temperature and $\delta \theta$ is the lensing due to matter in the
region probed by the redshift survey. We show that the expected signal is first
order in the gravitational lensing bending angle, $< (\delta \theta)^2
>^{1/2}$, and find that it should be easily detectable, (S/N) $\sim$ 15-35, if
we combine the Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite and Sloan Digital Sky
Survey data. Measurements of this cross-correlation will directly probe the
``bias'' factor, the relationship between fluctuations in mass and fluctuations
in galaxy counts.

distribution of the very faint galaxies allows now to put constrains on the

these small systems has to proceed in a gentle way, i.e. through episodes each
one lasting much longer than a simple instantaneous burst of star formation. By
allowing dwarfs to form stars in this gentle way the number of predicted red
remnants is severely reduced, in good agreement with the observations. Then, if
the faint counts are to be fitted by means of dwarfs, the simple model for
dwarfs forming stars in single, very short episodes is challenged, and a more
complex star formation history has to be invoked. Recent observational evidence
supporting this new dwarf models are also discussed.

between bonded monomers. For this we use a new algorithm, the ""Pruned-Enriched
Rosenbluth Method"" (PERM). It is very efficient both for relatively open
configurations at high temperatures and for compact and frozen-in low-T states.
This allows us to study in detail the phase diagram as a function of
nn-attraction epsilon and stiffness x. It shows a theta-collapse line with a
transition from open coils to molten compact globules (large epsilon) and a
freezing transition toward a state with orientational global order (large
stiffness x). Qualitatively this is similar to a recently studied mean field
theory (Doniach et al. (1996), J. Chem. Phys. 105, 1601), but there are
important differences. In contrast to the mean field theory, the
theta-temperature increases with stiffness x. The freezing temperature
increases even faster, and reaches the theta-line at a finite value of x. For
even stiffer chains, the freezing transition takes place directly without the
formation of an intermediate globule state. Although being in contrast with
mean filed theory, the latter has been conjectured already by Doniach et al. on
the basis of low statistics Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we discuss the
relevance of the present model as a very crude model for protein folding.

the scalar theory at finite temperature. The derivative of the effective
potential with respect to the mass square is expressed in terms of the full
propagator. Under a certain approximation this expression reduces to the
partial differential equation for the effective potential. We numerically solve
the partial differential equation and obtain the effective potential
non-perturbatively. It is found that the phase transition is of the second
order. The critical exponents calculated in this method are consistent with the
results obtained in Landau approximation.

inflating Universe. We consider gravitational wave modes in the FRW metrics in
a de Sitter phase and show that the vacuum is a two-mode SU(1,1) squeezed state
of thermo field dynamics, thus exhibiting the link between inflationary
evolution and thermal properties. In particular we discuss the entropy and the
free energy of the system. The state space splits into many unitarily
inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations
parametrized by time $t$ and non-unitary time evolution is described as a
trajectory in the space of the representations: the system evolves in time by
running over unitarily inequivalent representations. The generator of time
evolution is related to the entropy operator. A central ingredient in our
discussion is the doubling of the degrees of freedom which turns out to be the
bridge to the unified picture of non-unitary time evolution, squeezing and
thermal properties in inflating metrics.

other QCD calculations. This is because, due to the constraint of Gauss' law
applied to the wavefunctional, transverse gluons (which contribute the 1/3) are

artificial neural networks. A trial solution of the differential equation is
written as a sum of two parts. The first part satisfies the boundary (or
initial) conditions and contains no adjustable parameters. The second part is
constructed so as not to affect the boundary conditions. This part involves a
feedforward neural network, containing adjustable parameters (the weights).
Hence by construction the boundary conditions are satisfied and the network is
trained to satisfy the differential equation. The applicability of this
approach ranges from single ODE's, to systems of coupled ODE's and also to
PDE's. In this article we illustrate the method by solving a variety of model
problems and present comparisons with finite elements for several cases of
partial differential equations.

cannot be used to simulate a communication channel, it can reduce the

that, for a particular function among three parties (each of which possesses
part of the function's input), a prior quantum entanglement enables them to
learn the value of the function with only three bits of communication occurring
among the parties, whereas, without quantum entanglement, four bits of
communication are necessary. We also show that, for a particular two-party
probabilistic communication complexity problem, quantum entanglement results in
less communication than is required with only classical random correlations
(instead of quantum entanglement). These results are a noteworthy contrast to
the well-known fact that quantum entanglement cannot be used to actually
simulate communication among remote parties.

of the approximate phase operators on finite dimensional spaces proposed by
Pegg and Barnett. The spectral measure of this operator is a Naimark extension
of the optimal probability operator-valued measure for the phase parameter
found by Helstrom. Eventually, the two promising approaches to the statistics
of the phase in quantum mechanics is unified by means of the Hermitian phase
operator in the macroscopic extension of the Schroedinger representation.
