This type of approach has had some success in reproducing the optical

range. We estimate the IR/submm luminosities of ``luminous UV/IR galaxies'',
and we explore how much star formation could be hidden in
heavily--extinguished, ``ultraluminous IR galaxies'' by designing a family of
evolutionary scenarios which are consistent with the current status of the
``cosmic constraints'', as well as with the IRAS luminosity function and faint
counts, but with different high-z IR luminosity densities. However, these
scenarios generate a Cosmic Infrared Background whose spectrum falls within the
range of the isotropic IR component detected by Puget et al. (1996) and
revisited by Guiderdoni et al. (1997). We give predictions for the faint galaxy
counts and redshift distributions at IR and submm wavelengths. The submm range
is very sensitive to the details of the evolutionary scenarios. As a result,
the on-going and forthcoming observations with ISO and SCUBA (and later with
SIRTF, SOFIA, FIRST and PLANCK) will put strong constraints on the evolution of
galaxies at z=1 and beyond.

emission line clouds, as well as their possible effects on the observed spectra
of AGN. An important albedo source in moderately ionized ionization-bounded
clouds is that due to neutral hydrogen: Rayleigh scattering of continuum
photons off the extreme damping wings of Lya. The photons resulting from this
scattering mechanism may contribute significantly to the Lya emission line,
especially in the very broad wings. In addition, line photons emitted near 1200
Angstroms (e.g., N V 1240) that stream toward the neutral portion of the cloud
may be reflected off this Rayleigh scattering mirror, so that they
preferentially escape from the illuminated face. Inclusion of this effect can
alter predicted emission line strengths and profiles. In more highly-ionized
ionization-bounded clouds, Thompson scattering dominates the UV-optical albedo,
but this albedo is lessened by the hydrogen gas opacity. These clouds are most
reflective on the long wavelength side of the hydrogen recombination edges;
this feature may then alter the shapes of the spectral regions near the
recombination edges. We illustrate the effects of gas density and line
broadening on the effective albedo. We also discuss the reflection effects of
the accretion disk and the ``dusty torus.'' The accretion disk is an effective
reflector of UV-optical photons, whether by electron or Rayleigh scattering,
and it is possible that we observe a significant fraction of this light from
the AGN in reflection. This effect can alter the emission line profiles and
even destroy emission at the Lyman jump emitted by broad line clouds. Finally,
we discuss the possibility that continuum reflection from broad line clouds is
at least in part responsible for the polarized broad absorption line troughs.

the source passing near the small primary lens caustic to be small due to the
large distance of the perturbing planet, but this effect is overcome by the
high magnification. High magnification events are relatively rare (e.g. $\sim

either that the previous X-ray observations systematically overestimate the

their profile curvature and scalelength measurements are probably useful, their
total magnitude and central surface-brightness measurements are not useful for
the purpose of investigating scaling laws because they suffer from serious
systematic and random errors. We also investigate Binggeli & Jerjen's criti-

dependence between distance estimates based on the two different scaling laws
is invalid because of its prior assumption of negligible cluster depth. We
further demonstrate that the [relative] distance estimates on which their
kinematical arguments are based cannot be meaningful, not only because of the
seriousness of the photometric errors, but also because they are undermined by
the prior assumption that depth effects can again be neglected.

has to be very efficient and a kick velocity distribution has to contain a
significant contribution of low velocity kicks. The estimated age of the
population has to be between several 100 Myr and 1 Gyr. The birthrate of binary
neutron stars is about 3.4 10^{-5} per year (assuming 100% binarity) and their

addition, the effect of adjusting the width of the shear layer between the jet

  We find that, in general, cooling acts to: increase the level of mixing
between jet and ambient material through the `breaking' of KH induced waves on
the surface of the jet; increase the amount of momentum transferred from jet
material to ambient material; increase the time taken for shocks to develop in
the flow; reduce the strength of these shocks; reduce the rate of decollimation

magnetic impurity in the presence of the coupling between orbital moment of the
condensate and impurity spin S. Locally induced d_{xy} gap leads to the fully
gapped quasiparticle spectrum near impurity. The phase of the induced i d_{xy}
component is determined by impurity spin and averages to zero at high
temperatures. It is suggested that at low temperature the well defined patches
of d_{xy} are formed and they can undergo a phase transition into phase locked
state via Josephson effect. Violation of time-reversal symmetry and parity
occurs spontaneously via the second order transition. In the ordered phase both
impurity magnetization and d_{xy} component of the order parameter develop and
are proportional to each other.

measurements of electrical transport in a single-electron transistor made from
a colloidal nanocrystal of cadmium selenide. This device structure enables the

permits the measurement of the energy required for adding successive charge

Feynman x distributions in the study of photoproduction and hadronic production
of both J/Psi's and Drell-Yan dimuons is expatiated. The need to consider both
initial and final state interactions and the key effect of initial state
interactions on the total J/Psi cross section are demonstrated.
  We use a Woods-Saxon Monte Carlo simulation to obtain distributions of the
numbers of collisions prior and subsequent to the charmonium production. With
those results we relate the mean number of nucleon-nucleon collisions, $<n>$ to
$A^{1/3} + B^{1/3}$, and give a new analytic functional form for the A
dependence of the suppression.
  Finally we carry out a full Monte Carlo calculation of S, including an
initial state prior energy loss in keeping with the measured Feynman x
distributions in $\pi$-A and p-A interactions. We use an energy loss
parameterization which is consistent with the energy loss from minimum bias
data fitted in ISAJET. We also use an open charm absorption cross section,
$\sigma_{oc}$, constrained from photoproduction of J/Psi's, to analyze the
latest data on the J/Psi suppression. The role of color screening, the time
evolution of off-shell charmonium to the on-shell J/Psi, and the energy
dependence of the charmonium-nucleon inelastic and absorption cross sections
are discussed. We find no anomalous suppression when comparing our results to
published data.

QCD we explore the chemical-potential dependence of the dressed-quark
propagator, which provides a means of determining the behaviour of the chiral

coincident, first order deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration
transitions at \mu_c = 375 MeV. f_\pi is insensitive to \mu until \mu \approx
\mu_0 = 0.7 mu_c when it begins to increase rapidly. m_\pi is weakly dependent
on \mu, decreasing slowly with \mu and reaching a minimum 6% less than its
\mu=0 value at \mu=\mu_0. In a two-flavour free-quark gas at \mu=\mu_c the
baryon number density would be approximately 3 \rho_0, where \rho_0=0.16
fm^{-3}; while in such a gas at \mu_0 the density is \rho_0.

dilepton pair for each resonance can be decomposed in two components which
correspond to their decay 'inside' the target nucleus and in the vacuum,
respectively. The first components are strongly distorted by the nuclear medium
due to resonance-nucleon scattering and a possible mass shift at finite baryon
density. These medium modifications are compared to background sources in the
dilepton spectrum from $\pi N$ bremsstrahlung as well as the Dalitz decays of
$\omega$ and $\eta$ mesons produced in the reaction. Detailed predictions for
$\pi^- Pb$ reactions at 1.3 and 1.7 GeV/c are made within several momentum bins

of HCl dissociation strongly depends on its initial placement within the

into the surface. We observe that local melting does not play a crucial role in
