  Systems, eds. P. Petitjean & S. Charlot, Nouvelles Fronti\`eres, Paris",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Lyman-alpha forest lines in QSO spectra have typical widths of 20-50 km/s.
Low column density absorbers in cosmological simulations are large, diffuse
structures, and the Hubble flow across the spatially extended absorber is
usually the dominant contribution to the width of its associated absorption
line. Thermal broadening is unimportant over most of the spectrum, and peculiar
velocities tend to make absorption features narrower rather than broader. As a
consequence of Hubble flow broadening, there is a close relation between local
Lyman-alpha optical depth and local neutral hydrogen density, which is well
approximated by the Gunn-Peterson formula. The physics that governs the
unshocked intergalactic medium leads to a tight correlation between the neutral
hydrogen density and the underlying gas and dark matter overdensity. For many
purposes, it is simpler to regard a Lyman-alpha forest spectrum as a
continuous, non-linear map of the density field rather than a collection of
discrete lines. This continuous field view of the Lyman-alpha forest can be
applied to measurement of the baryon density parameter, testing of cosmological
models, and robust determination of the shape and amplitude of the primordial
mass power spectrum.

not, as they are derived from direct observations of distant galaxies in the
submillimetre waveband. The results have important consequences for the design

telescopes: the Planck Surveyor mission will be confusion-limited at
frequencies greater than 350 GHz, even in the absence of galactic dust
emission; 1-sigma confusion noise of 0.44 mJy/beam is expected for the

intermediate and less iron in the upper mass range of type II supernovae than
WW95-models. To investigate the significance of these discrepancies for
chemical evolution, we calculate Simple Stellar Population-yields for both sets
of models and different IMF slopes. We conclude that the Mg-yields of WW95 do
not suffice to explain the [Mg/Fe] overabundance neither in giant elliptical
galaxies and bulges nor in metal-poor stars in the solar neighbourhood and the
galactic halo. Calculating the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood
according to the standard infall-model (e.g. Matteucci & Greggio 1986; Timmes,
Woosley, & Weaver 1995; Yoshii, Tsujimoto, & Nomoto 1995), we find that using
WW95 and TNH96 nucleosynthesis, the solar magnesium abundance is underestimated

chemical evolution models by splitting the gas component into two different
phases. In additional simulations of the chemical evolution in the solar
neighbourhood, we discuss various timescales for the mixing of the stellar
ejecta with the interstellar medium. We find that a delay of the order of

short timescales for the debris to disperse (10^8 years). We predict that the

use numerical and analytical as well as analogue simulation methods to study
these systems. Then we point out how controlling of chaotic motions can be
effected by algorithmic procedures requiring minimal perturbations. Finally we
briefly discuss how synchronization of identically evolving chaotic systems can
be achieved and how they can be used in secure communications.

$\eta_n(R)$ that separate inertial from viscous behavior of many-point

$R$ of points in the correlation. This is a proposal of fundamental
significance in itself but it also has implications for the inertial range
scaling behaviour of various correlation functions. This dependence has never
been observed directly in laboratory experiments. In order to observe it,
turbulence data which both display a well-developed scaling range with clean
scaling behaviour and are well-resolved in the small scales to well within the
viscous range is required. We have analysed the data of the experiments
performed in the laboratory of P. Tabeling of Navier-Stokes turbulence in a

these criteria. We have been able to find strong evidence for the existence of
the predicted scaling of the viscous scale.

the mean field-like democratic fiber bundle model. In this model, fibers are
pulled with a force which is distributed uniformly. A fiber breaks if the
stress on it exceeds a threshold chosen from a probability distribution, and
the force is then redistributed over the intact fibers. Andersen et al. claim
the existence of a tricritical point, separating a ""first-order"" regime,
characterized by a sudden global failure, from a ""second-order"" regime,
characterized by a divergence in the breaking rate. We show that a first-order
transition is an artifact of a (large enough) discontinuity put by hand in the
disorder distribution. Thus, in generic physical cases, a first-order regime is
not present. This result is obtained from a graphical method, which, unlike
Andersen at al.'s analytical solution, enables us to distinguish the various
classes of qualitatively different behaviors of the model.

expression for the relaxation rate in terms of fundamental parameters of the

mass, $\bar{\omega}_0$ is the measured frequency, $A_c$ is the overlayer

structure. Protein crystallography is currently the most successful method for
determining the three-dimensional (3D) conformation of a protein, yet it
remains labor intensive and relies on an expert's ability to derive and
evaluate a protein scene model. In this paper, the problem of protein structure
determination is formulated as an exercise in scene analysis. A computational
methodology is presented in which a 3D image of a protein is segmented into a
graph of critical points. Bayesian and certainty factor approaches are
described and used to analyze critical point graphs and identify meaningful
substructures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Results of applying the
methodologies to protein images at low and medium resolution are reported. The
research is related to approaches to representation, segmentation and
classification in vision, as well as to top-down approaches to protein
structure prediction.

traversable wormhole throats. We discuss the violations of the energy
conditions that typically occur at and near the throat of any traversable
wormhole and emphasize the generic nature of this result. We discuss the
original Morris-Thorne wormhole and its generalization to a spherically
symmetric time-dependent wormhole, and also discuss spherically symmetric
Brans-Dicke wormholes. We also discuss the relationship with the topological
censorship theorem. Finally we turn to a rather general class of wormholes that
permit explicit analysis: generic static traversable wormholes (without any
symmetry). We define the wormhole throat in terms of a 2--dimensional
constant-time hypersurface of minimal area. (Zero trace for the extrinsic
curvature plus a ``flare--out'' condition.) This enables us to derive
generalized theorems regarding violations of the energy conditions---theorems
that do not involve geodesic averaging but nevertheless apply to situations
much more general than the spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne traversable
wormhole. [For example: the null energy condition (NEC), when suitably weighted
and integrated over the wormhole throat, must be violated.]

solution of the mu problem of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, has a
discrete Z_{3} symmetry which is spontaneously broken at the electroweak phase
transition, resulting in a cosmological domain wall problem. In most cases this
domain wall problem cannot be solved by explicit Z_{3} breaking without
introducing supergravity tadpole corrections which destabilize the weak scale
hierarchy. Here we consider the possibility of solving the domain wall problem
of the NMSSM via spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking occuring during
inflation. For the case where the discrete symmetry breaking field has
renormalizible couplings to the NMSSM fields, we find that the couplings must
be less than 10^{-5} if the reheating temperature is larger than 10^{7}GeV, but
can be up to 10^{-3} for reheating temperatures of the order of the electroweak
phase transition temperature. For the case of non-renormalizible couplings, we
present a model which can solve the domain wall problem for large reheating
temperatures without requiring any very small coupling constants.
  In this model the domain walls are eliminated by a pressure coming from their
interaction with a coherently oscillating scalar field whose phase is fixed
during inflation.
  This oscillating scalar field typically decays after the electroweak phase
transition but before nucleosynthesis, leaving no additional
  Z_{3} symmetry breaking in the zero-temperature theory.

generalizes the simplectic form and gives rise to a map between horizontal
forms playing the role of dynamical variables and vertical multivectors
generalizing Hamiltonian vector fields. Graded Poisson bracket is defined on
forms and leads to the structure of a Z-graded Lie algebra on the subspace of
the so-called Hamiltonian forms for which the map above exists. A generalized
Poisson structure arises in the form of what we call a ``higher-order'' and a
right Gerstenhaber algebra. Field euations and the equations of motion of forms
are formulated in terms of the graded Poisson bracket with the DW Hamiltonian
$n$-form $H\vol$ ($\vol$ is the space-time volume form and $H$ is the DW
Hamiltonian function). A few applications to scalar fields, electrodynamics and

$^{12}$C and photonenergies ranging from 100 up to 500 MeV. It is investigated
to which degree the two-nucleon emission reaction is dominated by
photoabsorption on $^3S_1(T=0)$ proton-neutron and $^1S_0(T=1)$ proton-proton
pairs in the nuclear medium. The calculations demonstrate that dominance of $S$
wave photoabsorption in the ($\gamma,pn$) channel does not necessarily imply
that the reaction mechanism is similar to what is observed in deuteron
photodisintegration.

experience to necessarily end up with a ""reduction of the wavefunction"". I will
consider the ""chain of reduction"" in detail -- from pure states of S&A (system
S and measuring apparatus A) via different kinds of mixtures to pure states of
A(S). It turns out that decoherence is not sufficient to explain reduction, but
that this can be done in terms of the concept of information within a
transcendental approach.

analog of the conditional probability which has been introduced in
[quant-ph/9512022]. The spectrum of the conditional operator characterizing a
quantum bipartite system is invariant under local unitary transformations and
reflects its inseparability. More specifically, it is shown that the
conditional amplitude operator of a separable state cannot have an eigenvalue
exceeding 1, which results in a necessary condition for separability. This
leads us to consider a related separability criterion based on the positive map
$\Gamma:\rho \to (Tr \rho) - \rho$, where $\rho$ is an Hermitian operator. Any
separable state is mapped by the tensor product of this map and the identity
into a non-negative operator, which provides a simple necessary condition for
separability. In the special case where one subsystem is a quantum bit,
$\Gamma$ reduces to time-reversal, so that this separability condition is
equivalent to partial transposition. It is therefore also sufficient for
$2\times 2$ and $2\times 3$ systems. Finally, a simple connection between this
map and complex conjugation in the ""magic"" basis is displayed.
