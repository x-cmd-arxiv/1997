families of space curves, which caracterizes the biliaison classes of curves.
First we introduce the concept of pseudo-isomorphism of coherent sheaves, which
generalizes the concept of stable isomorphism. An N-type resolution for a
family of curves $C$ over the local ring $A$, defined by an ideal $J$, is an
exact sequence $0\to P\to N\to J\to 0$ where $N$ is a locally free sheaf on
$P^3_A$ and $P$ is a direct sum of invertible sheaves $O_P(-n_i)$. We prove the
two following results, when the residual field of $A$ is infinite : 1. Let $C$
and $C'$ be two flat families of space curves over the local ring $A$. Then $C$
and $C'$ are in the same biliaison class if and only if their ideals $J$ and
$J'$ are pseudo-isomorphic, up to a shift. 2. Let $C$ and $C'$ be two flat
families of space curves over the local ring $A$, with N-type resolutions,
involving sheaves $N$ and $N'$. Then $C$ and $C'$ are in the same biliaison

  of non-thermal protons extended, updated references, figure added",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Two-temperature advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) or hot ion tori
(HIT) models help explain low luminosity stellar and galactic accreting sources
and may complement observational support for black holes in nature. But low
radiative efficiencies demand that ions receive a fraction $\eta \gsim 99%$ of
energy dissipated in the turbulent accretion. The $\eta$ depends on the ratio
of particle to magnetic pressure. If compressive modes of dissipation, like
magnetic mirroring, dominate incompressible modes, then even when the pressure
ratio is O(1), the required large $\eta$ can be attained. However the relative
importance of compressive vs. incompressible modes is hard to estimate. The
larger up in the turbulent cascade, the more compressible the turbulence. The
relevant length scale for particle energization can be determined by equating
the dominant eddy turnover time to the time for which an energy equal to that
in the turbulence can be drained. Based on the large scales resulting from this
estimate, it is suggested that compressive mirroring may be important. Also,
regardless of the precise $\eta$ or dissipation mechanism, non-thermal protons
seem natural in two- temperature discs because all dissipation mechanisms, and
the use of an isotopic pressure, require wave-particle resonances that operate
only on a subset of the particles. Finally, it is briefly mentioned how
mirroring may help to generate an ADAF or HIT in the first place.

Therefore, blind radio spectroscopic surveys at frequencies of 400 to 1000 Mhz
can form an independent test of the galaxy merger rate as a function of time
over the redshift interval z = 4 to 0.7.
  The redshift range z = 0.17 to 0.4 will be difficult to survey for OH masers,
since spectroscopic survey signals will be confused with HI emission from
normal galaxies at redshifts less than 0.3. In fact, the signals from OH masers
are likely to dominate over 21cm line emission from normal galaxies at
frequencies below 1200 MHz (i.e. large redshifts z_HI > 0.18 and z_OH > 0.4).
Surveyors of nearby galaxies in the 21cm line may find that OH masers form a
contaminant to deep, blind HI surveys for redshift velocities less than a few
hundred kilometers per second. At frequencies just above 1420 MHz, sensitive
sky surveys might detect OH masers, which could be mistaken for a population of

possible existence of a population of relatively faint sources with hard X-ray
spectra; however, the emission mechanism remains unclear. If the hard X-ray
emission is from the radiatively inefficient, advection dominated accretion
flows (ADAFs) around massive black holes in galactic nuclei, X-ray luminosity
and radio luminosity satisfy the approximate relation $L_R\sim 7\times
10^{35}(\nu/15GHz)^{7/5}(M/10^7M_{\odot}) (L_x/10^{40} erg s^{-1})^{1/10} erg

is the mass of the accreting black hole, and $10^{40} \simle L_x\simle 10^{42}
erg s^{-1}$ is the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. These sources are characterized
by inverted radio spectra $I_\nu \propto \nu^{2/5}$. For example, an ADAF X-ray
source with luminosity $L_x\sim 10^{41} erg s^{-1}$ has a nuclear radio
luminosity of $\sim 4\times 10^{36}(M/3\times 10^7M_{\odot}) erg s^{-1}$ at
$\sim 20$ GHz and if at a distance of $\sim 10 (M/3\times 10^7M_{\odot})^{1/2}

($\sim 20 GHz$), high angular resolution radio observations provide an
important test of the ADAF emission mechanism. Since $L_R$ depends strongly on
black hole mass and only weakly on X-ray luminosity, the successful measurement
of nuclear radio emission could provide an estimate of black hole mass. Because
the X-ray spectra produced by ADAFs are relatively hard, sources of this
emission are natural candidates for contributing to the hard, $>2$ keV,
background.

and OAO 1657-415, can be explained by transition in accretion flow rotation
from Keplerian to sub-Keplerian, which takes place at a critical accretion
rate, $\sim 10^{16}-10^{17}g/s$. When a pulsar system spins up near equilibrium
spin before the transition, the system goes into spin-down after transition to
sub-Keplerian. If a system is well into the spin-up regime, the transition can
cause a sharp decrease in spin-up rate but not a sudden spin-down. These
observable types of abrupt torque change are distinguished from the smooth
torque variation caused by change of ${\dot M}$ in the Keplerian flow. The
observed abrupt torque reversal is expected when the pulsar magnetic field
$B_*\sim 5\times 10^{11}b_p^{-1/2}L_{x,36}^{1/2}P_{*,10}^{1/2}G$ where the
magnetic pitch parameter $b_p\sim$ a few, $L_{x,36}$ is the X-ray luminosity in
$10^{36} erg/s$, and $P_{*,10}$ is the pulsar spin period in 10s. Observed
quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) periods tightly constrain the model. For 4U

  Millisecond Pulsars from Accretion-Induced Collapse","10 pages, ApJ",,"10.1086/311192",,"astro-ph",,"  Cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be driven by dissipation of pure
electromagnetic energy (Poynting flux) extracted from rapidly rotating compact
objects with strong magnetic fields. One such possibility is a young
millisecond pulsar (MSP) formed from accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a
white dwarf. The combination of an efficient magnetic dynamo, likely operating
during the first seconds of the initially hot and turbulent MSP interior, and
the subsequent modest beaming of gamma-ray emitting outflows, would easily
account for energy constraints. But the remarkable feature of such models is
that they may naturally explain the hitherto unexplained bimodal distribution
in GRB time durations. The two burst classes could correspond to MSPs that form
spinning above and below a gravitationally unstable limit respectively. In the
former case, the spin-down time scale is due to gravitational radiation
emission ($<1s$) while the spin-down time scale of the latter is due to
electromagnetic dipole emission ($\gg 1s$). These two time scales account for
the short and long GRB durations, i.e. the observed bimodal GRB duration
distribution. A natural prediction is that the short duration GRBs would be
accompanied by strong gravitational radiation emission which is absent from the
longer class. Both would show millisecond variabilities.

zero and five core radii. It possesses a roughly isothermal core, with central
density and temperature twice the initial values. Outside the core the
temperature drops as r^-1, and the density roughly as r^-3.8. The core radius

3 in the CO J=3-2 line, with four new detections) with existing material (all

themselves by the presence of gas pressure inversions. Such inversions are not
an artifact of the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium but can also be
present in hydrodynamical model atmospheres. Only for very large mass loss
rates hardly realized in supergiants will the inversions be removed.
Instabilities may, however, still be present in such inversions, which is
investigated for both H-rich and H-deficient late-type supergiant model
atmospheres. A local, non-adiabatic, linear stability analysis reveals that
sound waves can be amplified due to the strong radiative forces. However,
despite the super-Eddington luminosities, the efficiency of the radiative
instabilities is fairly low compared to for early-type stars with growth rates
of $10^{-5} s^{-1}$.

necessary to use, in addition, the equations of thermal equilibrium along with
the input physics, such as opacities, equation of state and nuclear reaction
rates. It then becomes possible to estimate the effects of uncertainties in
opacity and nuclear reaction rates on the inferred thermal and composition
profiles. The seismically determined temperature and hydrogen abundance
profiles turn out to be close to those in a standard evolutionary solar model
that includes the diffusion of helium and heavy elements below the convection
zone. The most significant departure occurs just below the base of the
convection zone where the inferred hydrogen abundance profile is smoother than
that in a standard diffusion model. The region just beneath the solar
convection zone appears to be mixed, a process which could account for the
observed low lithium abundance in the solar envelope. With a reasonable
allowance for errors in opacities, the helioseismically estimated cross-section
for pp nuclear reaction rate turns out to be (4.15+/-0.25)*1.E-25 MeV barns.

from a completely independent method, a fact which provides persuasive evidence
that the Cepheid period-radius relation is now determined at a very high
confidence level. We use the accurate infrared distances to determine
period-luminosity relations in the V, I, J, H and K passbands from the Galactic
sample of Cepheids. We derive improved slopes of these relations from updated
LMC Cepheid samples and adopt these slopes to obtain accurate absolute

the morphology and scaling behavior are accessed by mean of a principle of

coupled saddle point field equations for the local slope and noise fields,
replacing the noisy Burgers equation, are solved yielding nonlinear localized
soliton solutions and extended linear diffusive mode solutions, describing the
morphology of a growing interface. The canonical formalism and the principle of
least action also associate momentum, energy, and action with a
soliton-diffusive mode configuration and thus provides a selection criterion
for the noise-induced fluctuations. In a ``quantum mechanical'' representation
of the path integral the noise fluctuations, corresponding to different paths
in the path integral, are interpreted as ``quantum fluctuations'' and the
growth morphology represented by a Landau-type quasi-particle gas of ``quantum
solitons'' with gapless dispersion and ``quantum diffusive modes'' with a gap
in the spectrum. Finally, the scaling properties are dicussed from a heuristic
point of view in terms of a``quantum spectral representation'' for the slope
correlations. The dynamic eponent z=3/2 is given by the gapless soliton
dispersion law, whereas the roughness exponent zeta =1/2 follows from a
regularity property of the form factor in the spectral representation. A
heuristic expression for the scaling function is given by spectral
representation and has a form similar to the probability distribution for Levy

complex conductivity \sigma_1-i\sigma_2 in the SC and AFM states. At radio
frequencies (4 MHz), the H and T dependence of the penetration depth
\lambda(T,H) were measured. The establishment of antiferromagnetic order at
T_N=10.3 K results in a marked decrease in the scattering of charge carriers,
leading to sharp decreases in R_s and X_s. However, R_s and X_s differ from
each other in the AFM state. We show that the results are consistent with
conductivity relaxation whence the scattering rate becomes comparable to the
microwave frequency. The rf measurements yield a rich dependence of the
scattering on the magnetic field near and below T_N. Anomalous decrease of
scattering at moderate applied fields is observed at temperatures near and
above T_N, and arises due to a crossover from a negative magnetoresistance
state, possibly associated with a loss of spin disorder scattering at low
fields, to a positive magnetoresistance state associated with the metallic
nature. The normal state magnetoresistance is positive at all temperatures for

boundary conditions to a $L \times \infty$ strip and diagonalize the
corresponding transfer matrix for a series of moderately large systems ($L \le
64$) by the DMRG method. The numerically very accurate finite lattice results
are then extrapolated by efficient sequence extrapolation techniques. The
critical density profiles and the Casimir amplitudes are found to follow
precisely the conformal predictions for Q=2 and 3. Similarly, the bulk and
surface critical exponents of the models are in very good agreement with the
conformal and exact values: their accuracy has reached or even exceeded the
accuracy of other available numerical methods. For the Q=4 model both the
profiles and the critical exponents show strong logarithmic corrections, which
are also studied.

levels behaves like 1/M. This sort of spectrum has also emerged in a variety of
formal approaches to black hole quantization by a number of workers (with some
notable exceptions). If true, this result indicates a distortion of the
semiclassical Hawking spectrum which could be observable even for macroscopic
black holes. Black hole entropy suggests that the mentioned mass levels should
be degenerate to the tune of an exponential in $M^2$, as first noted by
Mukhanov. This has implications for the statistics of the radiation. I also
discuss open questions: whether radiative decay will spread the levels beyond
recognition, whether extremal black holes can be described by this scheme, etc.

study a rich variety of astronomical systems whose gravitational radiation is
not detectable from the ground, because it is emitted in the low-frequency
gravitational wave band (0.1 mHz to 1 Hz) that is inaccessible to ground-based
detectors. Sources include binary systems in our Galaxy and massive black holes
in distant galaxies. The radiation from many of these sources will be so strong
that it will be possible to make remarkably detailed studies of the physics of
the systems. These studies will have importance both for astrophysics (most
notably in binary evolution theory and models for active galaxies) and for
fundamental physics. In particular, it should be possible to make decisive
measurements to confirm the existence of black holes and to test, with
accuracies better than 1%, general relativity's description of them. Other
observations can have fundamental implications for cosmology and for physical
theories of the unification of forces. In order to understand these
conclusions, one must know how to estimate the gravitational radiation produced
by different sources. In the first part of this lecture I review the dynamics
of gravitational wave sources, and I derive simple formulas for estimating wave
amplitudes and the reaction effects on sources of producing this radiation.

and the signal's polarisation. This requires pattern-matching, called matched
filtering, which uses the best available theoretical predictions about the
characteristics of waveforms. All the estimates of the sensitivity of LISA to
various sources assume that the data analysis is done in the optimum way.
Because these techniques are unfamiliar to many young physicists, I use the

limit exhibits a significant deviation from experimental values: with $K$ meson
mass to fix strange quark mass, strange meson and baryon masses are
systematically lower. Light quark masses determined from the axial Ward
identity are shown to agree with those from perturbation theory in the
continuum limit. Decay constants of mesons are also discussed.

such as e^+e^- -> t bar-t h, t bar-t Z and e^+e^- -> t bar-c \nu_e bar-\nu_e, t
bar-c e^+ e^- is discussed. Such, beyond the Standard Model, couplings can
occur already at the tree-level within a class of Two Higgs Doublets Models.
Therefore, an extremely interesting feature of those reactions is that the
CP-violating and flavor-changing effects are governed by tree-level dynamics.
These reactions may therefore serve as unique avenues for searching for new
phenomena associated with Two Higgs Doublets Models and, as is shown here,
could yield statistically significant signals of new physics. We find that the
CP-asymmetries in e^+e^- -> t bar-t h, t bar-t Z can reach tens of percents,
and the flavor changing cross-section of e^+e^- -> t bar-c \nu_e bar-\nu_e is
typically a few fb's, for light Higgs mass around the electroweak scale.

analyze the classical and hard thermal loop contributions to the self-energy

general properties of Dirac spectra and discuss the relation between chiral

focus on the microscopic spectral density density, i.e. the spectral density
near zero virtuality on the scale of a typical level spacing. The relation with
Leutwyler-Smilga sum-rules will be discussed. The success of applications of
RMT to spectra of 'complex' systems leads us to the introduction of a chiral
Random Matrix Theory (chRMT) with the global symmetries of the QCD partition
function. Our central conjecture is that it decribes correlations of QCD Dirac
spectra. We will review recent universality proofs supporting this conjecture.
Lattice QCD results for the microscopic spectral density and for correlations
in the bulk of the spectrum are shown to be in perfect agreement with chRMT. We
close with a review of chRMT at nonzero chemical potential. Novel features of
spectral universality in nonhermitean matrices will be discussed. As an

concepts of field theory are transparent in this picture, offering an
interpretation for global symmetries, local symmetries, the effective (running)
coupling, the Coulomb and Higgs branches, the monopole tensions, and the mass
of BPS particles. A rule for the dimension of the Coulomb branch is found by
introducing Grid Diagrams. Some known classifications of field theories are
reproduced. In addition to the study of the vacuum manifold we develop methods
to determine the BPS spectrum. Some states, such as quarks, correspond to
instantons inside the 5-brane which we call strips. In general, these may not
be identified with (p,q) strings. We describe how a strip can bend out of a
5-brane, becoming a string. A general BPS state corresponds to a Web of strings
and strips. For special values of the string coupling a few strips can combine
and leave the 5-brane as a string.

even with the global symmetries of the equations of motion. A striking
regularity is exhibited by the series of theories obtained respectively without
any dualisation, with the dualisation of only the Ramond-Ramond fields of the
type IIA theory, with full dualisation to lowest degree forms, and finally for
certain inverse dualisations (increasing the degrees of some forms) to give the
type IIB series. These theories may be called the GL_A, D, E and GL_B series

sigma models on the symmetric spaces K(E_{11-D})\backslash E_{11-D} (where K(G)
is the maximal compact subgroup of G) and the other three series lead to models
on homogeneous spaces K(G) \backslash G\semi \R^s. These can be understood from
the E series in terms of the deletion of positive roots associated with the
dualised scalars, which implies a group contraction. We also propose a
