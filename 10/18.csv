  Accepted, ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/311021",,"astro-ph",,"  Evidence supporting the hypothesis of an invariant stellar Initial Mass
Function is strong and varied. The intra-cluster medium in rich clusters of
galaxies is one of the few contrary locations where recent interpretations of
the chemical abundances have favoured an IMF that is biased towards massive
stars, compared to the `normal' IMF. This interpretation hinges upon the
neglect of Type Ia supernovae to the ICM enrichment, and a particular choice of
the nucleosynthesis yields of Type II supernovae. We demonstrate here that when
one adopts yields determined empirically from observations of Galactic stars,
rather than the uncertain model yields, a self-consistent picture may be
obtained with an invariant stellar IMF, and about half of the iron in the ICM
being produced by Type Ia supernovae.

images in the emission of Halpha and [S II], together with continuum images to
remove stellar confusion. After continuum subtraction, we discovered a network
of Halpha filaments reaching almost completely around the remnant. Most of the
newly identified filaments show no corresponding [S II] emission, indicating
that they belong to the peculiar ''Balmer-dominated'' class of filaments.
Comparison of these Balmer filaments with existing radio and X-ray images of
RCW 86 shows an overall similarity, although interesting differences are
apparent upon detailed inspection. While further observations of these newly
identified optical filaments may eventually provide more detailed information
on the kinematics and distance to RCW 86, the distance currently remains
uncertain. We argue that the shorter distance estimates of ~1 kpc are still
favored.

4472, cannot have been produced solely from gas expelled from galactic stars.
In traditional models for the evolution of hot interstellar gas (cooling flows)
in ellipticals, the galaxies are assumed to have been cleared of gas by
SNII-driven winds at some early time then gas is subsequently replenished by
mass loss from an evolving population of old stars. To test this, we accurately
determine the stellar and dark halo mass of NGC 4472 using hydrostatic
equilibrium, then solve the standard time-dependent cooling flow equations to
recover the observed hot gas temperature and density distributions when evolved
to the present time. This procedure fails: the computed gas density gradient is
too steep, the total gas mass is too low, and the gas temperatures are much too
low. All variants on this basic procedure also fail: increasing the SNIa rate,
using the mass dropout assumption, arbitrarily adjusting uncertain
coefficients, etc. However, agreement is achieved if the galaxy is supplied
with additional, spatially-extended hot gas early in its evolution. This old
``circumgalactic'' gas can be retained to the present time and may be related
to cosmological ``secondary infall''.

of 1D and 2D maps from the Poincare sections all unstable periodic orbits up to

auxiliary vector field. This formulation needs no constraint imposed on the
component field from outside, and a constraint on the Yang-Mills field is
generated as the field equation of the auxiliary vector field. The invariance
check of the action is also performed without any reference to constraints by

highly non-trivial extra symmetries. We couple this twelve-dimensional
supersymmetric Yang-Mills background to Green-Schwarz superstring, and confirm
fermionic kappa-invariance. As another improvement of this theory, we present a

expansion up to fairly high order for these gauge groups, e. g. eighth order
for SU(3). We find that after taking a derivative, the instanton expansion of
the pre-potential has integer coefficients. We also postulate the form of the
