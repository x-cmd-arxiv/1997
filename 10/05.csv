  Line Systems, eds. P. Petitjean & S. Charlot, Nouvelles Fronti\`eres, Paris",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The conditions for structure formation which ultimately lead to galaxies
request further ingredients behind the simple collapse criteria. The Jean's
criteria and the cooling criteria are those which are currently used. However
in such a simple scheme, a fundamental problem occurs in hierarchical pictures,
namely the OVERCOOLING: the predicted fraction of primordial gas expected to
have cooled in the history of structure formation is for too large. The
solution to this problem is likely to be a substantial re-heating phase. Here,
we discussed one possible solution: the warm IGM picture. If the feedback of
galaxy formation is able to heat the IGM up to temperatures of the order of
$10^5-10^6$ K, galaxy formation is inhibited on small mass scale. This leads to
an inverse hierarchical picture: most of the large galaxies form at redshifts
in the range 3 to 5, while small galaxies form at two different epoch: at an
early phase at redshift greater than five and at a late phase, between redshift
3 and 0. Such a scheme may reproduce quite well the amount of HI gas versus
redshift.

the ARNICA camera mounted on TIRGO as well as with an ESO NTT observation
carried out by Dr A. Moorwood. We detect a variety of transitions of hydrogen,
helium, OI, FeII, FeIII, and H_2 . From our molecular hydrogen data, we
conclude that densities are moderate (3-6 10^4 cm^-3) in the layer responsible
for the molecular hydrogen emission and give no evidence for the presence of
dense neutral clumps. We also find that the molecular hydrogen bar is likely to
be tilted by ~10 degrees relative to the line of sight. We discuss the relative
merits of several models of the structure of the bar and conclude that it may
be split into two structures separated by 0.2-0.3 parsec along the line of
sight. It also seems likely to us that in both structures, density increases
along a line perpendicular to the ionization front which penetrates into the
neutral gas.
  We have used the 1.317um OI line to estimate the FUV radiation field incident
at the ionization front and find values of 1-3x10^4 greater than the average
interstellar field. From [FeII] line measurements, we conclude that the
electron density in the ionized layer associated with the ionization front is
of order 10^4 cm^-3. Finally, our analysis of the helium and hydrogen
recombination lines implies essential coincidence of the helium and hydrogen
Stromgren spheres.

linear non-adiabatic oscillations of the Horizontal Branch (HB) stars, with
both the dynamic and thermodynamic coupling between convection and oscillations
carefully treated. Turbulent pressure and turbulent viscosity have been
included consistently in our equations of non-adiabatic pulsation. When the
coupling between convection and oscillations is ignored, for all models with
Teff <= 7350, the fundamental through the second overtone are pulsationally
unstable; while for Teff <= 6200 all the models are unstable up to (at least)
the 9th overtone. When the coupling between convection and oscillations is
included, the RR Lyrae instability strip is very well predicted. Within the
strip the most models are pulsationally unstable only for the fundamental and
the first few overtones. The turbulent viscosity is an important damping
mechanism. Being exclusively distinct from the luminous red variables (long
period variables), the HB stars to the right of the RR strip are pulsationally
stable for the fundamental and low-order overtones, but become unstable for
some oen of the high-order overtones. This may provide a valuable clue for the
short period, low amplitude red variables found outside the red edge of the RR
strip on the H-R diagram of globular clusters. Moreover, we present a new
radiation modulated excitation mechanism functioning in a zone of radiation
flux gradient. The effects of nonlocal convection and the dynamic coupling
between convection and oscillations are discussed. The spatial oscillations of
the thermal variables in the pulsational calculations have been effectively
suppressed.

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.57.3221",,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  The general equations of motion for two dimensional Laplacian growth are
derived using the conformal mapping method. In the singular case, all
singularities of the conformal map are on the unit circle, and the map is a
degenerate Schwarz-Christoffel map. The equations of motion describe the
motions of these singularities. Despite the typical fractal-like outcomes of
Laplacian growth processes, the equations of motion are shown to be not
particularly sensitive to initial conditions. It is argued that the sensitivity
of this system derives from a novel cause, the non-uniqueness of solutions to
the differential system. By a mechanism of singularity creation, every solution
can become more complex, even in the absence of noise, without violating the
growth law. These processes are permitted, but are not required, meaning the
equation of motion does not determine the motion, even in the small.

diagonal and off - diagonal spectral functions are constructed and evaluated

However, the presence of correlations modify the $BCS$ picture dramatically.
For example, due to the presence of correlations we have postulated a three -
pole ansatz for the diagonal Green function, $G(\vec{k},\omega)$, while the off
- diagonal one, $B(\vec{k},\omega)$, is supposed to have two poles. In the
paper we present results for the three spectral weights of the diagonal Green
function, $\alpha_j(\vec{k})$, j = 1,2,3. Our results compare reasonably well
with more elaborated auto - consistent highly non - linear equations (double
fluctuation calculations in the $T-$ Matrix approach of one of the authors).
Then, the physical picture which emerges is that the lower Hubbard band is
split due to the superconducting gap and the upper Hubbard band remains mostly
unmodified.

of $\Sigma(\vec{k},\omega)$. In order to find these two parameters we have used
the third and four sum rules of Nolting. $G(\vec{k},\omega)$ turns out to be
identical to the one of Nolting (Z. Physik 225, 25 (1972)), which is beyond a
Hubbard-I solution since satisfies four sum rules. With our proposal we have
been able to obtain an expansion in powers of $U$ for the self-energy (here to
second order in $U$). We present numerical results at half-filling for 1- the
static spin susceptibility, $\chi(T)$ vs $T/t$ and 2- the band narrowing
parameter, $B(T)$ vs $T/t$. The two-pole Ansatz of Nolting for the one-particle

remains the fundamental quantity for more elaborated calculations when, for
example, lifetime effects are included.

sum-rule channels which are likely to exhibit sensitivity to broad resonance

when one goes beyond the narrow resonance approximation to include possible
subcontinuum resonances with nonzero widths. We then show that the
corresponding first two finite energy sum rules are insensitive to the widths
of such resonances, provided their peaks are symmetric and entirely below the
continuum threshold. We also discuss the reduced sensitivity of the first two
finite energy sum rules to higher dimensional condensates, and show these sum
rules to be insensitive to dimension > 6 condensates containing at least one
q-bar q pair. We extract the direct single-instanton contribution to the F_1
sum rule for the longitudinal component of the axial-vector correlation
function from the known single-instanton contribution to the lowest Laplace sum
rule for the pseudoscalar channel. Finally, we demonstrate how inclusion of
this instanton contribution to the finite-energy sum rule leads to both a
lighter quark mass and to more phenomenologically reasonable higher-mass
resonance contributions within the pseudoscalar channel.
