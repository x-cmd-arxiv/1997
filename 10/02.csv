analytical investigation of this problem (Ciotti & Pellegrini 1996), we have
performed 2D numerical simulations of the gas flows inside S0 galaxies in order
to ascertain the effectiveness of rotation and/or galaxy flattening in reducing
the Lx/Lb ratio. The flow in models without SNIa heating is considerably
ordered, and essentially all the gas lost by the stars is cooled and
accumulated in the galaxy center. If rotation is present, the cold material
settles in a disk on the galactic equatorial plane. Models with a time
decreasing SNIa heating host gas flows that can be much more complex. After an
initial wind phase, gas flows in energetically strongly bound galaxies tend to
reverse to inflows. This occurs in the polar regions, while the disk is still
in the outflow phase. In this phase of strong decoupling, cold filaments are
created at the interface between inflowing and outflowing gas. Models with more
realistic values of the dynamical quantities are preferentially found in the
wind phase with respect to their spherical counterparts of equal Lb. The
resulting Lx of this class of models is lower than in spherical models with the
same Lb and SNIa heating. At variance with cooling flow models, rotation is
shown to have only a marginal effect in this reduction, while the flattening is
one of the driving parameters for such underluminosity, in accordance with the
analytical investigation.

  Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/305256",,"astro-ph",,"  Both the detection of galaxies and the derivation of the luminosity function
depend upon isophotal magnitudes, implicitly in the first case, and explicitly
in the latter. However, unlike perfect point sources, the fraction of a
galaxy's light contained within the limiting isophote is a function of
redshift, due to the combined effects of the point spread function and
cosmological dimming. This redshift variation in the measured isophotal
luminosity can strongly affect the derived luminosity function. Using
simulations which include the effects of seeing upon both disk and elliptical
galaxies, we explore the size of the systematic biases which can result from
ignoring the redshift variation in the fraction of detected light. We show that
the biases lead to underestimates in the normalization of the luminosity
function, as well as changes in shape. The size of the bias depends upon
redshift, and thus can mimic galaxy evolution. Surprisingly, these biases can
be extremely large without affecting <V/V_max>. However, these biases can be
detected in the full distribution of V/V_max, and in fact may have already been
detected in recent surveys. Because the systematic biases result from the
redshift variation in the fraction of lost light, the biases are not
significant when the fraction of lost light is always small over the entire
survey volume, for all galaxy types; however, modern surveys usually violate
these conditions. We show that the expected biases are not necessarily
eliminated when using aperture magnitudes, FOCAS ""total"" magnitudes, or Kron
magnitudes, but may be reduced if Petrosian magnitudes are used. These
considerations may also apply to samples of clusters selected in X-rays.

accelerated winds of OB stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, or luminous blue variables.
Instead of showing blob ejection, the whole wind of BZ Cam appears to turn on
and off. We use this to measure the acceleration law of a CV wind for the first
time. The velocity increases linearly with time, attaining blue edge velocities
near -3000 km/s, and absorption velocities near -1700 km/s, in 6 to 8 min after
starting near rest. We also find a subsequent linear deceleration to nearly
rest in 30 to 40 min, perhaps an effect of dilution as the wind expands. No
periodicity from rotational outflow is obvious.
  This wind is erratic and incessantly variable, and perhaps bipolar and
face-on, but not highly collimated. The P Cygni absorption events trace out
sawtooth waves, occurring within 30 to 40 white dwarf radii from the disk. This

system towards the BL Lac PKS 0118-272. At the absorber redshift we detect
lines of the low ionization species MgI, MgII, CaII, TiII, MnII, and FeII. The
column densities of these species are typical of the interstellar gas in the
disk of the Galaxy. By assuming dust-free gas with solar abundances we infer
N(HI) > 2.5 x 10^19 cm^-2. The high value of this conservative lower limit
indicates that the absorber is a Damped Ly alpha system. We find [Ti/Fe] =
+0.3, in agreement with [Ti/Fe] measurements in DLA absorbers, but [Mn/Fe] =
+0.4, at variance with the values [Mn/Fe]<0 common to DLA systems. The measured
[Ti/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios match remarkably well the differential depletion
pattern of low-density interstellar clouds in the Galaxy. Unlike high-redshift
DLA systems (z>2), the z=0.558 absorber seems to originate in a galaxy that has

observed abundances measured in the gas phase and the overall abundances (gas
plus dust) are derived as a function of dust-to-gas ratio, metallicity,
element-to-element abundance pattern, average extinction coefficient of dust
grains, and chemical composition of dust grains. A method is presented for
determining dust-to-gas ratios, dust-to-metals ratios, and dust-corrected
relative abundances in DLA absorbers by assuming dust of Galactic type and
constant abundance ratios between iron-peak elements. The method is applied to
a sample of 17 DLA absorbers with available Zn, Cr and/or Fe measurements. The
resulting dust-to-gas ratios are mostly distributed between 2% and 25% of the
Galactic value, in good quantitative agreement with the results from reddening
studies of QSOs with foreground DLA absorption. A correlation is found between
dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity in DLA galaxies, with a typical
dust-to-metals ratio of ~ 60% the Galactic value. The derived dust-to-metals
ratios are then used to correct from the effects of dust the abundance ratios
[Si/Fe], [S/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Ni/Fe] available for a sub-sample of 9
absorbers. The [alpha/Fe] ratios corrected from dust do not show the
enhancement characteristic of metal-poor Galactic stars, but instead have
essentially solar values, within +/- 0.2 dex. This suggests that the chemical
history of DLA absorbers is different from that experienced by the Milky Way.
Evidences that point to dwarf galaxies, rather than to spiral galaxies, as
important contributors to the DLA phenomenon are summarized.

correlators of the molecular centers of mass are determined and compared with

This is done in real as well as in momentum space. One of the main results is
the existence of a unique transition temperature T_c, where the dynamics
crosses over from an ergodic to a quasi-nonergodic behavior. The value for T_c
agrees with that found earlier for the orientational dynamics within the error
bars. In the beta- regime of MCT the factorization of space- and time
dependence is satisfactorily fulfilled for both types of correlations. The
first scaling law of ideal MCT holds in the von Schweidler regime, only, since
the validity of the critical law can not be confirmed, due to a strong
interference with the microscopic dynamics. In this first scaling regime a
consistent description within ideal MCT emerges only, if the next order
correction to the asymptotic law is taken into account. This correction is
almost negligible for q=q_max, the position of the main peak in the static
structure factor S(q), but becomes important for q=q_min, the position of its
first minimum. The second scaling law, i.e. the time-temperature superposition
principle, holds reasonably well for the self and collective density
correlators and different values for q. The alpha-relaxation times tau_q^(s)
and tau_q follow a power law in T-T_c over 2 -- 3 decades. The corresponding
exponent gamma is weakly q-dependent and is around 2.55. This value is in
agreement with the one predicted by MCT from the value of the von Schweidler
exponent but at variance with the corresponding exponent gamma

T_c, at which the dynamics changes significantly. The first scaling law of MCT,
which involves the critical correlator G(t), holds for l>=2, but no critical
law is observed. Since this is true for the same exponent parameter lambda as
obtained for the TDOF, we obtain a consistent description of both, the TDOF and
ODOF, with the exception of l=1. This different behavior for l \ne 1 and l=1
can also be seen from the corresponding susceptibilities
(chi'')_{ll}^m(q,omega) which exhibit a minimum at about the same frequency
omega_{min} for all q and all l \ne 1, in contrast to (chi'')_{11}^m(q,omega)
for which omega'_{min} approx 10 omega_{min} . The asymptotic regime, for which
the first scaling law holds, shrinks with increasing l. The second scaling law
of MCT (time-temperature superposition principle) is reasonably fulfilled for l

from the quantum theory and provides a mathematically well-defined realization

the global monopole. The physical properties and the range of validity of the
model are examined as is the motion of test particles in the dipole background.
It is found that the metric of the gravitational dipole describes a curved
space-time, so one would expect it to have a more pronounced effect on the
motion of the test particles than the spinning cosmic string. It is indeed so
and in the generic case the impact of repulsive centrifugal force results in a
motion whose orbits when projected on the equatorial plane represent unfolding
spirals or hyperbolas. Only in one special case these projections are straight
lines, pretty much in a manner observed in the field of the spinning cosmic
string. Even if open, the orbits are nevertheless bounded in the angular
coordinate $\theta$.

micron is aimed for the detector. Further demands are low occupancy and
radiation hardness up to 1 Mrad/year. Fibers with different radii and different
wavelengths of the scintillation light from different producers have been
extensively tested concerning light output, attenuation length and radiation
hardness, with and without coupling them to light guides of different length
and diameter.
  In a testrun at a 3 GeV electron beam the space dependent efficiency and
spatial resolution of fiber bundels were measured by means of two external
reference detectors with a precision of 50 micron. The light output profile
across fiber roads has been determined with the same accuracy.
  Different technologies were adopted for the construction of tracker modules
consisting of 14 layers of 0.5 mm fibers and 0.7 mm pitch. A winding technology
provides reliable results to produce later fiber modules of about 25 cm x 25 cm
area.
  We conclude that on the basis of these results a fiber tracker for high rate

higher value of magnetic field such as $B\sim 3\times 10^{15}$ Gauss in order

the neutrino momentum asymmetry. It is also shown that a general treatment with

interacting longitudinally polarized $W$ and $Z$ bosons are discussed within a
particular scheme of electroweak symmetry breaking. The scheme (suggested
earlier by other authors in a slightly different context) is based on
spontaneous breakdown of a SU(4) symmetry to custodial SU(2) subgroup. The
physical spectrum of such a model contains a set of relatively light
pseudo-Goldstone bosons whose interactions with vector bosons modify the
low-energy theorem proven for a ``minimal'' symmetry-breaking sector. The
Goldstone-boson manifold $SU(4)/SU(2)$ is not a symmetric space. In this
context it is observed that, on the other hand, there is a large class of
models of electroweak symmetry breaking, involving groups $G$ and $H$ such that
the $G/H$ is a symmetric space and the corresponding rich multiplets of

observe that a special variant of this model partially retains the linear
superposition principle for the wave packets of standard quantum mechanics

possesses the main properties of this equation such as the Galilean invariance,
the weak separability of composite systems, and the homogeneity in the wave
function. The modification is derived from the relativistic relation between
the energy and momentum of free particle and, as such, it is the best
relativistic extension of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation that preserves the
properties in question. The only change it effectively entails in the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation involves the conserved probability current. It is
pointed out that it partially retains the linear superposition principle and
that it can be used to model the process of decoherence.

Schr\""{o}dinger equation which preserves its main and unique feature: in the
natural system of units the modification terms do not contain any dimensional
constants. The extension, similarly as the original, is formulated in a
three-dimensional space and derives from a Galilean invariant Lagrangian. It is
pointed out that this model of nonlinearity violates the separability of
compound systems in the fundamentalist approach to this issue. In its general
form, this modification does not admit stationary states for all potentials for
which such states exist in linear quantum mechanics. This is, however, possible
for a suitable choice of its free parameters. It is only in the original
Staruszkiewicz modification that the energy of these states remains unchanged,
which marks the uniqueness of this variant of the modification.

"quant-ph/9710010","Waldemar Puszkarz","Waldemar Puszkarz","Nonlinear Phase Modification of the Schroedinger Equation","Latex, 21 pages, extended and slightly modified, new references added",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A nonlinear modification of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation is proposed in which
the Lagrangian density for the Schr\""{o}dinger equation is extended by terms
polynomial in $\Delta^{m}\ln (\Psi^{*}/{\Psi})$ multiplied by $\Psi^{*}{\Psi}$.
This introduces a homogeneous nonlinearity in a Galilean invariant manner
through the phase $S$ rather than the amplitude $R$ of the wave function $\Psi
=R\exp (iS)$. From this general scheme we choose the simplest minimal model
defined in some reasonable way. The model in question offers the simplest way
to modify the Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics so as to allow a leading
phase contribution to the quantum potential and a leading quantum contribution
to the probability current removing asymmetries present in Bohm's original
formulation. It preserves most of physically relevant properties of the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation including stationary states of quantum-mechanical
systems. It can be thought of as the simplest model of nonlinear quantum
mechanics of extended objects among other such models that also emerge within
the general scheme proposed. The extensions of this model to $n$ particles and
the question of separability of compound systems are studied. It is noted that
there exists a weakly separable extension in addition to a strongly separable
one. The place of the general modification scheme in a broader spectrum of
nonlinear modifications of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation is discussed. It is
pointed out that the models it gives rise to have a unique definition of energy
in that the field-theoretical energy functional coincides with the
quantum-mechanical one. It is found that the Lagrangian for its simplest
variant represents the Lagrangian for a restricted version of the
Doebner-Goldin modification of this equation.

It is shown that such extensions of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation do not exist,
