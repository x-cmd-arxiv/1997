rates sufficiently high (typically in excess of the local Eddington limit) to
stabilize the burning of accreted hydrogen and helium. For hydrogen-rich
accretion at global rates in excess of 10^-8 solar masses per year (typical of
a few neutron stars), we discuss the thermal state of the deep ocean and crust
and their coupling to the neutron star core, which is heated by conduction
(from the crust) and cooled by neutrino emission. We estimate the Ohmic
diffusion time in the hot, deep crust and find that it is noticeably shortened
(to less than 10^8 yr) from the values characteristic of the colder crusts in
slowly accreting neutron stars. We speculate on the implications of these
calculations for magnetic field evolution in the bright accreting X-ray
sources. We also explore the consequences of rapid compression at local
accretion rates exceeding ten times the Eddington rate. This rapid accretion
heats the atmosphere/ocean to temperatures of order 10^9 K at relatively low
densities; for stars accreting pure helium, this causes unstable ignition of
the ashes (mostly carbon) resulting from stable helium burning. This unstable
burning can re-occur on timescales as short as hours to days, and might be the
cause of some flares on helium accreting pulsars, in particular 4U~1626--67.
Such rapid local accretion rates are common on accreting X-ray pulsars, where
the magnetic field focuses the accretion flow onto a small fraction of the
stellar area.

are playing an increasingly important role in the study of stellar physics.
Because these elements are easily destroyed in stars at temperatures 2--4
million K, the abundances in the surface convective zone are diagnostics of the
star's internal workings. Standard stellar models cannot explain depletion
patterns observed in low mass stars, and so are not accounting for all the
relevant physical processes. These processes have important implications for
stellar evolution and primordial lithium production in big bang
nucleosynthesis. Because beryllium is destroyed at slightly higher temperatures
than lithium, observations of both light elements can differentiate between the
various proposed depletion mechanisms. Unfortunately, the reaction rate for the
main destruction channel, 9Be(p,alpha)6Li, is uncertain. A level in the
compound nucleus 10B is only 25.7 keV below the reaction's energetic threshold.
The angular momentum and parity of this level are not well known; current
estimates indicate that the resonance entrance channel is either s- or d-wave.
We show that an s-wave resonance can easily increase the reaction rate by an
order of magnitude at temperatures of approximately 4 million K. Observations
of sub-solar mass stars can constrain the strength of the resonance, as can
experimental measurements at lab energies lower than 30 keV.

that the nuclear gas disk seen in WFPC2 imaging by Bower et al. (1997, ApJ,
483, L33) is rotating rapidly. The velocity curve has an S-shape with a peak
amplitude of 400 km/s at 0.1"" = 8 pc from the nucleus. To model the observed
gas kinematics, we construct a thin Keplerian disk model that fits the data
well if the rotation axis of the gas disk is aligned with the radio jet axis.
These models indicate that the gas dynamics are driven by a nuclear compact
mass of 1.5 x 10^9 Msun with an uncertainty range of (0.9 - 2.6) x 10^9 Msun
and that the inclination of the disk with respect to the plane of the sky is 75
- 85 degrees. Of this nuclear mass, only <= 2 x 10^7 Msun can possibly be
attributed to luminous mass. Thus, we conclude that a dark compact mass (most
likely a supermassive black hole) resides in the nucleus of M84.

  (missing table 1 is now provided)",,"10.1086/300180",,"astro-ph",,"  Galactic chemical evolution model calculations indicate that there should be
considerable scatter in the observed N/O ratios at a fixed metallicity (O/H)
for galaxies with very low metallicities due to the delayed release of primary
N from intermediate mass stars relative to that of O from short-lived massive
stars. Moreover, the scatter should increase progressively toward decreasing
metallicity. Such effects have not been convincingly demonstrated by
observations of H II regions in nearby metal-poor galaxies, raising doubts
about the time-delay model of primary N production. Pettini et al and Lipman et
al realized the utility of high-redshift damped Lyman-alpha galaxies for
gaining further insights into the origin of N and discussed abundances in three
damped Lyman-alpha galaxies. Since abundance measurements for O are generally
unavailable for damped Lyman-alpha galaxies, they used N/Si or N/S in place of
N/O under the reasonable assumption that the abundance ratios O/Si and O/S are
the same as solar in damped Lyman-alpha galaxies. We discuss observations of
heavy element abundances in 15 high-redshift (z>2) damped Lyman-alpha galaxies,
many of which have metallicities comparable to or lower than the lowest
metallicity galaxy known locally (I Zw 18). We find that the N/Si ratios in
damped Lyman-alpha galaxies exhibit a very large scatter (about 1 dex) at
[Si/H]~-2 and there is some indication that the scatter increases toward
decreasing metallicity. Considerations of various sources of uncertainties
suggest that they are not likely the main causes of the large scatter. These
results thus provide strong support for the time-delay model of primary N
production in intermediate mass stars if, indeed, O/Si=solar in damped
Lyman-alpha galaxies.

bosonisation to show that the strong coupling regime at low energies can be
described by an SO(5)$_1$ WZW model (or equivalently 5 massless Majorana
fermions) deformed by symmetry breaking terms that nonetheless leave the theory
critical at T=0. The SO(5) currents of the theory comprise the charge and spin
currents and linear combinations of the so-called pi operators (S.C. Zhang,
Science 275, 1089 (1997)) which are local in terms both of the original
fermions and those of the effective theory. Using bosonisation we obtain the
asymptotic behaviour of all correlation functions. We find that the 5 component
``superspin'' vector has power law correlations at T=0; other fermion bilinears
have exponentially decaying correlations and the corresponding tendencies are
suppressed. Conformal field theory also allows us to obtain the energies,
quantum numbers, and degeneracies of the low-lying states and fit them into
deformed SO(5) multiplets.

the number of energy bands (smaller than $N$) times the universal constant

exterior metric is the vacuum solution obtained by the well known conformal
imaging method. The interior metric for every black hole is regular everywhere
and corresponds to a positive energy density. The resulting matched solutions
cover then the whole initial (Cauchy) hypersurface, without any singularity,
and can be useful for numerical applications. The simpler cases of one black
hole (Schwarzschild data) or two identical black holes (Misner data) are
explicitly solved. A procedure for extending this construction to the multiple
black hole case is also given, and it is shown to work for all time symmetric
vacuum solutions obtained by the conformal imaging method. The numerical
evolution of one such 'stuffed' black hole is compared with that of a pure
vacuum or 'plain' black hole in the spherically symmetric case.

operator dynamics to corresponding generating functionals, which is based on
the algebraic techniques. As a calculational benefit, this transition is
considerable short compared to standard ones. The transition is not injective
(unique) and depends additionally on the choice of an ordering. We obtain a
direct and constructive connection between orderings and the explicit form of
the functional Hamiltonian. These orderings depend on the propagator of the
theory and thus on the ground state. This is invisible in path integral
formulations. The method is demonstrated within two examples, a non-linear
spinor field theory and spinor QED. Antisymmetrized and normal-ordered
functional equations are derived in both cases.

problem the new scheme avoids the instabilities of the RPA and should be well
suited for large scale numerical calculations. These and additional properties
of the new approximation scheme are illuminated by a very simple exactly

A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.57.2169",,"quant-ph",,"  The phase of a single-mode field can be measured in a single-shot measurement
by interfering the field with an effectively classical local oscillator of
known phase. The standard technique is to have the local oscillator detuned
from the system (heterodyne detection) so that it is sometimes in phase and
sometimes in quadrature with the system over the course of the measurement.
This enables both quadratures of the system to be measured, from which the
phase can be estimated. One of us [H.M. Wiseman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4587
(1995)] has shown recently that it is possible to make a much better estimate
of the phase by using an adaptive technique in which a resonant local
oscillator has its phase adjusted by a feedback loop during the single-shot
measurement. In Ref.~[H.M. Wiseman and R.B. Killip, Phys. Rev. A 56, 944] we
presented a semiclassical analysis of a particular adaptive scheme, which
yielded asymptotic results for the phase variance of strong fields. In this
paper we present an exact quantum mechanical treatment. This is necessary for
calculating the phase variance for fields with small photon numbers, and also
for considering figures of merit other than the phase variance. Our results
show that an adaptive scheme is always superior to heterodyne detection as far
as the variance is concerned. However the tails of the probability distribution
are surprisingly high for this adaptive measurement, so that it does not always
result in a smaller probability of error in phase-based optical communication.
