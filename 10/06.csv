with many competing agents. Evolutionary events (speciations and extinctions)
are triggered by fitness records found by random exploration of the agents'
fitness landscapes. As a consequence, the average fitness in the system
increases logarithmically with time, while the rate of extinction steadily
decreases. This dynamics is studied by numerical simulations and, in a simpler
mean field version, analytically. We also study the effect of externally added
`mass' extinctions. The predictions for various quantities of paleontological
interest (life-time distributions, distribution of event sizes and behavior of
the rate of extinction) are robust and in good agreement with available data.

Nevertheless, we present in this paper the results of some detailed

the highest luminosities reached on the AGB. This is due to mass-loss reducing
the envelope mass so that HBB ceases but dredge-up continues. The high
mass-loss rate produces an optically thick wind before the star reaches C/O>1.
This is consistent with the recent results of van Loon et al. (1997a,b) who

different escape velocities at different galactocentric radii are presented. As
a consequence of this, the chemical evolution develops differently in different
galactic regions; in particular, we find that the galactic wind, powered by
supernovae (of type II and I) starts, under suitable conditions, in the outer
regions and successively develops in the central ones. The rate of star
formation (SFR) is assumed to stop after the onset of the galactic wind in each
region. The main result found in the present work is that this mechanism is
able to reproduce metallicity gradients, namely the gradients in the $Mg_2$
index, in good agreement with observational data. We also find that in order to
honor the constant [Mg/Fe] ratio with galactocentric distance, as inferred from
metallicity indices, a variable initial mass function as a function of
galactocentric distance is required. This is only a suggestion since trends on
abundances inferred just from metallicity indices are still uncertain.

this review we present a detailed theoretical investigation of the optical
properties of Skyrmions. Our results provide means for the optical detection of
Skyrmions using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. We first consider the
optical properties of Skyrmions in disordered systems. A calculation of the
luminescence energy reveals a special optical signature which allows us to
distinguish between Skyrmions and ordinary electrons. Two experiments to
measure the optical signature are proposed. We then turn to the optical
properties of Skyrmions in pure systems. We show that, just like an ordinary
electron, a Skyrmion may bind with a hole to form a Skyrmionic exciton. The
Skyrmionic exciton can have a lower energy than the ordinary magnetoexciton.
The optical signature of Skyrmions is found to be a robust feature of the PL
spectrum in both disordered and pure systems.

strongly on the temperature and on the ratio between the cyclotron radius $R_c$

$a_{\delta\rho}$ can be equal to the modulation period $a$, but also much
smaller. For $R_c \sim a_{\delta\rho}$ the spectrum in the vicinity of the

Hartree potential: For noninteger filling factors the energy dispersion is
reduced, like in the case of an electrostatic modulation, whereas for
even-integer filling factors, on the contrary, the dispersion may be amplified.

shape broadens as the jet pseudorapidity ($\eta^{jet}$) increases and narrows
as $E^{jet}_T$ increases. In dijet photoproduction, the jet shapes have been
measured separately for samples dominated by resolved and by direct processes.
Leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo calculations of resolved and direct
processes describe well the measured jet shapes except for the inclusive
production of jets with high $\eta^{jet}$ and low $E^{jet}_T$. The observed
broadening of the jet shape as $\eta^{jet}$ increases is consistent with the
predicted increase in the fraction of final state gluon jets.

which is however equivalent to the term vacuum in axiomatic quantum field
theory and the GNS construction in C^*-algebras. This approach is shown to be
equivalent to the usual picture which fixes one product but employs a variety
of GNS states. The most striking novelty of the geometric approach is the fact
that dynamical data fix uniquely the vacuum and that positivity is not
required. The usual concept of a statistical quantum state can be generalized
to geometric meaningful but non-statistical, non-definite, situations.
Furthermore, an algebraization of states takes place. An application to physics
is provided by an U(2)-symmetry producing a gap-equation which governs a phase
transition. The parameterization of all vacua is explicitly calculated from
propagator matrix elements. A discussion of the relation to BCS theory and

sections of a vector bundle over a compact Riemannian manifold with generalized
local boundary conditions including both normal and tangential derivatives is
studied. The condition of strong ellipticity of this boundary-value problem is
formulated. The resolvent kernel and the heat kernel in the leading
approximation are explicitly constructed. As a result, the previous work in the
literature on heat-kernel asymptotics is shown to be a particular case of a
more general structure. For a bosonic gauge theory on a compact Riemannian
manifold with smooth boundary, the problem is studied of obtaining a
gauge-field operator of Laplace type, jointly with local and gauge-invariant
boundary conditions, which should lead to a strongly elliptic boundary-value
problem. The scheme is extended to fermionic gauge theories by means of local
and gauge-invariant projectors. After deriving a general condition for the
validity of strong ellipticity for gauge theories, it is proved that for
Euclidean Yang--Mills theory and Rarita--Schwinger fields all the above
conditions can be satisfied. For Euclidean quantum gravity, however, this
property no longer holds, i.e. the corresponding boundary-value problem is not
strongly elliptic. Some non-standard local formulae for the leading asymptotics
of the heat-kernel diagonal are also obtained. It is shown that, due to the
absence of strong ellipticity, the heat-kernel diagonal is non-integrable near

approximation to the description of properties of light nuclei with large
neutron excess. Pairing correlations and the coupling to particle continuum
states are described by finite range two-body forces. Using standard parameter
sets for the mean-field Lagrangian and the pairing interaction of Gogny-type,
self-consistent solutions in coordinate space are calculated for the ground
states of a number of neutron-rich nuclei. The model predicts the location of
the neutron drip-line, reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, $rms$ radii,
changes in surface properties, the formation of neutron skin and of neutron
halo.

explored in detail. In the low-density limit we recover the leading term of the
virial expansion for the thermodynamic potential. An instructive diagrammatic
interpretation of the contributions to the total baryon number is presented.
Furthermore, we examine within a fireball model the consequences for the pion
spectra in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies, including the effect
of collective flow. A consistent treatment of the Delta width leads to a
substantial enhancement of the pion yield at low momenta.

  Molinari and R. A. Ricci directors, Varenna, Italy, 22 July - 1 August 1997",,,,"nucl-th hep-th",,"  We develop a statistical theory of the mean field. It is based on the
proposition that the mean field can be obtained as an energy average. Moreover,
it is assumed that the matrix elements of the residual interaction are random
with the average value of zero. Explicit expressions for the mean field and the
fluctuation away from the average are obtained. The fluctuation is expanded in
terms of more and more complex excitations. Using the randomness of the matrix
elements one can then obtain formulas for the contribution to the error from
each class of complex excitations and a general condition for the convergence
of the expansion is derived. Making some simplifying assumptions a schematic
model is developed and applied to the problem of nuclear matter. It yields a
measure of the strength of the effective interaction. The latter turns out to
be three orders of magnitude less than that calculated using a potential which
gives a binding energy of about -7 MeV/nucleon demonstrating the strong damping
of the interaction strength induced by the averaging process.

momentums of these solutions, we saparate the photon-like solutions through the
requirement their integral intrinsic angular momentums to be equal to the
Planck's constant. Finally, we consider such solutions, moving radially to or
from a given center, using standard spherical coordinates.

algebra A, and its subgroups from the point of view of their action on the
space of involutions in A. This action formally resembles Moebius
transformations known from complex geometry. By specifying A to be an algebra
of bounded operators in a Hilbert space H, we rediscover the Moebius group
defined by Connes and study its action on the space of Fredholm modules over
the algebra A. There is an induced action on the K-homology of A, which turns
out to be trivial. Moreover, this action leads naturally to a simpler object,
the polarized module underlying a given Fredholm module, and we discuss this
relation in detail. Any polarized module can be lifted to a Fredholm module,
and the set of different lifts forms a category, whose morphisms are given by
generalized Moebius tranformations. We present an example of a polarized module
canonically associated with the differentiable structure of a smooth manifold
V. Using our lifting procedure we obtain a class of Fredholm modules
characterizing the conformal structures on V. Fredholm modules obtained in this
way are a special case of those constructed by Connes, Sullivan and Teleman.

in uncertainty relations.It is argued that in many contexts it is necessary to
extend the Hilbert space in order to define a conjugate operator as in gauge
theories. Example of a particle in a box is analysed. This is closely related
to the quantum oscillator through cosine states of Susskind and Glogower.It is
used to justify London's phase wave functions albeit as part of a larger
Hilbert space. A new definition phase uncertainty neccessiated by periodicity
is proposed.It is close to the usual r.m.s. definition.Corresponding number-
phase uncertainty relation is obtained and its implications are discussed.
Hilbert space of an oscillator is identified with the Hilbert space of a planar
rotor with a $Z_2$ gauge invariance.This is used to construct states analogous
to the cosine and sine states and to illustrate unitary equivalence of Hilbert
spaces.
