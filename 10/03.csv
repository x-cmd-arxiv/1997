energy (UHE) neutrinos at thousands EeV, born by photoproduction of pions by
UHE protons on relic 2.73 K BBR radiation and originated in AGNs at cosmic
distances. However these UHE $\nu$s may interact with those (mainly heaviest
$\nu_{\mu_r}$, $\nu_{\tau_r}$ and respective antineutrinos) clustered into HDM
galactic halos. UHE photons or protons, secondaries of $\nu\nu_r$ scattering,
might be the final observed signature of such high-energy chain reactions and
may be responsible of the highest extragalactic cosmic-ray (CR) events. The
chain-reactions conversion efficiency, ramifications and energetics are
considered for the October 1991 CR event at 320 EeV observed by the Fly's Eye
detector in Utah. These quantities seem compatible with the distance, direction
and power (observed at MeV gamma energies) of the Seyfert galaxy MCG 8-11-11.
The $\nu\nu_r$ interaction probability is favoured by at least three order of
magnitude with respect to a direct $\nu$ scattering onto the Earth atmosphere.
Therefore, it may better explain the extragalactic origin of the puzzling 320
EeV event, while offering indirect evidence of a hot dark galactic halo of
light (i.e., $m_\nu\sim$ tens eV) neutrinos, probably of tau flavour.

  publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics","Astron.Astrophys.330:910,1998",,,"astro-ph",,"  A new optical reddening model for the Solar neighborhood is presented. The
model makes use of the large-scale properties of the dust layer in the Galaxy,
and of the observed clumpiness in its distribution, and it is used to compute
starcounts in the plane of the Galaxy, which are compared to the observed
counts from the Guide Star Catalogue (GSC) for a few representative regions
having a range of reddening values. These comparisons provide a good test case
in a wide variety of conditions with regards to both the amount and
distribution of the reddening material along the line-of-sight.
  This is the first systematic study of low-Galactic latitude starcounts from
the perspective of a Galactic structure and reddening model, and it is
demonstrated that the model can be used to obtain meaningful starcount
estimates in the plane of the Milky-Way.
  Our best-fit model to three (out of six) selected regions yields a distance
of the Sun from the symmetry plane of the Galaxy of Z_Sun=27 +/- 3 (3 sigma)
pc, while the disk's scale-length is found to be H_Disk= 6 +/- 2 (3 sigma) kpc.
While the derived value for Z_Sun is quite sensitive to the adopted
scale-height of disk stars, no big dependency of H_Disk on this parameter is
found.
  The accuracy of the reddening and starcounts model opens the possibility of
using it to estimate and compare observations of diffuse starlight to constrain
the major structural parameters of the Galaxy, and to compute the distance
distribution of stars self-consistently with the starcounts, in order to derive
corrections to absolute parallax.

of the radio flares followed by a more gradual decrease of the emission. We
detect a systematic change of the radio spectral index alpha which typically
becomes larger than zero at the onset of the radio outbursts. This behavior is
suggestive of expansion of material initially optically thick to radio
frequencies, indicating either that synchrotron or inverse Compton cooling are
important or that the free-free optical depth to the source is rapidly
changing. After two years of observations, we see only weak evidence for the
proposed 4-year periodic modulation in the peak flux of the outbursts. We
observe a secular trend in the outburst phases according the the best published
ephemeris. This trend indicates either orbital period evolution, or a drift in
outburst orbital phase in response to some other change in the system.

the problem of rotational mixing in halo stars. The distribution of initial
conditions inferred from young clusters produces a well-defined halo lithium
""plateau"" with modest scatter and a small population of outliers. Different
choices for the solar calibration produce a range of absolute depletion
factors. We show that both the dispersion and the ratio of $^6$Li depletion to
$^7$Li depletion increase as the absolute $^7$Li depletion increases. The
measured $^6$Li in HD 84937 and the dispersion in the plateau set independent
upper bounds on the $^7$Li depletion. Consistency with open clusters and the

at a high rate. There is somewhat meager observational evidence indicating that
bars in real galaxies do rotate rapidly and we use our result to argue that
dark matter halos must have a low central density in all high surface
brightness disk galaxies, including the Milky Way. Bars in galaxies that have
larger fractions of dark matter should rotate slowly, and we suggest that a
promising place to look for such candidate objects is among galaxies of
intermediate surface brightness.

analysed the density-of-states (DOS) and the conductance of a S/N junction with
a barrier. They showed that the DOS in the N conductor near the barrier is
strongly affected by the superconductor if the energy $\epsilon$ is small:
$l_{n} \sqrt{\epsilon/D}{\ll} \Gamma {\ll} 1$, where $l_{n}$ is the mean free
path, $D$ is the diffusion constant, and $\Gamma$ is the barrier transmittance.
We would like to note that this problem was analysed in several papers with the
use of different approaches. In particular, the author has calculated the DOS
and the conductance of S/N structures with a barrier using quasiclassical
matrix Green's function technique well developed in the theory of
superconductivity \cite{r2}. It was shown that in an 1-d S/N structure a
pseudogap appears in the N conductor near the S/N interface, and the DOS
approaches it's normal value at energies $\epsilon$ exceeding an energy
$\epsilon_{N}$ related to the interface transmittance; here $\epsilon_{N}=D/(2
R_{b} \sigma)^{2}$, $R_{b}$ is the interface resistance per unit area, and
$\sigma$ is the specific conductivity of the N conductor. It was shown that
peculiarities in the DOS at small energies lead to a subgap conductance at zero
temperature. This subgap conductance is caused by a component of the current
which is known in the theory of the Josephson effect as the interference
current.Therefore, the results for the DOS and the conductance in Ref \cite{r1}
are similar to the ones obtained earlier, but their interpretation of the
subgap conductance differs from that given in Ref.\cite{r2} because they use
another approach for the calculation of the conductance .

a large class of models with long-range interactions, both in one and higher

lithography and a liftoff process involving a four layer resist system. Wires
having micrometres in length and below 200 nm in width were deposited on an
insulating substrate and subsequently thinned by anodisation. The resistance of
the wires was monitored in situ and could be trimmed by controlling the
anodisation voltage and time. The method appears appropriate for the
fabrication of very small resistors for use as biasing resistors for single
electron devices. Transport properties of these resistors were measured at
millikelvin temperatures. They had nonlinear current-voltage characteristics
around zero bias and showed a transistion from superconducting to insulating
behaviour. Analysis of the offset voltage showed that a Coulomb blockade set in
when the sheet resistance of the films exceeded the superconducting quantum
resistance approx 6.45 kOhm. Samples in a single electron transistor-like
geometry with two variable thickness weak links were made by combined angular
evaporation of niobium and anodisation. Overlapping gate electrodes were
deposited on these samples. The drain-source current-voltage characteristics
could be modulated by the gate voltage, giving a response typical for a system

corotating binary stars in equilibrium states assuming the stiff polytropic
equation of state with the adiabatic constant $\Gamma=3$. In previous 1PN
numerical studies on corotating binary stars in equilibrium states, it was
found that along the sequence of binary stars as a function of the orbital
separation, they have the energy and/or angular momentum minima where the
secular instability sets in, and that with increase of the 1PN correction, the
orbital separation at these minima decreases while the angular velocity there
increases. In this paper, to know the location of the innermost stable circular
orbit(ISCO), we perform numerical simulations and find where the hydrodynamical
instability along the corotating sequences of binary sets in. From the
numerical results, we found that the dynamical stability limit seems to exist
near the energy and/or angular momentum minima not only in the Newtonian, but
also in the 1PN cases. This means that the 1PN effect of general relativity
increases the angular frequency of gravitational waves at the ISCO.

as a test for linear dependence with constant coefficients between the three
components of the metric in the orbits in canonical coordinates. In general, it
is shown that such a relation implies that the metric is locally diagonalizable
in canonical coordinates, or has a null Killing vector, or can locally be
written in a generalized form of the `windmill' solutions characterized by
McIntosh. If the orbits of the $G_2I$ have cylindrical or toroidal topology and
a periodic coordinate is used, these metric forms cannot in general be realized
globally as they would conflict with the topological identification. The
geometry then has additional essential parameters, which specify the
topological identification. The physical significance of these parameters is
shown by their appearance in global holonomy and by examples of exterior
solutions where they have been related to characteristics of physical sources.
These results lead to some remarks about the definition of cylindrical

three-body decays of right-handed selectrons and smuons into final states
involving a tau, a stau, and an electron or muon, which are relevant in this
scenario. We find that the three-body decays dominate over much of the
parameter space, but the two-body decays into a lepton and a gravitino can
compete if the three-body phase space is small and the supersymmetry-breaking
scale (governing the two-body channel) is fairly low. We study this situation
quantitatively for typical gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model
parameters. The three-body decay lengths are possibly macroscopic, leading to
new unusual signals. We also analyze the final-state energy distributions, and
briefly assess the prospects for detecting these decays at CERN LEP2 and other
colliders.

found to be the same as that of the pure $CP^1$ model. This symplectic
structure is shown to be inherited from the global SU(2) invariant $S^3$ model,
and undergoes no modification upon gauging the U(1) subgroup, except the
appearance of an additional first class constraint generating U(1) gauge
transformation. We then address the question of fractional spin as imparted by
the Hopf term at the classical level. For that we construct the expression of
angular momentum through both symmetric energy-momentum tensor as well as
through Noether's prescription. Both the expressions agree for the model
indicating no fractional spin is imparted by this term at the classical level-a
result which is at variance with what has been claimed in the literature. We
provide an argument to explain the discrepancy and corroborate our argument by
considering a radiation gauge fixed Hopf term coupled to $CP^1$ model, where
the desired fractional spin is reproduced and is given in terms of the soliton
number. Finally, by making the gauge field of the $CP^1$ model dynamical by
adding the Chern-Simons term, the model ceases to be a $CP^1$ model, as is the
case with its nonrelativistic counterpart. This model is also shown to reveals
the existence of `anomalous' spin. This is however given in terms of the total
charge of the system, rather than any soliton number.

relation proposed by Yoneya through breakdown of topological symmetry in the
large $N$ matrix model. Next, on the basis of only two basic principles, those
are, generalized space-time uncertainty principle containing spinor field and
topological symmetry, we construct a new matrix model. If we furthermore impose
a requirement of N=2 supersymmetry, this new matrix model exactly reduces to
the IKKT model or the Yoneya model for IIB superstring depending on an
appropriate choice for a scalar function. A key feature of these formulations
is an appearance of the nontrivial ""dynamical"" theory through breakdown of
topological symmetry in the matrix model. It is closely examined why the
nontrivial ""dynamical"" theory appears from the trivial topological field
theory.

created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, and encountered in compact objects
in astrophysics, constitute one of the most active frontiers in nuclear
physics. In these Lectures, we discuss various approaches to the description of
hot and/or dense matter, including the simple Skyrme-type parameterization and
relativistic Walecka-type models, as well as microscopic Dirac-Brueckner and
QCD sum rule approaches. As density and/or temperature of the hadronic system
increases, chiral symmetry is gradually restored, as indicated by the decrease
of quark condensate. This has profound effects on the properties of hadrons,
especially their masses. We review various theoretical predictions for hadron
properties in dense matter. Experimentally, possible medium modifications of
hadron properties can be studied through the measurements of particle spectra,
flow, and particularly, electromagnetic observables. Particle production,
especially the production of rare particles such as kaons, vector mesons, and
antiparticles, provides useful insight into heavy-ion collision dynamics, and
hadron properties in dense matter. Collective flows of various kinds are
important observables in heavy-ion collisions. They probe essentially the
entire reaction process, and thus are very useful for the determination of the
reaction dynamics. They also reflect the properties of hadrons in dense matter.
Electromagnetic signals are considered penetrating probes that may carry
undistorted information about the early stage of high-energy heavy-ion
collisions. We discuss various theoretical calculations of dilepton and photon
production in heavy-ion collisions at SPS energies and various medium effects
that have been proposed to explain the observed low-mass dilepton enhancement.

central Coulomb potential does not introduce correlations between pions, it
does prevent an accurate measurement of the momentum difference. This momentum
difference smearing effect leads to a reduction in the measured correlation
radii and lambda parameters. These distortions are important in 158 GeV/nucleon
Pb+Pb collisions because of large source sizes and the strong central Coulomb
potential.

theory of Kashiwara, we relate this problem to the calculation of tensor
product multiplicities of highest weight irreducible representations of the
affine Lie algebra $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$. These multiplicities have a combinatorial
description in terms of higher level paths or highest-lift multipartitions.
This enables us to solve the Jantzen-Seitz problem for Ariki-Koike algebras,
that is, to determine which irreducible representations of $\H_m(\v)$ restrict
to irreducible representations of $\H_{m-1}(\v)$. From a combinatorial point of
view, this problem is identical to that of computing the tensor product of an
$A_{n-1}^{(1)}$-module of level $l$ and one of level 1. We also consider
natural generalisations of the Jantzen-Seitz problem corresponding to the
product of a level $l$ module by a level $l'>1$ module, and from the
commutativity of tensor products, we deduce a remarkable symmetry between the
generalised Jantzen-Seitz conditions and the sets of parameters of the
Ariki-Koike algebras.
