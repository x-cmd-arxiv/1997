  systems and algebraic geometry. Available in gzipped postscript form at
  http://math.cornell.edu/~mgross/paper17.ps.gz",,,,"alg-geom hep-th math.AG",,"  In 1996, Strominger, Yau and Zaslow made a conjecture about the geometric
relationship between two mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds. Roughly put, if X and Y
are a mirror pair of such manifolds, then X should possess a special Lagrangian
torus fibration $f:X\to B$ such that Y is obtained by dualizing the fibration
f. This leaves a huge amount to be done to verify such conjectures. This paper
takes a speculative point of view, in that it assumes that a special Lagrangian
torus fibration exists on X. We address a number of questions of a topological
nature: what is the relationship between the cohomology of X and the cohomology
of the dual fibration? what kind of information does the Leray spectral
sequence for f contain? what is the relationship between the topological (1,1)
couplings of the dual of f and the (1,n-1)-couplings of X in the large complex
structure limit? These questions are shown to have nice answers if a key
conjecture about the monodromy diffeomorphisms about a large complex structure
limit point holds. Roughly put, this conjecture says that monodromy about a
large complex structure limit point can be described as a very natural
generalization of a Dehn twist for an elliptic curve. Given this conjecture, we
show, among other results, that the large complex radius limit of the (1,n-1)
couplings on X coincide with the topological (1,1) couplings on Y, and if dim
X=3, the Leray filtration and weight filtrations of the mixed Hodge structure
coincide, as conjectured by myself and P.M.H. Wilson, and independently by D.
Morrison.

considerable promise as the mechanism responsible for producing warped,

global mode of the disk, thereby avoiding the difficulties with earlier models
for the precession. Here we follow up earlier work to study the linear behavior
of the instability in the specific context of a binary system. We treat the
influence of the companion as an orbit-averaged, quadrupole torque on the disk.
The presence of this external torque allows the existence of solutions in which
the direction of precession of the warp is retrograde with respect to disk
rotation, in addition to the prograde solutions which exist in the absence of
external torques.

more then 60% have 50 keV < H < 300 keV. Is the narrow range of H a real
feature of GRBs or is it due to an observational difficulty to detect harder
bursts? We consider a population of standard candle bursts with a hardness
distribution: rho(H) d log H \propto H^gamma d log H and no luminosity -
hardness correlation. We model the detection algorithm of BATSE as a function
of H, including cosmological effects, detector characteristics and triggering
procedure, and we calculate the expected distribution of H in the observed
sample for various values of gamma. Both samples shows a paucity of soft
(X-ray) bursts, which may be real. However, we find that the observed samples
are consistent with a distribution above H=120 keV with gamma \sim -0.5 (a
slowly decreasing numbers of GRBs per decade of hardness). Thus, we suggest
that a large population of unobserved hard gamma-ray bursts may exist.

imaginary-time Green's function within the Maximum Entropy method in order to
obtain the spectral function at real frequencies. For some values of the
momentum sufficiently away from the Fermi surface two separate peaks are found,
which can be identified as charge and spin excitations.
  In order to improve our accuracy and to be able to extend our study to a
larger portion of the Brillouin zone, we also fit our data with the
imaginary-time Green's function obtained from the Luttinger-model solution with
two different velocities as fitting parameters. The excitation energies
associated with these velocities turn out to agree, in a broad range of
momenta, with the ones calculated from the charge and spin susceptibilities.
This allows us to identify these single-particle excitations as due to a
separation of spin and charge. Remarkably, the range of momenta where
spin-charge separation is seen extends well beyond the region of linear
dispersion about the Fermi surface. We finally discuss a possible extension of
our method to detect spin-charge separation numerically in two dimensions.

non-linear interaction between two mass monopole moments and, dominantly, the

show that the data require a Pomeron-proton cross section that first decreases

similar to real particle total cross sections. We measure the product, (K x

required for the analytic isolation of infrared singularities of n+2 parton
scattering processes contributing to the next-to-next-to-leading order
corrections to n jet cross sections. In each case the colour ordered matrix
elements factorise and yield a function containing the singular factors
multiplying the n parton amplitudes. When the unresolved particles are not
colour connected, the approximations are simple products of the familar eikonal
and Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions used to describe single unresolved
emission. However, when the unresolved particles are colour connected the
factorisation is more complicated and we introduce new and general functions to
describe the triple collinear and soft/collinear limits in addition to the
known double soft gluon limits of Berends and Giele. As expected the triple
collinear splitting functions obey an N=1 SUSY identity. To illustrate the use
of these double unresolved approximations, we have examined the singular limits
of the tree level matrix elements for e+e- to 5 partons when only three partons
are resolved. When integrated over the unresolved regions of phase space, these
expressions will be of use in evaluating the O(alpha_s^3) corrections to the

quark-parton model of cumulative phenomena based on perturbative QCD
calculations of the corresponding quark diagrams near the thresholds, at which

that in the case of the production of cumulative protons from deuteron the

hadronization through one cumulative quark fragmentation into proton the same

formal high-frequency expansions of spectral densities. It is also well known
that the latter expansions are generally not literally true beyond the first
term. However, the terms in the heat-kernel expansion correspond rigorously to
quantities called Riesz means of the spectral expansion, which damp out
oscillations in the spectral density at high frequencies by dint of performing
an average over the density at all lower frequencies. In general, a change of
variables leads to new Riesz means that contain different information from the
old ones. In particular, for the standard second-order elliptic operators,
Riesz means with respect to the square root of the spectral parameter
correspond to terms in the asymptotics of elliptic and hyperbolic Green
functions associated with the operator, and these quantities contain ""nonlocal""
information not contained in the usual Riesz means and their correlates in the
heat kernel. Here the relationship between these two sets of Riesz means is
worked out in detail; this involves just classical one-dimensional analysis and
calculation, with no substantive input from spectral theory or quantum field
theory. This work provides a general framework for calculations that are often

"physics/9710007","Dieter Flamm","D. Flamm","Ludwig Boltzmann -- A Pioneer of Modern Physics","5 pages, Latex",,,"UWThPh-1997-32","physics.hist-ph",,"  In two respects Ludwig Boltzmann was a pioneer of quantum mechanics. First
because in his statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics
he introduced the theory of probability into a fundamental law of physics and
thus broke with the classical prejudice, that fundamental laws have to be
strictly deterministic. Even Max Planck had not been ready to accept
Boltzmann's statistical methods until 1900. With Boltzmann's pioneering work
the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics had already a precedent.
In fact in a paper in 1897 Boltzmann had already suggested to Planck to use his
statistical methods for the treatment of black body radiation. The second
pioneering step towards quantum mechanics was Boltzmann's introduction of
discrete energy levels. Boltzmann used this method already in his 1872 paper on
the H-theorem. One may ask whether Boltzmann considered this procedure only as
a mathematical device or whether he attributed physical significance to it. In
this connection Ostwald reports that when he and Planck tried to convince
Boltzmann of the superiority of purely thermodynamic methods over atomism at
the Halle Conference in 1891 Boltzmann suddenly said: ``I see no reason why
energy shouldn't also be regarded as divided atomically.'' Finally I would like
to mention, that Boltzmann in his lectures on Natural Philosophy in 1903
already anticipated the equal treatment of space coordinates and time
introduced in the theory of special relativity. Furthermore in the lectures by
Boltzmann and his successor Fritz Hasen\""ohrl in Vienna the students learned
already about noneuclidean geometry, so that they could immediately start to
work when Einstein's general theory of relativity had been formulated.
