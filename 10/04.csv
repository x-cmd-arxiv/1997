1379, an E0 galaxy in the Fornax Cluster. Our data are from both Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) and ground-based observations. The HST photometry (B only) is
essentially complete and free of foreground/background contamination to ~2 mag
fainter than the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function. Fitting a
Gaussian to the luminosity function we find <B> =24.95+-0.30 and \sigma_B =
1.55+-0.21. We estimate the total number of globular clusters to be 436+- 30.
To a radius of 70 arcsec we derive a moderate specific frequency, S_N=3.5 +-
0.4. At radii r~ 3-6 kpc the surface density profile of the globular cluster
system is indistinguishable from that of the underlying galaxy light. At r
\ltsim 2.5 kpc the profile of the globular cluster system flattens, and at r
\ltsim 1 kpc, the number density appears to decrease. The (B-I) colour
distribution of the globular clusters (from ground-based data) is similar to
that for Milky Way globulars, once corrected for background contamination. It
shows no evidence for bimodality or for the presence of a population with
[Fe/H]\gtsim -0.5. Unlike in the case of larger, centrally located cluster
ellipticals, neither mergers nor a multiphase collapse are required to explain
the formation of the NGC 1379 globular cluster system. We stress the importance
of correcting for background contamination: the colour distribution of
background galaxies is strongly peaked slightly bluer than the peak of a
typical globular cluster distribution. This can create the impression of skewed
colour distributions, or bimodality where none exists.

order accuracy. We introduce a new leapfrog integrator that allows for variable
timesteps for each particle in large N-body simulations. Tests with single
particles in fixed potentials show that it behaves as a symplectic integrator.
  We then examine the results of both standard leapfrog and our temporally
adaptive leapfrog on full N-body integrations of clusters and large scale
structure establishing accuracy criteria for both methods. The adaptive method
shows significant speed-ups over single step integrations---but the integrator
no longer appears to be symplectic or, in the case of large scale structure
simulations, accurate. This loss of accuracy appears to be caused by the way
that the timestep is chosen, not by the integrator itself. We present a related
integration technique that does retain sufficient accuracy. Although it is not
symplectic, it is apparently better than previous implementations and is our
current integrator of choice for large astrophysical simulations. We also note
that the standard leapfrog difference equations used in cosmological N-body
integrations in comoving coordinates are not symplectic. We derive an
implementation of leapfrog that is in comoving canonical coordinates to correct

study the spectral curves for various distributions of the random site

probability distributions of the site energies, we find that as the randomness
increases the energy at which the localization-delocalization transition occurs
increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases. The Cauchy distribution
studied previously in the literature does not have this generic behavior. We
determine the critical value of the randomness at which ""wings"" first appear in

tails, we show that this critical value is infinitesimally above zero. We
determine the density of eigenvalues on the wings for any probability
distribution. We show that the localization length on the wings diverges
linearly as the energy approaches the energy at which the
localization-delocalization transition occurs. These results are all obtained

quantum-mechanical interference term by a factor (1-\zeta) and use the
``decoherence parameter'' \zeta as a measure for deviations from quantum
mechanics. We investigate several consequences of this modification of
semileptonic B^0 \bar B^0 decays. In particular, we show that when confronted
with the experimental values of the ratio R=(# like-sign dilepton events)/(#
opposite-sign dilepton events) and of the B_H--B_L mass difference, the ensuing
one standard deviation range of the decoherence parameter depends strongly on
the basis in the B^0--\bar B^0 space used to build the entangled B^0 \bar B^0
state. On the other hand, in quantum mechanics physical quantities are, of
course, independent of such arbitrary basis choices.

  Physics-97 July 1997, Dubna, Russia","Phys.Atom.Nucl.61:1098-1106,1998",,,"hep-ph astro-ph",,"  The effect of non-universal SUSY soft breaking on predictions of dark matter
detector event rates are surveyed for supergravity models with gravity mediated
soft breaking. For universal soft breaking in the first two generations and
tan(beta)<=20, non-universal effects can be characterized by four parameters
(two for Higgs and two for third generation squarks) in addition to those of
the minimal model (MSGM). These can increase or decrease event rates by a
factor of 10-100 in the domain m_{\chi_1^0}<60 GeV (\chi_1^0= lightest
neutralino) but produce generally small effects at higher masses. The value of
the top mass and b->s+\gamma branching ratio eliminates most of the parameter
space for \mu<0, causing event rates for \mu<0 to be a factor approximately 100
smaller than for mu>0. A correlation between large (small) event rates and
small (large) b-> s+\gamma branching ratio is observed. The effect of future
satellite (MAP and PLANCK) precision determinations of cosmological parameters
on predicted event rates is examined for examples of the \Lambda CDM and \nu
CDM models. It is seen that these could sharpen the event rate predictions and
also restrict the allowed gaugino mass ranges, thus influencing predictions for
accelerator SUSY searches.

motion equations is chosen as a Lagrangian of the pure classical dual nonlinear

electromagnetic strengths at the point of the time-space appears in the model.
Motion equations may well be interpreted as the equations of the standard
Maxwell theory with source. Alternative interpretation is the quasi-Maxwell
linear theory with magnetic charge. Analogous approach is possible in the
Yang-Mills theory. In this case the dual-invariant non-Abelian theory motion
equations possess the same instanton solutions as the conventional Yang--Mills
equations have. An Abelian two-parameter dual group is found to exist in
Gravitation. Irreducible representations have been obtained: the curvature
tensor was expanded into the sum of twice anti-self-dual and self-dual parts.
Gravitational instantons are defined as (real) solutions to the usual duality
equations. Central-symmetry solutions to these equations are obtained. The
twice anti-self-dual part of the curvature tensor may be used for introduction
of new gravitational equations generalizing Einstein's equations. However, the
theory obtained reduces to the conformal-flat Nordstrom theory.

perturbations, externally applied or from internal instabilities, may cause
pulse propagation failure (wave breakup) provided the system is close enough to
the bifurcation point. We derive relations showing how the pitchfork
bifurcation is unfolded by weak curvature or advective field perturbations and
use them to demonstrate wave breakup. We suggest that the recent observations
of wave breakup in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction induced either by an
electric field or a transverse instability are manifestations of this
mechanism.
