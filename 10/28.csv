100h^-1 Mpc scales. The observed location restricts models to two extreme areas

(Omega_b/Omega_0 > 0.3) to yield significant features. The first region
requires Omega_0 < 0.2h to match the location, implying large blue tilts
(n>1.4) to satisfy cluster abundance constraints. The power spectrum also
continues to rise toward larger scales in these models. The second region
requires Omega_0 near 1, implying Omega_b well out of the range of big bang
nucleosynthesis constraints; moreover, the peak is noticeably wider than the
observations suggest. Testable features of both solutions are that they require
moderate reionization and thereby generate potentially observable (about 1 uK)
large-angle polarization, as well as sub-arc-minute temperature fluctuations.
In short, baryonic features in adiabatic models may explain the observed excess
only if currently favored determinations of cosmological parameters are in
substantial error or if present surveys do not represent a fair sample of

steepens between 0.3 and 0.2 solar masses, but theoretical models show no such

observational mass-radius relationship relies upon transformations that may not
be sufficiently accurate, while the theoretical relationship relies upon
stellar models that may not be sufficiently complete, particularly in their
treatment of the complex physics governing the interior equation-of-state.
  If the features in the observationally derived mass-radius relationship are
real, their existence provides a natural explanation for the well-known gap in
the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variables. This explanation
relies only upon the observed mass-radius relationship of low-mass stars, and
does not require ad hoc changes in magnetic braking or in the structure of
cataclysmic variable secondaries. If correct, it will allow broader application
of cataclysmic variable observations to problems of basic stellar physics.

the dominant contribution to the total radiation field comes from the disk,

amplitude velocity and density changes. Both infall and outflow can occur in
different regions of the wind at the same time. On the other hand, if the total
luminosity of the system is dominated by the central star, then the outflow is
steady. In either case, we find the 2-D structure of the wind consists of a
dense, slow outflow, typically confined to angles within about 45$^o$ of the
equatorial plane, that is bounded on the polar side by a high -velocity, lower
density stream. The flow geometry is controlled largely by the geometry of the
radiation field. Global properties e.g., the total mass loss rate and terminal
velocity depend more on the system luminosity and are insensitive to geometry.
Matter is fed into the fast wind from within a few stellar radii of the central
star. Our solutions agree qualitatively with the kinematics of outflows in CV
systems inferred from spectroscopic observations. We predict that low
luminosity systems may display unsteady behavior in wind-formed spectral lines.
Our study also has application to winds from active galactic nuclei and from

  Nuclei","ApJ (Letters), in press. v2: corrected figure, 11 pages",,"10.1086/311194",,"astro-ph",,"  The compelling dynamical evidence for massive dark objects in galactic nuclei
does not uniquely imply massive black holes (BHs). To argue convincingly that
these objects are BHs we must rule out alternatives to a BH, and the
alternative to a point mass is a cluster of some sort of nonluminous objects,
such as a cluster of brown dwarfs or stellar remnants.
  We use simple physical considerations to derive the maximum possible lifetime
of a dark cluster which may consist of any plausible form of non-luminous
gravitating objects -- from brown dwarfs and very low-mass objects of cosmic
composition, to white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The lower this
limit relative to the galaxy age, the more implausible is the cluster
hypothesis, thus arguing for a point mass. A cluster with a lifetime much
shorter than ~10 Gyr is unacceptable, since observing it at the present epoch
would be highly improbable.
  Since the goal is to rule out a dark cluster by showing that its lifetime
must be very short, we make the most generous assumptions possible under the
observational constraints to allow for its survival. We find that the lifetime
of such an hypothetical cluster must be much shorter than the galaxy age only
in the cases of NGC 4258 and our Galaxy, thus strongly arguing for a point
mass. In all other galaxies, the case of a massive BH, although compelling, is
not yet watertight. We also note that there are two exotic alternatives to a
massive BH that cannot be ruled out even in the cases of NGC 4258 and the
Galaxy: clusters of elementary particles (e.g. bosons), and clusters of very
low-mass BHs. We point out, however, serious difficulties with these
alternatives, and argue that they are highly implausible.

amount of gas encountered along the line of sight depends on the galaxy impact
parameter and B-band luminosity but does not depend strongly on the galaxy
average surface brightness, disk-to-bulge ratio, or redshift. This result
confirms and improves upon the anti-correlation between \lya absorption
equivalent width and galaxy impact parameter found previously by Lanzetta et
al. (1995). There is no evidence that galaxy interactions play an important
role in distributing tenuous gas around galaxies in most cases. Galaxies might
account for all \lya absorption systems with $W > 0.3$ \AA, but this depends on
the unknown luminosity function and gaseous cross sections of low-luminosity
galaxies as well as on the uncertainties of the observed number density of \lya

new test for the cosmological parameters which is insensitive to merger history
of galaxies. The luminosity density evolution in $0<z<1$ observed by the
Canada-France Redshift Survey in three wavebands of 2800{\AA}, 4400{\AA}, and
1$\mu$m indicates that the $\Lambda$-dominated flat universe with

Deep Field including new data which were not incorporated in the previous work

spiral galaxies taking account of gas infall is consistent with the

find [Fe/H]= -2.0 (+/-0.1), [S/H]= -1.54 (+/-0.06) and [N/H]=-2.76 (+/-0.07).
The ratio [Fe/Zn]=-0.44 provides evidence that about 74% of iron and about 28%
of zinc are locked into dust grains with a dust-to-gas ratio of about 3% of the
Galactic one. The total iron content in both gas and dust in the DLA system is
[Fe/H]=-1.4. This confirms a rather low metallicity in the galaxy, which is in
the early stages of its chemical evolution. The detection of SII allows us to
measure the SII/ZnII ratio, which is a unique diagnostic tool for tracing back
its chemical history, since it is not affected by the presence of dust.
Surprisingly, the resulting relative abundance is [S/Zn]=0.0 (+/-0.1), at
variance with the overabundance found in the Galactic halo stars with similar
metallicity. We emphasize that the [S/Zn] ratio is solar in all the three DLA
absorbers with extant data. Upper limits are also found for Mn, Mg, O and P

have -0.1<Fe/H]<0.42 dex. We find that the elemental abundances of Mg, Al, Si,
Ca, Ti, Cr and Ni all follow [Fe/H]. Our data put further constraints on models

al. (1993a) has been confirmed for [Na/Fe]. This upturning relation, and the
scatter around it, are shown not to be due to a mixture of populations with
different mean distances to the galactic centre. We have not been able to trace
any tendency for relative abundances of O, Si, and Ti relative to Fe to vary
with the stellar velocities, i.e. the stars present mean distance to the
galactic centre. These results imply that there is no significant difference in
the chemical evolution of the different stellar populations for stars with
[Me/H]>0.1 dex. SMR stars on highly eccentric orbits, alleged to trace the
evolution of the chemical evolution in the galactic Bulge, have previously been

and astrometry in these crowded images, together with an analysis of the
deficiencies nevertheless remaining, are presented. The numbers of objects
extracted in I,J and K are 748000, 851000 and 659000 respectively, to magnitude
limits of 17,15 and 13. 80% completeness levels typically fall at magnitudes
16, 13 and 10 respectively, fainter by about 2 magnitudes than the usual DENIS
limits due to the crowded nature of these fields. A simple model to describe
the disk contribution to the number counts is constructed, and parameters for
the dust layer derived. We find that a formal fit of parameters for the dust
plane, from these data in limited directions, gives a scalelength and
scaleheight of 3.4+-1.0 kpc and 40+-5 pc respectively, and a solar position
14.0+-2.5 pc below the plane. This latter value is likely to be affected by
localised dust asymmetries. We convolve a detailed model of the systematic and
random errors in the photometry with a simple model of the Galactic disk and
dust distribution, to simulate expected colour-magnitude diagrams. These are in
good agreement with the observed diagrams, allowing us to isolate those stars
from the inner disk and bulge. After correcting for local dust-induced
asymmetries, we find evidence for longitude-dependent asymmetries in the
distant J and K sources, consistent with the general predictions of some
Galactic bar models. We consider complementary L-band observations in a second
paper.

presents two principal regimes: a quasi-rigid rotation in the radiative
interior and a latitude-dependent rotation in the whole convection zone. The
thin layer, named solar tachocline, between these two regimes is difficult to
infer through inverse techniques because of the ill-posed nature of the problem
that requires regularization techniques which, in their global form, tend to
smooth out any high gradient in the solution. Thus, most of the previous
attempts to study the rotation profile of the solar tachocline have been
carried out through forward modeling. In this work we show that some
appropriate inverse techniques can also be used and we compare the ability of
three 1D inverse techniques combined with two automatic strategies for the
choice of the regularization parameter, to infer the solar tachocline profile
in the equatorial plane.

reduced size of the configuration space (compared to related many-particle
models that also show spontaneous symmetry breaking) allows us to study the
spectrum of the time-evolution operator. We break the symmetry explicitly and
find a stable phase, and a meta-stable phase which vanishes at a spinodal
point. At this point, the spectrum of the time evolution operator has a gapless
and universal band of excitations with a dynamical critical exponent z=1.
Surprisingly, the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues E_j(L) are equally spaced,
following the rule Im E_j(L)\propto j/L. Away from the spinodal point, we find
two time scales in the spectrum. These results are related to scaling functions
for the mean path of the random walker and to first passage times. For the
spinodal point, we find universal scaling behavior. A simplified version of the

describing excitations about specific points on the fermi surface, e.g. those
corresponding to the nodes of a d-wave superconducting gap in high-$T_c$
cuprates, condense, resulting in the opening of a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like gap
(KT) at such nodes. In the presence of strong external magnetic fields at the
surface regions of the planar superconductor, in the direction perpendicular to
the superconducting planes, these KT gaps appear to be enhanced. Our
preliminary analysis, based on analytic Scwhinger-Dyson treatments, seems to
indicate that for an even number of Dirac fermion species, required in our
model as a result of gauging a particle-hole SU(2) symmetry, Parity or Time
Reversal violation does not necessarily occurs.Based on these considerations,
we argue that recent experimental findings, concerning thermal conductivity
plateaux of quasiparticles in planar high-$T_c$ cuprates in strong external

Dirac-fermion excitations in these materials, as suggested in the above model.

  Astronomy & Astrophysics","Astron.Astrophys.331:280-290,1998",,"Preprint Observatoire de Paris no 97020","gr-qc astro-ph",,"  An analytical scheme and a numerical method in order to study the effects of
general relativity on the viscosity driven secular bar mode instability of
rapidly rotating stars are presented. The approach consists in perturbing an
axisymmetric and stationary configuration and studying its evolution by
constructing a series of triaxial quasi-equilibrium configurations. These are
obtained by solution of an approximate set of field equations where only the
dominant non-axisymmetric terms are taken into account. The progress with
respect to our former investigation consists in a higher relativistic order of
the non-axisymmetric terms included into the computation, namely the fully
three-dimensional treatment of the vector part of the space-time metric tensor
as opposed to the scalar part, solely, in the former case. The scheme is
applied to rotating stars built on a polytropic equation of state and compared
to our previous results. The 3D-vector part turns out to inhibit the symmetry
breaking efficiently. Nevertheless, the bar mode instability is still possible
for an astrophysically relevant mass of M_ns=1.4 M_sun when a stiff polytropic
equation of state with an adiabatic index of gamma=2.5 is employed. Triaxial
neutron stars may be efficient emitters of gravitational waves and are thus
potentially interesting sources for the forthcoming laser interferometric
gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, VIRGO and GEO600. From a numerical
point of view, the solution of the three-dimensional minimal-distortion shift
vector equation in spherical coordinates is an important achievement of our
code.

in heavy-ion collisions, the size and dynamical state of the collision fireball
at freeze-out can be reconstructed. I discuss the relevant theoretical methods
and their limitations. By applying the formalism to recent pion correlation
data from Pb+Pb collisions at CERN we demonstrate that the collision zone has
undergone strong transverse growth before freeze-out (by a factor 2-3 in each
direction), and that it expands both longitudinally and transversally. From the
thermal and flow energy density at freeze-out the energy density at the onset
of transverse expansion can be estimated from conservation laws. It comfortably
exceeds the critical value for the transition to color deconfined matter.

  Advances in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We apply the theory of high-order harmonic generation by low-frequency laser
fields in the strong field approximation to the study of the spatial and
temporal coherence properties of the harmonics. We discuss the role of
dynamically induced phases of the atomic polarization in determining the
optimal phase matching conditions and angular distributions of harmonics. We
demonstrate that the phase matching and the spatial coherence can be controlled
by changing the focusing parameters of the fundamental laser beam. Then we
present a detailed study of the temporal and spectral properties of harmonics.
We discuss how the focusing conditions influence the individual harmonic
spectra and time profiles, and how the intensity dependence of the dynamically
induced phase leads to a chirp of the harmonic frequency. This phase modulation
can be used to control the temporal and spectral properties of the harmonic
radiation. Temporally, the harmonic chirped pulse can be recompressed to very
small durations. Spectrally, chirping of the fundamental beam may be employed
to compensate for the dynamically induced chirp and to control the individual
harmonic spectrum. Finally, we discuss the short pulse effects, in particular
nonadiabatic phenomena and the possibility of generating attosecond pulses.

using a simplified model of an assembly of atoms (or detectors, which are
particles with some internal degree of freedom) moving in arbitrary
trajectories in a quantum field. Employing the influence functional formalism,
we study the self-consistent effect of the field on the atoms, and their mutual
interactions via coupling to the field. We derive the coupled Langevin
equations for the atom assemblage and analyze the relation of dissipative
dynamics of the atoms with the correlation and fluctuations of the quantum
field. This provides a useful theoretical framework for analysing the coherent
properties of atom-field systems.
