divisor (i.e., a Cartier divisor which is principal on some neighborhood of its

rational equivalences and as a corollary obtain a formula for rational
equivalence between intersections of two locally principal Cartier divisors.
Such canonical rational equivalence applies quite naturally to the setting of
algebraic stacks. We present two applications: (i) a simplification of the
development of Fulton-MacPherson-style intersection theory on Deligne-Mumford
stacks, and (ii) invariance of a key rational equivalence under a certain group
action (which is used in developing the theory of virtual fundamental classes
via intrinsic normal cones).

concentration of young sources points to the existence of a major star
formation region in the Galactic plane, located just inside the assumed origin
of the Scutum spiral arm. Such regions can form due to the concentrations of
shocked gas where a galactic bar meets a spiral arm, as is observed at the ends
of the bars of face-on external galaxies. Thus, the presence of a massive star

hundred times more luminous than any supernova. Therefore, a name `hypernova'
is proposed for the whole GRB/afterglow event.
  There is tentative evidence that the GRBs: 970228, 970508, and 970828 were
close to star forming regions. If this case is strengthened with future
afterglows then the popular model in which GRBs are caused be merging neutron
stars will have to be abandoned, and a model linking GRBs to cataclysmic deaths
of massive stars will be favored. The presence of X-ray precursors, first
detected with Ginga, is easier to understand within a framework of a `dirty'
rather than a `clean' fireball. A very energetic explosion of a massive star is
likely to create a dirty fireball, rather than a clean one.
  A specific speculative example of such an explosion is proposed, a
microquasar. Its geometrical structure is similar to the `failed supernova' of
Woosley (1993a): the inner core of a massive, rapidly rotating star collapses
into a ~ 10 solar mass Kerr black hole with ~ 5 x 10^54 erg of rotational
energy, while the outer core forms a massive disk/torus. A superstrong ~ 10^15
G magnetic field is needed to make the object operate as a microquasar similar
to the Blandford & Znajek (1977) model. Such events must be vary rare, 10^4 -
10^5 times less common than ordinary supernovae, if they are to account for the

order of magnitude denser than that of the Virgo cluster, and so this analysis
allows us to explore the X-ray properties of individual galaxies in the richest

together, we have shown that their emission appears to be marginally resolved
by the HRI. This extent is smaller than for galaxies in poorer environments,
and is comparable to the size of the galaxies in optical light. These facts
suggest that the detected X-ray emission originates from the stellar
populations of the galaxies, rather than from extended hot interstellar media.
Support for this hypothesis comes from placing the optical and X-ray
luminosities of these galaxies in the L_B - L_X plane: the galaxies of Abell
2634 lie in the region of this plane where models indicate that all the X-ray
emission can be explained by the usual population of X-ray binaries. It is
therefore probable that ram pressure stripping has removed the hot gas

semi-analytical one as it combines analytical relationships derived from
complete models of TP-AGB stars with sole envelope models in which the physical
structure is calculated from the photosphere down to the core. Our efforts are
directed to analyse the effects produced by envelope burning, such as: i) the
energy contribution which may drive significant deviations from the standard
core mass-luminosity relationship; and ii) the changes in the surface chemical
composition due to nuclear burning via the CNO cycle. Evolutionary models for
stars with initial mass of 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 Mo and two choices of the initial
chemical composition ([Y=0.28,Z=0.02] and [Y=0.25,Z=0.008]) are calculated from
the first thermal pulse till the complete ejection of the envelope. We find
that massive TP-AGB stars can rapidly reach high luminosities (-6>Mbol>-7),
without exceeding, however, the classical limit to the AGB luminosity of
Mbol~-7.1 corresponding to the Chandrasekhar value of the core mass. No carbon
stars brighter than Mbol~-6.5 are predicted to form (the alternative of a
possible transition from M-star to C-star during the final pulses is also
explored), in agreement with observations which indicate that most of the very
luminous AGB stars are oxygen-rich. Finally, new chemical yields from stars in
the mass range 4-5 Mo are presented, so as to extend the sets of stellar yields
from low-mass stars already calculated by Marigo et al. (1996). For each CNO

show that this code successfully resolves the shock wave in both the

all the expected features -- including the optically thin temperature spike at
a supercritical shock front -- without invoking analytic jump conditions at the
discontinuity. We solve the full moment equations for the radiation flux and
energy density, but the shock wave structure can also be reproduced if the
radiation flux is assumed to be proportional to the gradient of the energy
density (the diffusion approximation), as long as the radiation energy density
is determined by the appropriate radiative transfer moment equation.

structure accurately describes a subcritical shock but it underestimates the
gas temperature, pressure, and the radiation flux in the gas ahead of a
supercritical shock. We argue that this discrepancy is a consequence of
neglecting terms which are second order in the minimum shock compression ratio
[$\eta_1 = (\gamma-1)/(\gamma+1)$, where $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index] and
the inaccurate treatment of radiative transfer near the discontinuity. In
addition, we verify that the maximum temperature of the gas immediately behind

prediction of atmospheric flows are nonlinear and computer realizations give
unrealistic solutions because of deterministic chaos, a direct consequence of
finite precision round-off error doubling for each iteration of iterative

of wetting based on a single collective coordinate \ell representing the
position of the unbinding fluid interface. Problems (P1) and (P2) refer to the
predictions of non-universality at the upper critical dimension d=3 at critical
and complete wetting respectively which are not borne out by Ising model
simulation studies. (P3) relates to mean-field correlation function structure
in the underlying continuum Landau model. We investigate the hypothesis that
these concerns arise due to the coupling of order parameter fluctuations near
the unbinding interface and wall. For quite general choices of collective
coordinates X_i we show that arbitrary two-field models H[X_1,X_2] can recover
the required anomalous structure of mean-field correlation functions (P3). To
go beyond mean-field theory we introduce a set of Hamiltonians based on proper
collective coordinates s near the wall which have both interfacial and
spin-like components. We argue that an optimum model H[s,\ell] in which the
degree of coupling is controlled by an angle-like variable, best describes the
non-universality of the Ising model and investigate its critical behaviour. For
critical wetting the appropriate Ginzburg criterion shows that the true
asymptotic critical regime for the local susceptibility \chi_1 is dramatically
reduced consistent with observations of mean-field behaviour in simulations
(P1). For complete wetting the model yields a precise expression for the
temperature dependence of the renormalized critical amplitude \theta in good
agreement with simulations (P2). We highlight the importance of a new wetting
parameter which describes the physics that emerges due to the coupling effects.

single $W$ production at a 200 GeV $e^+e^-$ collider in the Weizacker-Williams

PT invariance, but they are not symmetric under parity reflection or time

this idea to a two-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory whose
superpotential is ${\cal S}(\phi)=-ig(i\phi)^{1+\delta}$. The resulting quantum
field theory exhibits a broken parity symmetry for all $\delta>0$. However,
supersymmetry remains unbroken, which is verified by showing that the

theory. In this case, the topological sigma model can be understood as an
adiabatic limit of the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional supersymmetric
Yang-Mills on the eight-dimensional manifold M x K of holonomy Sp(1) x Sp(1) in
Spin(7), which is a cohomological theory localising on the moduli space of

$T$-module. Then, as in \cite{go1}, one can construct associated characteristic
$p$ $L$-functions based on the classical model of abelian varieties {\it once}
certain auxiliary choices are made. Our purpose in this paper is to show how
the well-known concept of ``maximal separable (over the completion $\k_\infty$)
subfield'' allows one to construct from such $L$-functions certain separable
extensions which are independent of these choices. These fields will then
depend only on the isogeny class of the original $T$-module or Drinfeld module
and $y\in \Zp$, and should presumably be describable in these terms. Moreover,
they give a very useful framework in which to view the ``Riemann hypothesis''
evidence of \cite{w1}, \cite{dv1}, \cite{sh1}. We also establish that an
element which is {\it separably} algebraic over $\k_\infty$ can be realized as
a ``multi-valued operator'' on general $T$-modules. This is very similar to
realizing 1/2 as the multi-valued operator $x\mapsto \sqrt{x}$ on $\C^\ast$.
Simple examples show that this result is false for non-separable elements. This
result may eventually allow a ``two $T$'s'' interpretation of the above
extensions in terms of multi-valued operators on $E$ and certain tensor twists.
