by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma-ray
Observatory (CGRO) since the observatory became operational in May 1991.
Between the summer of 1991 and the fall of 1996, eight outbursts from GX339-4
were observed. The history of these outbursts is one of declining fluence or
total energy release, as well as a shortening of the time between outbursts. A
rough linear correlation exists between the fluence emitted during an outburst
and the time elapsed between the end of the previous outburst and the beginning
of the current one. The peak flux is also roughly linearly correlated with
outburst fluence. The lightcurves of the earlier, more intense, outbursts
(except for the second one) can be modeled by a fast exponential (time constant
~ 10 days) followed by a slower exponential (~ 100 days) on the rise and a fast
exponential decay (~ 5 days) on the fall. The later, weaker, outbursts are
modeled with a single rising time constant (~ 20 days) and a longer decay on
the fall (~ 50 days). An exponential model gives a marginally better fit than a
power law to the rise/decay profiles. GX339-4 is a unique source in having more
frequent outbursts than other low mass x-ray binary black hole candidates.
These observations can be used to constrain models of the behavior of the
accretion disk surrounding the compact object.

inverse problem in the analysis of interstellar (intergalactic) absorption
lines is presented. We consider the process of line formation in media with a
stochastic velocity field accounting for the effects of a finite correlation
length (mesoturbulence). This approach generalizes the standard microturbulent
approximation, which is commonly used to model the formation of absorption
spectra in turbulent media. The method allows to estimate from an observed
spectrum both, the physical parameters of the absorbing gas, and an appropriate
structure of the velocity distribution parallel to the line of sight. The
procedure is applied to a template H+D Ly-alpha profile which reproduces the
Burles and Tytler [BT] spectrum of the quasar Q 1009+2956 with the DI Ly-alpha
line seen at the redshift z = 2.504. The results obtained favor a low D/H ratio
in this particular absorption system, although the inferred upper limit for the
hydrogen isotopic ratio of about 4.6 10^{-5} is slightly higher than that of BT
[log (D/H) = -4.60 +/- 0.08 +/- 0.06,i.e. D/H <= 3.47 10^{-5}]. This revision
of the BT data in the framework of the mesoturbulent model leads to limits on
D/H consistent with standard big bang nucleosynthesis [SBBN] predictions and
observational constraints on both extra-galactic 4He mass fraction Y_p (Izotov
et al. 1997) and 7Li abundance in the atmospheres of population II (halo) stars
(Bonifacio and Molaro 1997). SBBN restricts the common interval of the baryon
to photon ratio \eta for which there is concordance between the various
abundances to 3.9 10^{-10} <= \eta <= 5.3 10^{-10}. It implies that 0.014 <=

a third event at z=0.97 (SN 1997ck). The superb spatial resolution of HST
separates each supernova from its host galaxy and leads to good precision in
the light curves. The HST data combined with ground-based photometry provide
good temporal coverage. We use these light curves and relations between
luminosity, light curve shape, and color calibrated from low-z samples to
derive relative luminosity distances which are accurate to 10% at z~0.5 and 20%
at z=1. The redshift-distance relation is used to place constraints on the
global mean matter density, Omega_matter, and the normalized cosmological
constant, Omega_Lambda. When the HST sample is combined with the distance to SN
1995K (z=0.48), analyzed by the same precepts, it suggests that matter alone is
insufficient to produce a flat Universe. Specifically, for
Omega_matter+Omega_Lambda=1, Omega_matter is less than 1 with >95% confidence,
and our best estimate of Omega_matter is -0.1 +/- 0.5 if Omega_Lambda=0.

adjusted to agree with the observed cosmic-ray Boron/Carbon ratio, and the

  The predicted positron fraction is in good agreement with the measurements up

the positron fraction is now accurately measured in the 1-10 GeV range our

extremely simple. Only the mass distribution varies as a function of

that the energy cascades almost entirely perpendicular to the local magnetic
field. As a result, the cyclotron resonance is unimportant in dissipating the
turbulent energy. Motivated by the GS cascade, we calculate the linear
collisionless dissipation of Alfven waves with frequencies much less than the
proton cyclotron frequency, but with perpendicular wavelengths of order the
Larmor radius of thermal protons. In plasmas appropriate to hot accretion flows
(proton temperature much greater than electron temperature) the dissipated
Alfven wave energy primarily heats the protons. For a plasma with $\beta \lsim
5$, however, where $\beta$ is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic
pressure, the MHD assumptions utilized in the GS analysis break down before
most of the energy in Alfven waves is dissipated; how the cascade then proceeds
is unclear. Hot accretion flows, such as advection dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs), are expected to contain significant levels of MHD turbulence. This
work suggests that, for $\beta \gsim 5$, the Alfvenic component of such
turbulence primarily heats the protons. Significant proton heating is required
for the viability of ADAF models. We contrast our results on particle heating
in ADAFs with recent work by Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Lovelace (1997).

metal insulator transitions in both the fractional ($\nu < 1/3$) and integer

dependence of various susceptibilities confirm the previous conclusion of the
absence of a phase transition down to $m_q=0.02$. At $m_q=0.01$ an increase of
susceptibilities is observed up to the largest volume $16^3$ explored in the
present work. We argue, however, that this increase is likely to be due to an
artifact of too small a lattice size and it cannot be taken to be the evidence
for a first-order transition. Analysis of critical exponents estimated from the
quark mass dependence of susceptibilities shows that they satisfy hyperscaling
consistent with a second-order transition located at $m_q=0$. The exponents
obtained from larger lattice, however, deviate significantly from both those of
O(2), which is the exact symmetry group of the Kogut-Susskind action at finite
lattice spacing, and those of O(4) expected from an effective sigma model

  and wave fronts",,,,"FI-ST1997-011","math.DG",,"  The Chekanov theorem generalizes the classic Lyusternik-Shnirel'man and Morse
theorems concerning critical points of a smooth function on a closed manifold.
A Legendrian submanifold \Lambda of space of 1-jets of the functions on a
manifold M defines a multi-valued function whose graph is the projection of
\Lambda in J^0 M = M x R. The Chekanov theorem asserts that if \Lambda is
homotopic to the 1-jet of a smooth function in the class of embedded Legendrian
manifolds, then such a graph of a multi-valued function must have a lot of
points (their number is determined by the topology of M) at which the tangent
plane to the graph is parallel to M \times 0.
  In the present paper a similar estimate is proved for a wider class of
Legendrian manifolds. We consider Legendrian manifolds homotopic (in the class
of embedded Legendrian manifolds) to Legendrian manifolds specified by
generating families.

dimensional cranked HFB (3d-CHFB) states are analyzed quantitatively in the
context of the relation between the signature of an intrinsic symmetry and the
parity of angular momentum, (-1)^I. We found that the tilted states have
favorable features to describe states involved with high-K quantum number
and/or odd total angular momentum. This implies that 3d-CHFB can describe
properly the backbending phenomena like a ""t-band and g-band"" crossing, which
is suggested in N=106 isotopes.
