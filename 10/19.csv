  Intersections in Grassmannians","36 pages, LaTeX 2.09",,"10.1016/S0550-3213(98)00020-0",,"alg-geom hep-th math.AG",,"  In this paper we show that conifold transitions between Calabi-Yau 3-folds
can be used for the construction of mirror manifolds and for the computation of
the instanton numbers of rational curves on complete intersection Calabi-Yau
3-folds in Grassmannians. Using a natural degeneration of Grassmannians
$G(k,n)$ to some Gorenstein toric Fano varieties $P(k,n)$ with conifolds
singularities which was recently described by Sturmfels, we suggest an explicit
mirror construction for Calabi-Yau complete intersections $X \subset G(k,n)$ of
arbitrary dimension. Our mirror construction is consistent with the formula for
the Lax operator conjectured by Eguchi, Hori and Xiong for gravitational
quantum cohomology of Grassmannians.

  for Nonthermal Processes","15 pages (Latex), 4 figures (eps). ApJ Letters in press (1997)",,"10.1086/311063",,"astro-ph",,"  Transient microwave brightenings (TMBs) are small-scale energy releases from
the periphery of sunspot umbrae, with a flux density two orders of magnitude
smaller than that from a typical flare. Gopalswamy et al (1994) first reported
the detection of the TMBs and it was pointed out that the radio emission
implied a region of very high magnetic field so that the emission mechanism has
to be gyroresonance or nonthermal gyrosynchrotron, but not free-free emission.
It was not possible to decide between gyroresonance and gyrosynchrotron
processes because of the low time resolution (30 s) used in the data analysis.
We have since performed a detailed analysis of the Very Large Array data with
full time resolution (3.3 s) at two wavelengths (2 and 3.6 cm) and we can now
adequately address the question of the emission mechanism of the TMBs. We find
that nonthermal processes indeed take place during the TMBs. We present
evidence for nonthermal emission in the form of temporal and spatial structure
of the TMBs. The fast time structure cannot be explained by a thermodynamic
cooling time and therefore requires a nonthermal process. Using the physical
parameters obtained from X-ray and radio observations, we determine the
magnetic field parameters of the loop and estimate the energy released during
the TMBs. The impulsive components of TMBs imply an energy release rate of 1.3
x 10^22 erg/s so that the thermal energy content of the TMBs could be less than
10^24 erg.

through the barrier but decreases the crossing of the barrier for the energies
above the barrier. As a particular application, the case of decay from the

  Ferroelectrics","7 pages, 6 eps figures included using psfig",,,"TIFR/TH/1997-50","cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  We present a simple theory for structural transitions in displacive
ferroelectrics of the perovskite type. In our theory, the competition between
the elastic energy cost for the displacement of the homopolar ion from the
centrosymmetric position, and the energy gain due to a ferroelectric ordering
of the dipoles formed by the ionic displacements, leads naturally to a
first-order transition from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric phase. This
transition takes place at a certain temperature $T_c(L)$ as the temperature is
decreased and, at a certain size $L_c (T)$ as the size of the system is
increased. The transition temperature $T_c (L)$ is suppressed as the sample
size is reduced, and vanishes for samples below a certain size. For
order-disorder ferroelectrics, our theory shows that the suppression of $T_c$
by a reduction in system size is not appreciable, a result that is borne out by
experiments.

are shown to exhibit a motional squeezing which tends to space them more
regularly rather than strictly at random, and evidence a sub-Poissonian

(anti)correlation among carriers is demonstrated to be a collective effect
which persists over the transit of several successive electrons and results in
a considerable (more than one order of magnitude) shot noise suppression.

necessary in the general case. Expressions for the amplitudes of processes
involving both massive and massless particles are presented. These expressions
make it possible to create in an easy way the computer programs for automatic

of quantized gauge field interacted with a money flow field. The gauge
transformations of the matter field correspond to a dilatation of security
units which effect is eliminated by a gauge transformation of the connection.
The curvature tensor for the connection consists of the excess returns to the
risk-free interest rate for the local arbitrage operation. Free quantum gauge
theory is equivalent to the assumption about the log-normal walks of assets
prices. In general case the consideration maps the capital market onto lattice
QED.
