our desire to find examples for a long standing problem in adjunction theory.
Andreatta followed by a generalization by Ein and Lazarsfeld posed the problem
of classifying smooth n-dimensional varieties (X,L) polarized with a very ample
line bundle L, such that the adjoint linear system |H| = |K + (n-1)L| gives an
embedding which is not projectively normal. After a detailed check of the non
projectively normal surfaces found in this work no examples were found except
possibly a blow up of an elliptic P^1-bundle whose existence is uncertain.

partially ionized zones; radiative fluorescence is relatively less effective.
Further evidence for high density zones is derived from the [O I] and [Ni II]

the nebula. The ionization structure of iron in Orion is modeled using the
newly calculated atomic data, showing some significant differences from
previous models. The new model suggests a fully ionized H II region at
densities on the order of $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, and a dynamic partially ionized H
II/H I region at densities of $10^5-10^7$ \cm3. Photoionization models also

As suggested in Paper II, energy density filaments could have been produced by
subjacent magnetic flux tubes when the Universe was dominated by radiation. In
more recent time epochs, small scale filaments have evolved in a complicated
way, but large scale filaments have probably survived and should be identified
with present observed matter filaments of clusters. A primordial magnetic field
lattice made up of magnetic flux tubes would then have originated a matter
lattice made up of cluster filaments. Taking into account some restrictions in
the magnetic field configuration we speculate what type of matter network this
would have generated. The simplest lattice is made up of octohedra connected at
their vertexes, reminding us of a structure of superimposed egg cartons. The
vertexes would correspond to large superclusters, which would therefore have
eight filaments emerging from them. Some observational evidence is found in the
Local Supercluster, which is spider-like, with eight legs.

Two-dimensional simulations of self-gravitating supersonic MHD and hydrodynamic

filamentary density structures and a power-law density pdf with logarithmic
slope around -1.7. This suggests that the functional form of the pdf and the
general filamentary morphology are the signature of the nonlinear advection
operator. These results do not support previous claims that the pdf is
lognormal. A series of 1D simulations of forced supersonic polytropic
turbulence is used to resolve the discrepancy. They suggest that the pdf is
lognormal only for effective polytropic indices $\gamma=1$ (or nearly lognormal
for $\gamma\not=1$ if the Mach number is sufficiently small), while power laws
develop at high densities if $\gamma<1$. We evaluate the polytropic index for
conditions relevant to the cool interstellar medium using published cooling
functions and different heating sources, finding that a lognormal pdf may occur
at densities between 10$^3$ and at least 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. Several applications
are examined. First, we question a recent derivation of the IMF from the
density pdf by Padoan, Nordlund & Jones because a) the pdf does not contain
spatial information, and b) their derivation produces the most massive stars in
the voids of the density distribution. Second, we illustrate how a distribution

to zero dispersion yields for the velocity of the Sun w.r.t. the LSR in km/s:
U_0=10.00+/-0.36 (radially inwards), V_0=5.23+/-0.62 (in direction of galactic
rotation), and W_0=7.17+/-0.38 (vertically upwards). A plot of velocity
dispersion vs. colour beautifully shows Parenago's discontinuity: the
dispersion is constant for B-V>0.62 and decreases towards bluer colour.
  We determine the velocity-dispersion tensor sigma^2_ij as function of B-V.
The mixed moments involving vertical motion are zero within the errors, while
sigma^2_xy is non-zero at about (10km/s)^2 independent of colour. The resulting
vertex deviations are about 20 deg for early-type stars and 10+/-4 deg for
old-disc stars. The persistence of the vertex deviation to late-type stars
implies that the Galactic potential is significantly non-axisymmetric at the
solar radius. If spiral arms are responsible for this, they cannot be tightly
wound. Except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1 the ratios of the principal velocity
dispersions are 2.2 : 1.4 :1, while the absolute values increase with colour
from sigma_1=20km/s at B-V=0.2 to sigma_1=38km/s at Parenago's discontinuity

electromigration in various host metals having a close-packed lattice

wind valences are found, which make these metals attractive candidates for the

output itself is given by a general, permutation-invariant Boolean function of
the outputs of the hidden units. As a result we find that the phase
transitions, which we found in the deterministic case, mostly persist in the
presence of noise. The influence of the noise on the position of the phase
transition, as well as on the behaviour in other regimes of the loading
parameter $\alpha$, can often be described by a simple rescaling of $\alpha$
depending on strength and type of the noise. We then consider the problem of
the optimal noise level for Gibbsian and Bayesian learning, looking on replica
symmetry breaking as well. Finally we consider the question why learning with

phase structure agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations for small Higgs
masses, but, at least to the order calculated, the technique is less sensitive
to the expected evolution of the transition to a crossover for Higgs masses

the cosmic microwave background have been interpreted as requiring that
neutrinos provide about 20% of the critical density. However the need for such
`hot' dark matter is removed if the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations
is tilted below scale-invariance, as is often the case in physically realistic
inflationary models. This question will be resolved by forthcoming precision
measurements of microwave background anisotropy on small angular scales. This

spectrum that can be calculated at weak coupling using conventional
semi-classical methods. In particular, the magnetic charges are co-root vectors
as required by the Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization condition.

equivalent thickness of gold in one element was measured by observing the

radiation with photon energies above the L3 absorption edge of gold. The
results obtained at 4 different photon energies below the L2 edge yield an
average value of 22.4(35) nm which is consistent with the earlier result
extracted from detection efficiency measurements.

described in terms of quantum logic operations since the conditional dynamics
implicit in quantum logic is central to the creation of entanglement. Keeping
with current interest, some experimental issues in the proposal for trapped-ion
quantum computation by I. Cirac and P. Zoller (University of Innsbruck) are
discussed. Several possible decoherence mechanisms are examined and what may be
the more important of these are identified. Some potential applications for
entangled states of trapped-ions which lie outside the immediate realm of

  size","15 pages RevTeX + 7 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.57.2021",,"quant-ph",,"  Atomic diffraction through double slits and transmission gratings is well
described in terms of the associated de Broglie waves and classical wave
optics. However, for weakly bound and relatively large systems, such as the
He_2 dimer, this might no longer hold true due to the possibility of break-up
processes and finite-size effects. We therefore study the diffraction of weakly
bound two-particle systems. If the bar and slit widths of the grating are much
larger than the diameter of the two-particle system we recover the usual optics
results. For smaller widths, however, deviations therefrom occur. We find that
the location of possible diffraction peaks is indeed still governed by the
usual grating function from optics, but the peaks may have a lower intensity.
This is not unexpected when break-up processes are allowed. More unusually
though, diffraction peaks which would be absent for de Broglie waves may
reappear. The results are illustrated for diffraction of He_2.
