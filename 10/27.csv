high- resolution images, which we apply to the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). Our
procedure is to k-correct the pixels belonging to the images of a complete set
of bright galaxies and then to replicate each galaxy image to higher redshift
by the product of its space density, 1/V_{max}, and the cosmological volume.
The set of bright galaxies is itself selected from the HDF because presently
the HDF provides the highest quality UV images of a redshift-complete sample of
galaxies (31 galaxies with I<21.9, \bar{z}=0.5, and for which V/V_{max} is
spread fairly). These galaxies are bright enough to permit accurate
pixel-by-pixel k-corrections into the restframe UV (\sim 2000 A). We match the
shot noise, spatial sampling and PSF smoothing of the HDF, resulting in
entirely empirical and parameter free ``no-evolution'' deep fields of galaxies
for direct comparison with the HDF. We obtain the following results. Faint HDF
galaxies (I>24) are much smaller, more numerous, and less regular than our
``no-evolution'' extrapolation, for any relevant geometry. A higher proportion
of HDF galaxies ``dropout'' in both U and B, indicating that some galaxies were
brighter at higher redshifts than our ``cloned'' z\sim0.5 population. By simple
image transformations we demonstrate that bolometric luminosity evolution
generates galaxies which are too large and the contribution of any evolving
dwarf population is uninterestingly small. A plausible fit is provided by
`mass-conserving' density-evolution, consistent with hierarchical growth of
small-scale structure. Finally, we show the potential for improvement using the
Advanced Camera, with its superior UV and optical performance.

in a boundary overdensity which most likely marks the inner edge of a bubble

Beyond this bubble is a rich collection of interstellar structures revealed by

dynamical and age information by establishing the kinematics of the gas, both
on interstellar and circumstellar scales. These reveal, for instance, a
timescale for the outer circumstellar rings which is in close agreement with

spectroscopic observations of the prototype dwarf nova U Geminorum during dwarf
nova quiescence, 13 days and 61 days following the end of a narrow outburst.
The spectral wavelength ranges were centered upon three different line regions:
N V (1238\AA, 1242\AA), Si III (1300\AA) and He II (1640\AA). All of the
quiescent spectra at both epochs are dominated by absorption lines and show no
emission features. The Si III and He II absorption line velocities versus
orbital phase trace the orbital motion of the white dwarf but the N~V
absorption velocities appear to deviate from the white dwarf motion. We confirm
our previously reported low white dwarf rotational velocity, V sin i= 100 km/s.
We obtain a white dwarf orbital velocity semi-amplitude K1=107 km/s. Using the
gamma-velocity of Wade (1981) we obtain an Einstein redshift of 80.4 km/s and
hence a carbon core white dwarf mass of ~1.1 Msun. We report the first subsolar
chemical abundances of C and Si for U Gem with C down by 0.05 with respect to
the Sun, almost certainly a result of C depletion due to thermonuclear
processing. This C-depletion is discussed within the framework of a weak TNR,
contamination of the secondary during the common envelope phase, and mixing of
C-depleted white dwarf gas with C-depleted matter deposited during a dwarf nova
event. Remarkably the Teff of the white dwarf 13 days after outburst is only
32,000K, anomalously cooler than previous early post-outburst measurements.
Extensive cooling during an extraordinarily long (210 days) quiescence followed
by accretion onto an out-of-equilibrium cooled degenerate could explain the
lower Teff.

They inferred the presence of this dust from the remarkably broad range of B-K

dust is typical of QSOs, it will have rendered invisible most of those which
would otherwise been have detected by optical surveys. We used the William
Herschel Telescope on La Palma to obtain K infrared images of 54 B3 radio
quasars selected at low frequency (mainly steep-spectrum), and we find that
although several have very red optical-infrared colours, most of these can be
attributed to an excess of light in K rather than a dust-induced deficit in B.
We present evidence that some of the infrared excess comes from the light of
stars in the host galaxy (some, as previously suggested, comes from synchrotron
radiation associated with flat-spectrum radio sources). The B-K colours of the
B3 QSOs provide no evidence for a large reddened population. Either the Webster
et al QSOs are atypical in having such large extinctions, or their reddening is
not due to dust; either way, the broad range of their B-K colours does not
provide evidence that a large fraction of QSOs has been missed from optical
surveys.

(rms(Gns)) relative to that in the normal state (rms(Gn)) by a factor of 2.8.
In this comment, we argue that the measured rms(Gns) is NOT significantly
enhanced compared to rms(Gn) when we correct for the presence of an incoherent

D, 57, 7241 (1998)","10.1103/PhysRevD.57.7241","IUCAA Preprint 55/97","physics.class-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  We study the electromagnetic fields of an arbitrarily moving charged particle
and the radiation reaction on the charged particle using a novel approach. We
first show that the fields of an arbitrarily moving charged particle in an
inertial frame can be related in a simple manner to the fields of a uniformly
accelerated charged particle in its rest frame. Since the latter field is
static and easily obtainable, it is possible to derive the fields of an
arbitrarily moving charged particle by a coordinate transformation. More
importantly, this formalism allows us to calculate the self-force on a charged
particle in a remarkably simple manner. We show that the original expression
for this force, obtained by Dirac, can be rederived with much less computation
and in an intuitively simple manner using our formalism.

affine Hecke algebra of gl_N and analyze their structure mainly by means of
intertwiners. We also construct them from modules of the affine Lie algebra
using Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connections in the conformal field theory. This
construction provides a natural quotient of induced modules, which turns out to
be the unique irreducible one under a certain condition. Some cunjectual
formulas are presented for the symmetric part of these quotients.

three-dimensional (3D) cavity and in a waveguide with oscillating boundaries of
the frequency $\Omega $. The photons created by the parametric resonance are
distributed in the wave number space around $\Omega/2 $ along the axis of the
oscillation. When classical waves propagate along the waveguide in the one
direction, we observe the amplification of the original waves and another wave
generation in the opposite direction by the oscillation of side walls. This can
be understood as the classical counterpart of the photon production. In the
case of two opposite walls oscillating with the same frequency but with a phase
difference, the interferences are shown to occur due to the phase difference in
the photon numbers and in the intensity of the generated waves.

cotangent to the moduli space $N$ of holomorphic $SL_2$-bundles over a smooth
complex curve of genus two. $N$ may be identified with the 3-dimensional
projective space of theta functions of the second order, We prove that the
Hitchin system on $T^*N$ possesses a remarkable symmetry: it is invariant under
the interchange of positions and momenta. This property allows to complete the
work of van Geemen-Previato which, basing on the classical results on geometry
of the Kummer quartic surfaces, specified the explicit form of the Hamiltonians
of the Hitchin system. The resulting integrable system resembles the classic
Neumann systems which are also self-dual. Its quantization produces a commuting
family of differential operators of the second order acting on homogeneous
polynomials in four complex variables. As recently shown by van Geemen-de Jong,
these operators realize the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard-Hitchin connection
for group SU(2) and genus 2 curves.
