magnetic flares arise above the cold accretion disk due to magnetic buoyancy
and produce X-rays via Comptonization of the disk's soft radiation. We find
that the disk's ability to produce strong magnetic flares is substantially
diminished in its radiation dominated regions due to the diffusion of radiation
into the magnetic flux tubes. Using a simplified, yet physically
self-consistent, model that takes this effect into account, we show that the
hard X-ray spectrum of some GBHCs can be explained as the X-ray emission by
magnetic flares only when the disk's bolometric luminosity is a relatively
small fraction ($\sim$ 5%) of the Eddington value, $L_{Edd}$. Further, we
compute the hard ($20-200$ keV) and soft ($1-20$ keV) X-ray power as a function
of the disk's luminosity, and find an excellent agreement with the available
data for GBHC transient and persistent sources. We conclude that the observed
high-energy spectrum of stellar-sized accretion disk systems can be explained
by Comptonization of the disk's soft radiation by the hot gas trapped inside
the magnetic flares when the luminosity falls in the range $\sim
10^{-3}-10^{-1}\times L_{Edd}$. For higher luminosities, another emission
mechanism must be at work. For lower luminosities, the X-ray emissivity may
still be dominated by magnetic flares, but this process is more likely to be
thermal or non-thermal bremstrahlung, so that the X-ray spectrum below $\sim

gravitational lensing. Our results for a sample of 13 clusters provide a
consistent description of the distribution of gravitating matter in these
systems. For the 6 cooling-flow clusters in the sample, which are the more
dynamically-relaxed systems, the X-ray and strong gravitational lensing mass
measurements show excellent agreement. The core radii for the mass
distributions are small, with a mean value of ~ 50 $h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc.
  For the non-cooling flow clusters, the masses determined from the strong
lensing data exceed the X-ray values by factors of $2-4$. However, significant
offsets between the X-ray and lensing centres are observed, indicating that the
X-ray and strong-lensing data are probing different lines of sight through the
clusters. These offsets, and the generally complex dynamical states of the
clusters inferred from their X-ray morphologies, lensing data and galaxy
distributions, suggest that the gravitational potentials in the central regions
of the non-cooling flow systems are evolving rapidly, and that the assumption
of hydrostatic equilibrium involved in the X-ray mass measurements is likely to
have broken down. The discrepancies between the X-ray and strong lensing mass
measurements may be reconciled if the dynamical activity has caused the X-ray
analyses to overestimate the core radii of the dominant mass clumps in these
clusters. On larger spatial scales, comparisons of the X-ray mass results with
measurements from weak gravitational lensing show excellent agreement for both
cooling-flow and non-cooling flow clusters. (ABRIDGED)

3-sigma upper limits of [CII]/FIR < 0.5-2 x 10^{-4}. The trend in the [CII]/FIR
ratio with the temperature of dust and with star-formation activity may be due
to decreased efficiency of photoelectric heating of gas at high UV radiation
intensity as dust grains become positively charged, decreasing the yield and
the energy of the photoelectrons. The three galaxies with no observed PDR lines
have among the highest ratios of FIR to Blue luminosity and the ratio of 60 and
100 micron emission. Their lack of [CII] lines may be due to a continuing trend
of decreasing [CII]/FIR with increasing star-formation activity and dust
temperature seen in one-third of the sample with warm IRAS colors. In that case
the upper limits on [CII]/FIR imply a ratio of UV flux to gas density G_0/n >

self-absorption or strong FIR continuum from regions weak in [CII], such as

giant metallic A and F stars (defined by an enhanced value of the blanketing
parameter Delta_m_2 of the Geneva photometry) when they evolve.
  If this hypothesis is right, Am and metallic A-FIII stars need to have the
same rate of binaries and a similar distribution of vsini. From our new
spectroscopic data and from vsini and radial velocities in the literature, we
show that it is not the case. The metallic giant stars are often fast rotators
with vsini larger than 100 km/s, while the maximum rotational velocity for Am
stars is about 100 km/s. The rate of tight binaries with periods less than 1000
days is less than 30 percent among metallic giants, which is incompatible with
the value of 75 percent for Am stars (Abt & Levy 1985). Therefore, the simplest
way to explain the existence of giant metallic F stars is to suggest that all
normal A and early F stars might go through a short ""metallic"" phase when they
are finishing their life on the main sequence.
  Besides, it is shown that only giant stars with spectral type comprised
between F0 and F6 may have a really enhanced Delta_m_2 value, while all A-type

How are SNR dynamics and structures modified by the character of the CSM and

magnetic fields influence SNRs? Where and how are cosmic-rays (electrons and

and more precisely determined by means of tools from distribution theory and
summability theory. (These are the same, insofar as recently the classic
Cesaro-Riesz theory of summability of series and integrals has been given a
distributional interpretation.) When applied to the spectral analysis of Green
functions (which are then to be expanded as series in a parameter, usually the
time), these methods show: (1) The ""local"" or ""global"" dependence of the
expansion coefficients on the background geometry, etc., is determined by the
regularity of the asymptotic expansion of the integrand at the origin (in
""frequency space""); this marks the difference between a heat kernel and a
Wightman two-point function, for instance. (2) The behavior of the integrand at
infinity determines whether the expansion of the Green function is genuinely
asymptotic in the literal, pointwise sense, or is merely valid in a
distributional (cesaro-averaged) sense; this is the difference between the heat
kernel and the Schrodinger kernel. (3) The high-frequency expansion of the
spectral density itself is local in a distributional sense (but not pointwise).
These observations make rigorous sense out of calculations in the physics
literature that are sometimes dismissed as merely formal.

  General Relativity",,,,"gr-qc",,"  We discuss (3+1) dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of
close neutron star binary systems. The relativistic field equations are solved
at each time slice with a spatial 3-metric chosen to be conformally flat.
Against this solution the hydrodynamic variables and gravitational radiation
are allowed to respond. We have studied four physical processes which occur as
the stars approach merger. These include: 1) the relaxation to a hydrodynamic
state of almost no spin; 2) relativistically driven compression, heating, and
neutrino emission; 3) collapse to two black holes; and 4) orbit inspiral
occurring at a lower frequency than previously expected. We give a brief
account of the physical origin of these effects and an explanation of why they
do not appear in models based upon, 1PN hydrodynamics, a weak field multipole
expansion, a tidal analysis, or a rigidly corotating velocity field. The
implication of these results for gravity wave detectors is also discussed.

not mix with the gluon distributions, and thus our result is the same for the
flavor-singlet and nonsinglet distributions. At small $n$ (moment of $h_1$),
$\gamma^{h(1)}_n$ is significantly larger than $\gamma^{f,g(1)}_n$ (the
anomalous dimension for the nonsinglet $f_1$ and $g_1$), but approaches
$\gamma^{f,g(1)}_n$ very quickly at large $n$, keeping the relation
$\gamma^{h(1)}_n > \gamma^{f,g(1)}_n$. This feature is in parallel to the
relation between the one-loop anomalous dimension for $f_1$ $(g_1)$ and $h_1$.
We also show that this difference in the anomalous dimension between $h_1$ and

quark-gluon plasma. The third equation of state has been extracted from the
microscopic transport code RQMD under the assumption of complete local
thermalization. All three equations of state provide reasonable fits to data
taken by the NA44 and NA49 Collaborations. The initial conditions before the
evolution of the fireballs and the space-time evolution pictures differ
dramatically for the three equations of state when the same freeze-out

determined by the effective softness of the equation of state during the
