a single thermal Raymond-Smith model (kT = 0.44) or a hybrid model consisting
of 80% power-law with the canonical photon index -1.9 plus 20% Raymond-Smith
contribution (kT = 0.63) lead to good fits. However, the single thermal model
turns out to be unlikely because it yields a luminosity of 3.8 10^{43} erg/s,
which is hard to reach in a starburst superwind-scenario. The hybrid model
leads to a more moderate luminosity of 5.2 10^{42} erg/s, of which 1.0 10^{42}
erg/s can be attributed to shocked superwind gas. We link the remaining 4.2
10^{42} erg/s powerlaw to an AGN component because the alternative of
inverse-compton scattering of the FIR radiation leads to a too low flux when
estimated with available data. The result appears to be consistent with
preliminarily announced ASCA observations. For NGC 2782 we find L_x = 4 10^{41}
erg/s which can be explained by emission from a shocked superwind region with a
high preshock density in agreement with earlier optical evidence for an

  Microlensing Events Toward the LMC","14 pages, Latex + 4 PS figures, Submitted to ApJ (Letters)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Short version: Zaritsky and Lin (1997, ZL97) have recently presented
observations which can be interpreted as evidence for an intervening stellar
population along the line-of-sight to the LMC, at a distance of ~34 kpc. They
suggest that it may belong to a low surface-brightness dwarf galaxy, or to the
tidal debris of a disrupted galaxy, and derive an optical depth for
gravitational lensing through the intervening system which is consistent with
the observed value. Such interpretation of the microlensing events toward the
LMC has major implications for the nature of the dark matter, and thus should
be tested in every conceivable way.
  We suggest a method utilizing the microlensing data themselves to
discriminate between the various hypotheses. We find that the first eight MACHO
events toward the LMC are as consistent with a standard halo distribution of
0.5 solar-mass MACHOs (best fit), as they are with an intervening population
having a transverse speed of ~240 km/s and a Miller-Scalo stellar IMF. Monte
Carlo simulations show that in order to completely rule out either hypothesis,
about 40 events will be required if the IMF is rising below the H-burning mass
limit, and about 140 if it is falling. If the ZL97 intervening population
hypothesis is correct then: (a) the currently observed range of event durations
directly implies a lens mass range of ~0.06-0.8 solar-mass, which brackets the
mass of ~0.2 solar mass where many investigations claim that the stellar IMF
peaks, and (b) the event distribution provides valuable information on the
low-mass end of the stellar IMF.

resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and

5846, the dominant galaxy of a small group of galaxies. A dust lane with a dust
mass of 7 10^3 Msun is detected in the central few kpc of NGC 5846. The
morphology of the dust features are strikingly similar to that observed for the
optical nebulosity AND the X-ray emission. A physical connection between the
different phases of the interstellar medium therefore seems likely.
  We discuss three different options for the origin of the dusty nebular
filaments: Condensation out of a cooling flow, mass loss of late-type stars
within NGC 5846, and material donated by a small neighbouring galaxy. We
conclude that the dust as well as the optical nebulosity are most likely
products of a recent interaction with a small, relatively gas-rich galaxy,
probably of Magellanic type.
  Dust grains in the dust lane are destroyed by sputtering in the hot,
X-ray-emitting gas in less than about 10^7 yr, which is shorter than the
crossing time of a (small) galaxy through the central 5 kpc of NGC 5846. We
argue that the dust is replenished by evaporation of cool, dense gas cloudlets
that were brought in during the interaction. The evaporation rate of cool gas
in NGC 5846, 0.001 solar mass per year, is consistent with the ""mass deposition
rate"" derived from X-ray measurements.
  The energy lost by the hot gas through heating of dust and evaporation of
cool gas clouds in the central few kpc of NGC 5846 is adequately balanced by
heat sources: transport of heat by electron conduction and loss of kinetic
energy of the in-falling galaxy. There does not seem to be a need to invoke the
presence of a ""cooling flow"" to explain the X-ray and optical data.

surprisingly small orbits, which may indicate that considerable orbital

orbital migration is for a series of planets to be accreted, destroyed, and

study the ramifications of planet accretion for the final main sequence
metallicity of the star. If maximum disk lifetimes are on the order of 10 Myr,
stars with masses near 1 solar mass are predicted to have virtually no
metallicity enhancement. On the other hand, early F and late A type stars with
masses of 1.5--2.0 solar masses can experience significant metallicity
enhancements due to their considerably smaller convection zones during the

assumed to be immobile and randomly distributed in space. For CARs we develop a
kinetic formalism, based on Collins-Kimball-type ideas; within this formalism
we obtain explicit expressions for the effective reaction rates and for the
decay of the reactants' concentrations.

fluctuate in granular media. The first one is a scalar model where only the
vertical component of the stress tensor is considered. In the continuum limit,
this model is equivalent to a diffusion equation (where the r\^ole of time is
played by the vertical coordinate) plus a randomly varying convection term. We
calculate the response and correlation function of this model, and discuss
several properties, in particular related to the stress distribution function.
We then turn to the tensorial model, where the basic starting point is a wave
equation which, in the absence of disorder, leads to a ray-like propagation of
stress. In the presence of disorder, the rays acquire a diffusive width and the
angle of propagation is shifted. A striking feature is that the response
function becomes negative, which suggests that the contact network is
mechanically unstable to very weak perturbations. The stress correlation
function reveals characteristic features related to the ray-like propagation,
which are absent in the scalar description. Our analytical calculations are
confirmed and extended by a numerical analysis of the stochastic wave equation.

quantum inequality for a static observer in terms of a Euclidean two-point
function. In a short sampling time limit, the quantum inequality can be written
as the flat space form plus subdominant correction terms dependent upon the
geometric properties of the spacetime. This supports the use of flat space
quantum inequalities to constrain negative energy effects in curved spacetime.
Using the exact Euclidean two-point function method, we develop the quantum
inequalities for perfectly reflecting planar mirrors in flat spacetime. We then
look at the quantum inequalities in static de~Sitter spacetime, Rindler
spacetime and two- and four-dimensional black holes. In the case of a
four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, explicit forms of the inequality are
found for static observers near the horizon and at large distances. It is show
that there is a quantum averaged weak energy condition (QAWEC), which states
that the energy density averaged over the entire worldline of a static observer
is bounded below by the vacuum energy of the spacetime. In particular, for an
observer at a fixed radial distance away from a black hole, the QAWEC says that
the averaged energy density can never be less than the Boulware vacuum energy
density.

effects have been so far computed by treating gravity at the Background Field
Approximation. The principle aim of this paper is to investigate the validity
of this approximation which is not specific to gravity. To this end, for
reasons of simplicity and clarity, we shall compare the descriptions of thermal
processes induced by constant acceleration (i.e. the Unruh effect) in four
dynamical frameworks. In this problem, the position of the ``heavy''
accelerated system plays the role of gravity. In the first framework, the
trajectory is treated at the BFA: it is given from the outset and unaffected by
radiative processes. In the second one, recoil effects induced by these
emission processes are taken into account by describing the system's position
by WKB wave functions. In the third one, the accelerated system is described by
second quantized fields and in the fourth one, gravity is turned on. It is most
interesting to see when and why transitions amplitudes evaluated in different
frameworks but describing the same process do agree. It is indeed this
comparison that determines the validity of the BFA. It is also interesting to
notice that the abandonment of the BFA delivers new physical insights
concerning the processes. For instance, in the fourth framework, the
``recoils'' of gravity show that the acceleration horizon area acts as an
entropy in delivering heat to accelerated systems.

states of the nucleon is explored using a simple model of the nucleon-nucleon

manifestly covariant, analytically solvable, and gauge invariant. The
consequences of this model are studied in the simplest possible framework. We
assume that all particles have spin zero and that the tower has only three
charged members, which consist of the proton, the Roper, and a higher state in
the vicinity of the $D_{13}$. Nucleon-nucleon S-wave phase shifts and the
deuteron form factor are calculated using this three member tower, and the

which allows the dispersion relation for a given radius to be calculated
self-consistently along with the meson fields; in previous work some ansatz for
the dispersion relation has always been an input. Results in all models are
very sensitive to the form of the dispersion relation, so our approach
represents a significant advance. We apply the method to both the Friedberg Lee
model and the chiral quark-meson model of Birse and Banerjee. Only the latter
shows short range repulsion; in the former the transition to a quark plasma
occurs at unrealistically low densities.

equations for which uniqueness fails maximally, at least in some limit. The
inviscid Burgers equation, in the context of Onsager's suggestion that
turbulence should be described by a negative absolute temperature, is such a
limit. In this picture, the onset of turbulence coincides with the
proliferation of singularities which characterizes the failure of uniqueness.

exchange terms included in the Hamiltonians systems have non-symmetric
eigenfunctions, which are products of the ground state with members of a family
of orthogonal polynomials. These polynomials can be defined and studied by
using the differential-difference operators introduced by the author in TAMS
1989 (311), 167-183. There is a study of polynomials which are invariant or
alternating for parabolic subgroups of the symmetric group. The detailed
analysis depends on using two bases of polynomials, one of which transforms
monomially under group actions and the other one is orthogonal. There are
formulas for norms and point-evaluations which are simplifications of those of
Sahi. For any parabolic subgroup of the symmetric group there is a skew
operator on polynomials which leads to evaluation at (1,1,...,1) of the
quotient of the unique skew polynomial in a given irreducible subspace by the
minimum alternating polynomial, analogously to a Weyl character formula. The
last section concerns orthogonal polynomials for the type B Weyl group with an
emphasis on the Hermite-type polynomials. A complete basis of eigenfunctions of
Yamamoto's B_N spin Calogero model is obtained by multiplying these polynomials
by the ground state.

code consisting of the entire Hilbert space is the only additive code that is
equivalent to any code containing the given code), and provide a construction
for an ((11,2,3)) strongly nonadditive code.
