variety $X$, i.e. line bundles with global sections having arbitrarily
prescribed $k$-jets at a finite number of points. We introduce the notion of an
associated $k$-convex $\D$-support function, $\psi_L$, requiring that the
polyhedra $P_L$ has edges of length at least $k$. This translates to the
property that the intersection of $L$ with the invariant curves, associated to
every edge, is $\geq k$. We also state an equivalent criterion in terms of a
bound of the Seshadri constant $\e(L,x)$. More precisely we prove the
equivalence of the following: (1) $L$ is $k$-jet ample; (2) $L\cdot C\geq k$,
for any invariant curve $C$; (3) $\psi_L$ is $k$-convex; (4) the Seshadri
constant $\e(L,x)\geq k$ for each $x\in X$.

  replaced, affecting some of the conclusions",,"10.1086/306300",,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged version): The optical depth is widely used in Galactic microlensing
studies as a means to determine the density of MACHOs, since in theory it
depends only upon their spatial distribution and is therefore less
model-dependent than other microlensing observables. However, since the
measured optical depth is restricted to that of events with measurable
timescales, inferences of total MACHO density are dependent on the assumed
timescale distribution. Using the 2-year LMC results of the MACHO
collaboration, we illustrate this point by showing how, for an assumed
isothermal halo, the inferred MACHO halo fraction as determined from optical
depth estimates depends upon MACHO mass.
  The analysis highlights the following conclusions: (1) The MACHO density
inferred from optical depth measurements depends on the assumed MACHO mass
function for a given Galactic distribution function; (2) without extra
information on the MACHO mass function, such as can be obtained from the
rate-timescale distribution, optical depth measurements can provide a lower
limit but not an upper limit on the MACHO density for a given Galactic
distribution function; (3) a comparison between the inferred total optical
depth of different Galactic models, or of different components in a
multi-component Galactic model, requires knowledge of the underlying timescale
distribution for each model or component.

  A direct consequence of nonstandard diffusion is that the equilibrium energy
distribution of particles departs from the Maxwellian one (tails goes to zero
more slowly or faster than exponentially) modifying the reaction rates.
  This effect is qualitatively different from temperature and/or composition
modification: Small changes in the number of particles in the distribution
tails can strongly modify the rates without affecting bulk properties, such as
the sound speed or hydrostatic equilibrium, which depend on the mean values

comparing it to the exact KKR determinant, which we generalize here for the A_1
subspace. With the help of the Ewald resummation method developed for the full
KKR determinant we transfer the complex diffractive determinant to a real form.
The real zeros of the determinant are the quantum eigenvalues in semiclassical
approximation. The essential parameter is the strength of the scatterer
c=J_0(kR)/Y_0(kR). Surprisingly, this can take any value between plus and minus
infinity within the range of validity of the diffractive approximation kR <<4.
We study the statistics exhibited by spectra for fixed values of c. It is
Poissonian for |c|=infinity, provided the disk is placed inside a rectangle
whose sides obeys some constraints. For c=0 we find a good agreement of the
level spacing distribution with GOE, whereas the form factor and two-point
correlation function are similar but exhibit larger deviations. By varying the
parameter c from 0 to infinity the level statistics interpolates smoothly

large Fermi surface despite the absence of well-defined quasiparticles and the
necessity of working at finite temperatures. However, the even more unusual
behavior in the underdoped high temperature superconductors, which show a

present the first results on how the Fermi surface is destroyed as a function
of temperature in underdoped Bi2212 using ARPES. We find the remarkable effect
that different k points become gapped at different temperatures. This leads to
a break up of the Fermi surface at a temperature T* into disconnected Fermi
arcs which shrink with decreasing T, eventually collapsing to the point nodes
of the dx2-y2 superconducting ground state below Tc. This novel behavior, where
the Fermi surface does not form a continuous contour in momentum space, is
unprecedented in that it occurs in the absence of long range order. Moreover,
although the d-wave superconducting gap below Tc smoothly evolves into the
pseudogap above Tc, the gaps at different k points are not related to one
another above Tc the same way as they are below, implying an intimate, but
non-trivial relation, between the two.

state which characterizes the 2-leg spin ladder Kondo insulator cannot fight
against very weak exterior perturbations. First, by using standard bosonization
techniques, we prove that an antiferromagnetic ground state occurs by doping
with few holes; it is characterized by a form factor of the spin-spin
correlation functions which exhibits two structures respectively at $q=\pi$ and
$q=2k_F$. Second, we prove precisely by using renormalization group methods
that the Anderson-localization inevitably takes place in that weak-coupling
Haldane system, by the introduction of quenched randomness; the spin-fixed
point rather corresponds to a ``glass'' state. Finally, a weak-coupling
``analogue'' of the S=1 antiferromagnet Kondo insulator is proposed; we show
that the transition into the Anderson-localization state may be avoided in that
unusual weak-coupling Haldane system.

  Here I approach quantum gravity (QG) in the view of constructive, algebraic
quantum field theory (QFT). Comparing QG with usual QFT, the algebraic approach
clarifies analogies and peculiarities. As usual, an isotonic net of *-algebras
is taken to encode the quantum field operators. For QG, the kinematical
covariance group acts via diffeomorphisms on the open sets of the manifold, and
via algebraic isomorphisms on the algebras. In general, the algebra of
observables is covariant only under a (dynamical) subgroup of the general
diffeomorphism group.
  After an algebraic implementation of the dynamical subgroup of dilations,
small and large scale cutoffs may be introduced algebraically. So the usual a
priori conflict of cutoffs with general covariance is avoided. Even more, these
cutoffs provide a natural local cobordism for topological quantum field theory.
  A new commutant duality between the minimal and maximal algebra allows to
extract the modular structure from the net of algebras. The outer modular
isomorphisms are then again related to dilations, which (under certain
conditions) may provide a notion of time.

primary functions of high energy colliders. We point out that most Higgs boson
searches pursued at hadron colliders require Yukawa interactions either in the
production or the decay of a Higgs boson. We propose a trilepton Higgs boson
search based only upon the gauge interactions of the Higgs. This strategy can
be utilized successfully for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson as well as
non-standard Higgs bosons which break electroweak symmetry but have little to
do with fermion mass generation. The trileptons come from Wh production
followed by Wh -> WWW^(*) -> 3l decays. A SM Higgs trilepton signal would be
difficult to detect at the Tevatron collider: with 100 fb^{-1} of data, only a
$3\sigma$ signal above background can be achieved after cuts if 140 GeV < mh <
175 GeV. Some discrimination of signal over background can be gained by
analyzing the opposite sign dilepton pT distributions. At the LHC with 30 (100)
fb^{-1} a clear discovery above the $5\sigma$ level is possible for a Higgs
mass in the range 140-185 (125-200) GeV. Prospects for a trilepton Higgs
discovery are greatly improved for models with non-standard Higgs sectors where
a Higgs boson couples preferentially to vector bosons rather than to fermions.

the mantle and crust could provide a direct measurement of the total abundance
of uranium and thorium in the Earth. In calculating the antineutrino flux at
specific sites, the local geology of the crust and the background from the
world's nuclear power reactors are important considerations. Employing a global
crustal map, with type and thickness data, and using recent estimates of the
uranium and thorium distribution in the Earth, we calculate the antineutrino
event rate for two new neutrino detectors. We show that spectral features allow
terrestrial antineutrino events to be identified above reactor antineutrino
backgrounds and that the uranium and thorium contributions can be separately
determined.

three-momentum components of both final state protons were measured and the
missing energy and momentum of the target proton in the nucleus were
determined.
  The validity of the quasi-elastic picture was verified up to Fermi momenta of
about 450 MeV/c, where it might be questionable. Transverse and longitudinal
Fermi momentum distributions of the target proton were measured and compared to
independent particle models which do not reproduce the large momentum tails. We
also observed that the transverse Fermi distribution gets wider as the
longitudinal component increases in the beam direction, in contrast to a simple
Fermi gas model.

levels are obtained for both weak and strong pairing force. This improves on
results of the conventional Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

into descriptions of hadronic processes based on four-dimensional scattering
integral equations. The method involves the idea of gauging the scattering
equations themselves, and results in electromagnetic amplitudes where an
external photon is effectively coupled to every part of every strong
interaction diagram in the model. Current conservation is therefore implemented
in the theoretically correct fashion. To illustrate our gauging procedure we
apply it to the three-nucleon problem whose strong interactions are described
by standard three-body integral equations. In this way we obtain the
expressions needed to calculate all possible electromagnetic processes of the
three-nucleon system: the electromagnetic form factors of the three-body bound
state, pd->pd gamma, gamma 3He-> pd, gamma 3He-> ppn, etc. As the photon is
coupled everywhere in the strong interaction model, a unified description of
the NNN-gamma NNN system is obtained. An interesting aspect of our results is
the natural appearance of a subtraction term needed to avoid the overcounting
of diagrams.

discussed in the framework of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. The
symmetries of the Lagrangian produce three commuting conserved quantities that
are found to be recursively related to one-another for a certain specific value
of the power of nonlinearity. The above cited recursion relations are obeyed
with a second Poisson bracket which sheds light on the integrability properties
of the above nonlinear equation. It is shown that a Miura-type transformation
can be made to obtain the fifth order $mKdV$-type equation from the fifth order
$KdV$-type equation. The spatial dependence of the fields involved is, however,
not physically interesting from the point of view of the solitonic solutions.
As a consequence, it seems that the fifth order $KdV$- and $mKdV$-type
equations are completely independent nonlinear evolution equations in their own
right.
