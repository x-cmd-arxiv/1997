explained through the initial cosmological conditions. The sigma8=1 SCDM model
produces galaxies with high velocities when compared to observations, but when
the SCDM power spectrum is normalized to sigma8=0.57 an excellent agreement

natural extension to galactic scales of the observed galaxy distribution power

nearby supernova by using a numerical supernova model and realistic Monte-Carlo
simulations of detection by the Super-Kamiokande detector. We mainly discuss
the detectability of the signatures of the delayed explosion mechanism in the
time evolution of the $\anue$ luminosity and spectrum. For a supernova at 10
kpc away from the Earth, we find that not only the signature is clearly
discernible, but also the deviation of energy spectrum from the Fermi-Dirac
(FD) distribution can be observed. The deviation from the FD distribution
would, if observed, provide a test for the standard picture of neutrino
emission from collapse-driven supernovae. For the $D$ = 50 kpc case, the
signature of the delayed explosion is still observable, but statistical
fluctuation is too large to detect the deviation from the FD distribution. We
also propose a method for statistical reconstruction of the time evolution of
$\anue$ luminosity and spectrum from data, by which we can get a smoother time
evolution and smaller statistical errors than a simple, time-binning analysis.
This method is useful especially when the available number of events is
relatively small, e.g., a supernova in the LMC or SMC. Neutronization burst of
$\nu_e$'s produces about 5 scattering events when $D$ = 10 kpc and this signal
is difficult to distinguish from $\anue p$ events.

continues until the entire clump has been photo-ionized. We present an analytic

formation of dark-matter halos follows the Press-Schechter theory, (2) the
ratio of central black hole mass to halo mass is the same for all halos, and
(3) the light-curve of quasars, in Eddington units, is universal. We show that
a universal light-curve provides an excellent fit to the observed quasar
luminosity function at redshifts 2.6 < z < 4.5. By extrapolating the evolution
of this luminosity function to higher redshifts (4.5 < z < 20), we find that
the associated early population of low-luminosity quasars reionizes the
universe around redshift z=12. The reprocessing of the UV light of these
quasars by dust from early type II supernovae, distorts the microwave
background spectrum by a Compton y-parameter, y = 1e-5, comparable to the upper

Crab is the brightest continuum source in the 1-10 MeV gamma-ray sky, and its
continuum radiation is most likely of synchrotron origin. It is a likely source
of cosmic rays through shock acceleration and thus a potential candidate for
gamma-ray line emission from nuclear interactions. Five years of COMPTEL
observations enable a fine spectral binning to investigate the behaviour of the
0.75-30 MeV emission in detail and to search for nuclear de-excitation lines on
top of the continuum. The nebular spectrum shows a break at the edge of the
COMPTEL energy range and connects well to the EGRET spectrum, probably
reflecting electron energy losses in the synchrotron emission scenario. Such a
smooth continuum model alone may not be sufficient to explain the observations.
A weak bump in the spectrum at 1-2 MeV may be present. No significant evidence
for distinct line emission is seen, but the presence of a blend of line
features or another synchrotron component cannot be excluded.

derived in spherically symmetric general relativity. This equation expresses
the gradient of the active gravitational energy E according to the Einstein
equation, divided into energy-supply and work terms. Projecting the equation
along the flow of thermodynamic matter and along the trapping horizon of a
blackhole yield, respectively, first laws of relativistic thermodynamics and
black-hole dynamics. In the black-hole case, this first law has the same form
as the first law of black-hole statics, with static perturbations replaced by
the derivative along the horizon. There is the expected term involving the area
and surface gravity, where the dynamic surface gravity is defined as in the
static case but using the Kodama vector and trapping horizon. This surface
gravity vanishes for degenerate trapping horizons and satisfies certain
expected inequalities involving the area and energy. In the thermodynamic case,
the quasi-local first law has the same form, apart from a relativistic factor,
as the classical first law of thermodynamics, involving heat supply and
hydrodynamic work, but with E replacing the internal energy. Expanding E in the
Newtonian limit shows that it incorporates the Newtonian mass, kinetic energy,
gravitational potential energy and thermal energy. There is also a weak type of
unified zeroth law: a Gibbs-like definition of thermal equilibrium requires
constancy of an effective temperature, generalising the Tolman condition and
the particular case of Hawking radiation, while gravithermal equilibrium

density. Anti-GUT) At high energy, above an essential desert of only Standard
Model interactions, there is the bigger gauge group $SMG^3\times U(1)_f$ which
means that each family of quarks and leptons has its own set of gauge bosons
analogous to those in the Standard Model itself, and then there is one extra
abelian gauge boson called $U(1)_f$. In addition we make some further more
phenomenological assumptions. We succeed in fitting order of magnitudewise most
of the (effective) Yukawa couplings observed in the Standard Model as quark and
lepton masses and mixing angles. We have more accurate numbers for the three
fine-structure constants and the top and Higgs masses, as well as some
suggestive understanding of the fine-tuning wonders for the cosmological
constant and the $\Theta$-angles. CP-violation is predicted a bit low, but
order of magnitudewise in agreement with experiment. In summary, we obtain at
least an order of magnitudewise understanding of the Standard Model parameters

our somewhat more discrete choices.

trajectories in (N|M)-dimensional superspace, the extra dimension being the
parameter along the trajectory. The restrictions to various subalgebras are
considered. In particular, the centrally extended superconformal algebra is
obtained by restriction to the contact superalgebra K(1|1). This shows that one
of the basic assumptions in superstring theory (the distinguished nature of the
superconformal algebra) is incorrect.

Analytical and numerical results show that the probability to find a large
event at time $t$ after an initial major event decreases as $t^{-\tau}$ for
small $t$, with the exponent $\tau$ ranging from 0 to values well above 1. This
is in contrast to Sneppen und Newman, who stated that the exponent is about 1,
independent of the microscopic details of the simulation. Numerical simulations
of an extended model [C. Wilke, T. Martinetz, Phys. Rev. E56, 7128 (1997)] show
that the power-law is only a generic feature of the original dynamics and does
not necessarily appear in a more general context. Finally, the implications of
the results to the modeling of earthquakes are discussed.

we assume that the stochastic processes involved are white noise processes,
which enables us to give a simple master equation description of this source of
decoherence. This master equation is averaged over the noise, and is sufficient
to describe the results of experiments that probe the oscillations in the
electronic populations as energy is exchanged between the internal and
electronic motion. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with recent
experiments and predict that the decoherence rate will depend on vibrational
quantum number in different ways depending on which vibrational excitation

extended to the study of the far-field behaviour of short-waves, commonly
called ripples. It is proved that the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony- Peregrine equation
can propagates short-waves. This result contradict the Benjamin hypothesis that
short-waves tends not to propagate in this model and close a part of the old
controversy between Korteweg-de Vries and Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Peregrine
equations. We shown that a nonlinear (quadratic) Klein-Gordon type equation
substitutes in a short-wave analysis the ubiquitous Korteweg-de Vries equation
of long-wave approach. Moreover the kink solutions of phi-4 and sine-Gordon
equations are understood as an all orders asymptotic behaviour of short-waves.
It is proved that the antikink solution of phi-4 model which was never obtained
perturbatively can be obtained by perturbation expansion in the wave-number k
in the short-wave limit.
