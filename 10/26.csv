  to question 6 in the original version of the paper had been already proven by
  Zak",,,,"alg-geom dg-ga math.AG math.DG",,"  Let $X\subset P^N$ be a variety (respectively a patch of an analytic
submanifold) and let $x\in X$ be a general point. We show that if the
projective second fundamental form of $X$ at $x$ is isomorphic to the second
fundamental form of a point of a Segre $P^n\times P^m$, $n,m\geq 2$, a
Grassmaniann $G(2,n+2)$, $n\geq 4$, or the Cayley plane $OP^2$, then $X$ is the
corresponding homogeneous variety (resp. a patch of the corresponding
homogeneous variety). If the projective second fundamental form of $X$ at $x$
is isomorphic to the second fundamental form of a point of a Veronese
$v_2(P^n)$ and the Fubini cubic form of $X$ at $x$ is zero, then $X=v_2(P^n)$
(resp. a patch of $v_2(P^n)$). All these results are valid in the real or
complex analytic categories and locally in the $C^{\infty}$ category if one
assumes the hypotheses hold in a neighborhood of any point $x$. As a byproduct,
we show that the systems of quadrics $I_2(P^{m-1}\sqcup P^{n-1}), I_2(P^1\times
P^{n-1})$ and $I_2(S_5)$ are stable in the sense that if $A_t\subset S^2T^*$ is
an analytic family such that for $t\neq 0$, $A_t\simeq A$, then $A_0\simeq A$.
  We also make some observations related to the Fulton-Hansen connectedness
theorem.

transport problems are discussed. We describe one-dimensional electrons
tunneling through a point-like defect either by the s-d exchange (Kondo)
mechanism, or via the resonanse level (Anderson) mechanism. These models are
potential candidates to be solved exactly in the presence of arbitrary external
bias. We draw attention also to several mesoscopical systems which can be
tackled by the massless form-factor approach, as perturbations of integrable
models. The basic unperturbed model is the massless sine-Gordon model with the
interaction (cosine) term restricted to one point, which is integrable. It is
being perturbed by the second interaction term, which destroys integrability.
Quasi-exact results can be obtained by making use of the basis of massless
quasiparticles of the sine-Gordon model.

the early section the metric is almost Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m, and the fields
behave according to perturbation analysis. We find exact analytical expressions
for the gradients of $r$ and of the scalar field, which are valid at both

breaking of the electro-weak symmetry are analyzed. In the case of minimal
supergravity it is found that for low tan\beta and for low values of fine
tuning Phi, where Phi is defined essentially by the ratio \mu^2/M_Z^2 where \mu
is the Higgs mixing parameter and M_Z is the Z boson mass, the allowed values
of the universal scalar parameter m_0, and the universal gaugino mass m_{1/2}
lie on the surface of an ellipsoid with radii fixed by \Phi leading to tightly
constrained upper bounds \sim \sqrt\Phi.Thus for tan\beta\leq 2(\leq 5) it is
found that the upper limits for the entire set of sparticle masses lie in the
range < 700 GeV (<1.5TeV) for any reasonable range of fine tuning (\Phi\leq
20). However, it is found that there exist regions of the parameter space where
the fine tuning does not tightly constrain m_0 and m_{1/2}. Effects of non-
universalities in the Higgs sector and in the third generation sector on
naturalness bounds are also analyzed and it is found that non-universalities
can significantly affect the upper bounds. It is also found that achieving the
maximum Higgs mass allowed in supergravity unified models requires a high
degree of fine tuning. Thus a heavy sparticle spectrum is indicated if the
Higgs mass exceeds 120 GeV. The prospect for the discovery of supersymmetry at
the Tevatron and at the LHC in view of these results is discussed.

equations. We find new one-parameter family of reflection matrices for the RSOS
model in addition to the previous result without any parameter. We also find
three classes of reflection matrices for the SOS model, which has one or two
parameters. For the hard hexagon model which can be mapped to RSOS(5) model by
folding four RSOS heights into two, the solutions can be obtained similarly
with a main difference in the boundary unitarity conditions. Due to this, the
reflection matrices can have two free parameters. We show that these extra
terms can be identified with the `decorated' solutions. We also generalize the
hard hexagon model by `folding' the RSOS heights of the general RSOS(p) model
and show that they satisfy the integrability conditions such as the Yang-
Baxter and boundary Yang-Baxter equations. These models can be solved using the
results for the RSOS models.
