reveals its presence by the gravitational lensing of quasars, and outnumbers
normal galaxies by around 3:1. There are 8 double quasars with a separation
greater than 2 arcseconds which have been classified as probable or certain
gravitational lenses. Lensing galaxies have only been found for 2 of these
systems, and analysis of the remainder has led in each case to the conclusion
that they are best explained by the gravitational lensing effect of a `dark
galaxy'. Here we examine the ensemble properties of this sample and conclude
that there is overwhelming evidence that the systems are indeed being
gravitationally lensed by dark galaxies or perhaps dark matter galactic halos.
The existence and nature of such objects raises some intriguing questions, as
well as having profound implications for large scale structure. Several of the
quasar systems show strong evidence for microlensing. It is argued that this
implies a substantial component of dark matter in the form of compact bodies,
either in the halo of the lensing galaxy or more generally along the line of
sight.

distance determination, convey important information on the physics of the
emission mechanism, and perhaps also about the underlying energy source. As the
gamma-ray phenomenon is extremely diverse, with time scales spanning several
orders of magnitude, some diversity in optical counterpart signatures appears
plausible. We have studied the Optical Transient, which accompanied the
gamma-ray burst of May 8, 1997 (GRB 970508). Observations conducted at the
2.5-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and the 2.2-m telescope at the
German-Spanish Calar Alto observatory (CAHA) cover the time interval starting 3
hours 5 minutes to 96 days after the high energy event. This brackets all other
published observations, including radio. When analyzed in conjunction with
optical data from other observatories, evidence emerges for a composite light
curve. The first interval, from 3 to 8 hours after the event was characterized
by a constant, or slowly declining brightness. At a later moment the brightness
started increasing rapidly, and reached a maximum approximately 40 hours after
the GRB. From that moment the GRB brightness decayed approximately as a
power-law of index -1.21. The last observation, after 96 days, m_R =
24.28+-0.10, is brighter than the extrapolated power-law, and hints that a
constant component, m_R = 25.50+-0.40 is present. The OT is unresolved (FWHM
0.83"") at the faintest magnitude level. The brightness of the optical
transient, its duration and the general shape of the light curve sets this
source apart from the single other optical transient known, that of the
February 28, 1997 event.

(1150-3200 Ang) spectra of seven such UV-bright LINERs. Data for three of the
galaxies (NGC 404, NGC 4569, and NGC 5055) are presented for the first time,

absorption-line signatures of massive stars, indicating a stellar origin for
the UV continuum. Similar features are probably present in NGC 6500. The same
stellar signatures may be present but undetectable in NGC 4594, due to the low
signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, and in M81 and NGC 4579, due to
superposed strong, broad emission lines. The compact central UV continuum
source that is observed in these galaxies is a nuclear star cluster rather than
a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), at least in some cases. Except
for the two LINERs with broad emission lines (M81 and NGC 4579), the LINERs
have weak or no detectable UV emission lines. At least four of the LINERs
suffer from an ionizing photon deficit, in the sense that the ionizing photon
flux inferred from the observed far-UV continuum is insufficient to drive the
optical H I recombination lines. Examination of the nuclear X-ray flux of each
galaxy shows a high X-ray/UV ratio in the four ``UV-photon starved'' LINERs.
Future observations can determine whether the UV continuum in LINERs is always
dominated by a starburst or, alternatively, that there are two types of
UV-bright LINERs: starburst-dominated and AGN-dominated.

galaxy clusters. Two ensembles of 18 realizations, spanning a decade in
temperature, are evolved with and without winds in an underlying biased CDM
cosmology. Galaxies are identified as peaks in the initial density field, and
are assumed to lose half their initial mass over a Hubble time in winds with an
effective temperature of 8 keV. The energy input through winds boosts the
entropy of the ICM above that generated by infall, resulting in a more extended
density profile. The magnitude of this effect increases with decreasing mass or
temperature, consistent with observations. The extended nature of the ICM with
winds can lead to underestimates of the global baryon fraction, with
low-temperature clusters particularly deficient. We calibrate the amplitude of
this effect at density contrasts of 170 and 500. On the other hand, the final
temperature of the gas is relatively unaffected; a similar mass-temperature
relation exists with or without winds. The input wind energy is effectively
consumed as work to lift the gas in the dark matter dominated potential. While
the dark matter profile exhibits a self-similar form seen in other studies, the
galaxy distribution is more centrally concentrated than either the dark matter
or gas, and evidences a mild velocity bias. The gradient of galaxies with
respect to primordial gas produces strong, negative radial gradients in
metallicity within the ICM.

inclination, and we conclude that dust obscuration is the dominant factor
determining whether or not a UV source is detected. Large emission-line
equivalent widths and the presence of broad-line emission also increase the
likelihood of detection of nuclear UV emission. Our results suggest that the
majority of LINERs harbor obscured nuclear UV sources, which may be either
accretion-powered active nuclei or young star clusters. Under the assumption
that the compact UV sources in NGC 3642 and NGC 4203 have nonstellar power-law
spectra extending into the extreme ultraviolet, the extrapolated ionizing
fluxes are sufficiently strong to photoionize the narrow-line regions of these

strong dust lanes which may be responsible for obscuring some UV sources.

have constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map can
be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The result of these
manipulations is a map with DIRBE-quality calibration and IRAS resolution.
  To generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light
contamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is
done via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden-
Dwingeloo map of H_I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a
suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no
significant CIB is detected. In the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where the
zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux
levels of 32 \pm 13 nW/m^2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 \pm 4 nW/m^2/sr at 240
micron (95% confidence). This integrated flux is ~2 times that extrapolated
from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field.
  The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic
extinction. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older
Burstein-Heiles estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. These dust
maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates

structure formation, which is the most likely scenario for cosmological models
with lots of power at small scales (e.g. standard cold dark matter). Models
with little small scale power lead to scenarios closer to spherical collapse.
Recently favored power spectra (e.g. CDM+Lambda) lie somewhere in between
suggesting that both types of processes are important and may vary over time
due to gaseous reheating. From this viewpoint this paper explores a very simple
inside out scenario for galaxy formation. This scenario is a natural result of
synthesizing earlier work on DM halos, spherical collapse, and gas
redistribution via angular momentum. Although, this model is highly simplified
and is not designed to accurately describe the detailed formation of any
individual galaxy, it does (by design) predict the overall features of
galaxies. In addition, old bulges and young disks are an almost unavoidable
result of these very simple models. This scenario may provide a useful
framework for both observers and theoreticians to think about galaxy formation.

activity at TeV energies, as monitored with the Whipple, HEGRA and CAT
Cherenkov telescopes. Over the whole 0.1-200 keV range the spectrum was
exceptionally hard (alpha =< 1, with F_nu ~ nu^{-alpha}) indicating that the
X-ray power output peaked at (or above) ~100 keV. This represents a shift of at
least two orders of magnitude with respect to previous observations of Mkn 501,
a behavior never seen before in this or any other blazar. The overall X-ray
spectrum hardens with increasing intensity and, at each epoch, it is softer at
larger energies. The correlated variability from soft X-rays to the TeV band
points to models in which the same population of relativistic electrons
produces the X-ray continuum via synchrotron radiation and the TeV emission by
inverse Compton scattering of the synchrotron photons or other seed photons.
For the first time in any blazar the synchrotron power is observed to peak at
hard X-ray energies. The large shift of the synchrotron peak frequency with
respect to previous observations of Mkn 501 implies that intrinsic changes in
the relativistic electron spectrum caused the increase in emitted power. Due to
the very high electron energies, the inverse Compton process is limited by the
Klein-Nishina regime. This implies a quasi-linear (as opposed to quadratic)
relation of the variability amplitude in the TeV and hard X-ray ranges (for the
SSC model) and an increase of the inverse Compton peak frequency smaller than
that of the synchrotron peak frequency.

spherical region leads to the correct relativistic expression (the Friedmann
equation) for the evolution of the cosmic scale factor. Here, the cosmological
implications of Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) are considered by
means of a similar procedure. Earlier work by Felten demonstrated that in a
region dominated by modified dynamics, the expansion cannot be uniform
(separations cannot be expressed in terms of a scale factor) and that any such
region will eventually re-collapse regardless of the initial expansion velocity
and mean density. Here I show that, because of the acceleration threshold for
the MOND phenomenology, a region dominated by MOND will have a finite size
which, in the early Universe ($z > 3$), is smaller than the horizon scale.
Therefore, uniform expansion and homogeneity on horizon scale are consistent
with MOND-dominated non-uniform expansion and the development of
inhomogeneities on smaller scale. In the radiation-dominated era, the amplitude
of MOND-induced inhomogeneities is much smaller than that implied by
observations of the cosmic background radiation, and the thermal and dynamical
history of the Universe is identical to that of the standard Big Bang. When
matter first dominates the energy density of the Universe, the cosmology
diverges from that of the standard model. Objects of galaxy mass are the first
virialized objects to form (by z=10) and larger structure develops rapidly. At

metric. The geodesic equation involves formally ill-defined products of
distributions due to the nonlinearity of the equations and the presence of the
Dirac $\de$-distribution in the space time metric. Thus, strictly speaking, it
cannot be treated within Schwartz's linear theory of distributions. To cope
with this difficulty we proceed by first regularizing the
$\de$-singularity,then solving the regularized equation within classical smooth
functions and, finally, obtaining a distributional limit as solution to the
original problem. Furthermore it is shown that this limit is independent of the
regularization without requiring any additional condition, thereby confirming
earlier results in a mathematical rigorous fashion. We also treat the Jacobi
equation which, despite being linear in the deviation vector field, involves
even more delicate singular expressions, like the ``square'' of the Dirac
$\de$-distribution. Again the same regularization procedure provides us with a
perfectly well behaved smooth regularization and a regularization-independent
distributional limit. Hence it is concluded that the geometry of impulsive
pp-waves can be described consistently using distributions as long as careful
regularization procedures are used to handle the ill-defined products.

in a formalism with extended causality by discrete finite transverse
point-vector fields with discrete and localized point interactions. These
fields are taken as a classical representation of photons, ``classical
photons"". They are all transversal photons; there are no scalar nor
longitudinal photons as these are definitely eliminated by the gauge condition.
The angular distribution of emitted photons coincides with the directions of
maximum emission in the standard formalism. The Maxwell formalism and its
standard field are retrieved by the replacement of these discrete fields by
their space-time averages, and in this process scalar and longitudinal photons
are necessarily created and added. Divergences and singularities are
by-products of this averaging process. This formalism enlighten the meaning and
the origin of the non-physical photons, the ones that violate the Lorentz
condition in manifestly covariant quantization methods.

It is argued that the appropriate dynamics on the other (black hole) side of
the transition is that of the zero modes of the corresponding super Yang-Mills
theory. A suggestive mean field theory argument is given for the entropy of
black holes in all dimensions. Consequences of the analysis for matrix theory
and the holographic principle are discussed.

inspired by Feynman's atomistic idea about the physical world and by the
extension of fluid dynamics to shorter distances through the Boltzmann
transport equation. The extending tt Lagrangians imply the original Lagrangians
as path-integralwise approximations. By constructing a tt Lagrangian that
extends a general gauge-invariant Lagrangian, we show that a tt extension of
the standard model is feasible. We define a tt Lagrangian in terms of tt fields
of the spacetime variable and an additional, four-vector variable. We explain
the fields of quantum field theories as certain covariant, local averages of tt
fields. Only two tt fields may be needed for modeling fundamental interactions:
(i) a four-vector one unifying all fundamental forces, and (ii) a
two-component-spinor one unifying all fundamental matter particles. We comment
on the new physics expected within the tt framework put forward, and point out
some open questions.

manifestations of the same covariant model. In particular, this covariant model
explains why the coherent amplitudes in the quark model become incoherent,
after a Lorentz boost, in the parton model. It is shown that this lack of
