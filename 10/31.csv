R_c-band observations were obtained on 1997 May 12, and three on May14. The

evidence for variability (<9%) on 10-70 minute time scales based on 11 R_c-band

of K>18.2. Comparison of these data points with those obtained by other authors
shows that the decay of the optical counterpart can be well fitted by a power
law of the form f ~ t**-alpha where alpha = 1.22 +/- 0.03 with occasional

another burst, GRB 970228, can also be well fitted with a power law with

two decay light curves are remarkably similar in form to that predicted by

Hubble Deep Field is presented as part of a long-term project aimed to settle
strong observational constraints to the theories modelling the evolution of
elliptical galaxies from the early stages. The sample has been extracted, in
the V_606 band, from the catalog by Couch (1996). The analysis of the
luminosity and geometrical profiles, carried out on 162 candidates obeying our
provisional selection criteria, resulted in a list of 99 'bona fide' early-type
galaxies, for which accurate total magnitudes and effective radii were
computed. The comparison with the magnitudes given by Williams et al.(1996)
indicates that the automated photometry tends to underestimate the total
luminosity of the ellipticals. The luminosity profiles of most of galaxies in
our sample follow fairly well the deVaucouleurs law (`Normal' profiles).
However, a relevant fraction of galaxies, even following the deVaucouleurs law
in the main body light distribution, exhibit in the inner region a flattening
of the luminosity profile not attributable to the PSF (`Flat' profiles) or, in
some cases, a complex (multi-nucleus) structure (`Merger' profiles). The
average ellipticity of galaxies belonging to the `Flat' and `Merger' classes is
found to be significantly higher than that of the `Normal' galaxies. Moreover,
even taken into account the relevant uncertainty of the outer position angle
profiles, the amount of isophotal twisting of HDF ellipticals turns out to be
significantly larger with respect to that of the local samples.

  replaced with the updated version to avoid confusion",,"10.1086/311092",,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  In the context of black hole spin in X-ray binaries, we propose that certain
type of quasi-period oscillations (QPOs) observed in the light curves of black
hole binaries (BHBs) are produced by X-ray modulation at the precession
frequency of accretion disks, due to relativistic dragging of inertial frames
around spinning black holes. These QPOs tend to be relatively stable in their
centroid frequencies. They have been observed in the frequency range of a few
to a few hundred Hz for several black holes with dynamically determined masses.
By comparing the computed disk precession frequency with that of the observed
QPO, we can derive the black hole angular momentum, given its mass. When
applying this model to GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, Cyg X-1, and GS 1124-68, we
found that the black holes in GRO J1655-40 and GRS 1915+105, the only known
BHBs that occasionally produce superluminal radio jets, spin at a rate close to
the maximum limit, while Cyg X-1 and GS 1124-68, typical (persistent and
transient) BHBs, contain only moderately rotating ones. Extending the model to
the general population of black hole candidates, the fact that only
low-frequency QPOs have been detected is consistent with the presence of only
slowly spinning black holes in these systems. Our results are in good agreement
with those derived from spectral data, thus strongly support the classification
scheme that we proposed previously for BHBs.

follow-up observations with the Narrow Field Intruments (NFI) was then
performed in a period from 6 hours to 6 days after the main event. A previously
unknown source, which we associate with the afterglow of the GRB, was
discovered in the error box. We find that, after the initial burst, X-ray
emission is still present and decays as t^(-1.1) up to 6 times 10^4 s. This is
followed by a burst of activity with a duration 10^5 s. The energy produced in
this event is a substantial fraction of the total energy of the GRB, which
means that the afterglow is not a remnant of the initial burst (the GRB) that
fades away smoothly. Our results support the idea that the processes generating
the GRB and its afterglow are the same.

value of 5.10E16 erg s-1. The spectrum is well fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung
model with a temperature of 0.29 +/- 0.06 keV, or a power-law with a photon
index of 3.1 +{0.6} -{0.2}. The lack of detected C and O line emission places
severe constraints on many models for cometary X-ray emission, especially those
which involve X-ray production in cometary gas. The luminosity is a factor of
at least 3.4 greater than measured by Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) 4
days later. This difference may be related to the emergence from the nucleus on
1996 September 9 of a dust-rich cloud. Over the next few days the cloud
continued to expand becoming increasingly tenuous, until it had reached an
extent of ~3.10E5 km (or ~2 arcmin) by the start of EUVE observation. We
speculate that the observed reduction in X-ray intensity is evidence for dust
fragmentation. These results support the view that cometary X-ray emission

categories assigned in this task are more syntactically, semantically, and
contextually complex than those typically assigned by fully automatic systems
that process unseen test data. Our system for assigning these categories is a
probabilistic classifier, developed with a recent method for formulating a
probabilistic model from a predefined set of potential features. This paper
focuses on feature selection. It presents a number of fully automatic features.
It identifies and evaluates various approaches to organizing collocational
properties into features, and presents the results of experiments covarying
type of organization and type of property. We find that one organization is not
best for all kinds of properties, so this is an experimental parameter worth
investigating in NLP systems. In addition, the results suggest a way to take
advantage of properties that are low frequency but strongly indicative of a
class. The problems of recognizing and organizing the various kinds of
contextual information required to perform a linguistically complex
categorization task have rarely been systematically investigated in NLP.

mean-spherical approximation (MSA). In the limit of a homogeneous fluid our
approach yields the well-known MSA (energy) equation of state. The ionic
interfacial density profiles, which for the RPM are identical for both species,
have a shape similar to those of simple atomic fluids in that the decay towards
the bulk values is more rapid on the vapor side than on the liquid side. This
is the opposite asymmetry of the decay to that found in earlier calculations
for the RPM based on a square-gradient theory. The width of the interface is,
for a wide range of temperatures, approximately four times the second moment
correlation length of the liquid phase. We discuss the magnitude and
temperature dependence of the surface tension, and argue that for temperatures
near the triple point the ratio of the dimensionless surface tension and
critical temperature is much smaller for the RPM than for simple atomic fluids.

E58, 1533 (1998)","10.1103/PhysRevE.58.1533",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  This work addresses nucleation rates in systems with strong initial
recombination. Initial (or `geminate') recombination is a process where a
dissociated structure (anion, vortex, kink etc.) recombines with its twin
brother (cation, anti-vortex, anti-kink) generated in the same nucleation
event. Initial recombination is important if there is an asymptotically
vanishing interaction force instead of a generic saddle-type activation
barrier. At low temperatures, initial recombination strongly dominates
homogeneous recombination. In a first part, we discuss the effect in one-,
two-, and three-dimensional diffusion controlled systems with spherical
symmetry. Since there is no well-defined saddle, we introduce a threshold which
is to some extent arbitrary but which is restricted by physically reasonable
conditions. We show that the dependence of the nucleation rate on the specific
choice of this threshold is strongest for one-dimensional systems and decreases
in higher dimensions. We discuss also the influence of a weak driving force and
show that the transport current is directly determined by the imbalance of the
activation rate in the direction of the field and the rate against this
direction. In a second part, we apply the results to the overdamped sine-Gordon
system at equilibrium. It turns out that diffusive initial recombination is the
essential mechanism which governs the equilibrium kink nucleation rate. We
emphasize analogies between the single particle problem with initial
recombination and the multi-dimensional kink-antikink nucleation problem.

(BBH) coalescence gravitational waves, focusing on the merger phase that occurs
after the gradual inspiral and before the ringdown. Our results are: (1) If
numerical relativity simulations have not produced template merger waveforms
before BBH detections by LIGO/VIRGO, one can band-pass filter the merger waves.
For BBHs smaller than about 40 solar masses detected via their inspiral waves,
the band pass filtering signal to noise ratio indicates that the merger waves
should typically be just barely visible in the noise for initial and advanced
LIGO interferometers. (2) We derive an optimized (maximum likelihood) method
for extracting a best-fit merger waveform from the noisy detector output; one
""perpendicularly projects"" this output onto a function space (specified using
wavelets) that incorporates our prior knowledge of the waveforms. An extension
of the method allows one to extract the BBH's two independent waveforms from
outputs of several interferometers. (3) If numerical relativists produce codes
for generating merger templates but running the codes is too expensive to allow
an extensive survey of the merger parameter space, then a coarse survey of this
parameter space, to determine the ranges of the several key parameters and to
explore several qualitative issues which we describe, would be useful for data
analysis purposes. (4) A complete set of templates could be used to test the
nonlinear dynamics of general relativity and to measure some of the binary
parameters. We estimate the number of bits of information obtainable from the
merger waves (about 10 to 60 for LIGO/VIRGO, up to 200 for LISA), estimate the
information loss due to template numerical errors or sparseness in the template
grid, and infer approximate requirements on template accuracy and spacing.

description of the spinning bodies. We simplify the calculations by introducing
into post-Newtonian theory a delta-function description of the influence of the
spins on the bodies' energy-momentum tensor. This description was recently used
by Mino, Shibata, and Tanaka (MST) in Teukolsky-formalism analyses of particles
orbiting massive black holes, and is based on prior work by Dixon. We compute
the 2PN contributions to the wave forms by combining the MST energy-momentum
tensor with the formalism of Blanchet, Damour, and Iyer for evaluating the
binary's radiative multipoles, and with the well-known 1.5PN order equations of
motion for the binary. Our results contribute at 2PN order only to the
amplitudes of the wave forms. The secular evolution of the wave forms' phase,
the quantity most accurately measurable by LIGO, is not affected by our results
until 2.5PN order, at which point other spin-orbit effects also come into play.

phase evolution in a future paper, using the techniques of this paper.

LEP II is able to unravel the existence of charginos with masses almost up to
its kinematical limit even in the case of R-parity violation. This requires the
study of several final state topologies since the usual MSSM chargino signature
is recovered as $\epsilon \to 0$. Moreover, for sufficiently large $\epsilon$
values, for which the chargino decay mode $\chi^\pm \to \tau^\pm J$ dominates,
we find through a dedicated Monte Carlo analysis that the $\chi^\pm$ mass
bounds are again very close to the kinematic limit. Our results establish the

know about Reggeons and what we do not. The major part of these lectures is
devoted to the Pomeron structure, to the answer to the questions: what is the
so called Pomeron; why it is so different from other Reggeons and why we have
to introduce it. In short, I hope that this lectures will be the shortest way
to learn everything about Reggeons from the beginning to the current
understanding. I concentrate on the problem of Reggeons in this lectures while
the Reggeon interactions or the shadowing corrections I plan to discuss in the
second part of my lectures. I include here only a short lecture with an outline
of the main properties of the shadowing corrections to discuss a correct (from
the point of the Reggeon approach) strategy of the experimental investigation
of the Pomeron structure.

that the series ought to converge within a finite radius of convergence. We
contrast such a behavior with the one obtained from a previous calculation that

monopole-antimonopole production in high-energy collisions such as $e^+e^-$
annihilation. Perturbative calculations for such processes are known to be
inherently ambiguous due to the arbitrariness of direction of the monopole
string; this requires use of some prescription to obtain physical results. We
argue that different prescriptions lead to drastically different physical
results which suggests that at present we do not have an entirely satisfactory
procedure for the elimination of string arbitrariness (this problem is quite
separate from the problems caused by the large coupling constant). We then
analyze the consequencies of discrete symmetries (P and C) for the monopole
production processes and for the monopole-antimonopole states. The P and C
selection rules for the monopole-antimonopole states turn out to be different
from those for the ordinary fermion-antifermion or boson-antiboson system. In
particular, the spin 1/2 monopole and antimonopole should have the same
helicities if they are produced through the one-photon annihilation of an
electron and positron. A stronger selection rule holds for spinless monopoles:
CP symmetry absolutely forbids the monopole-antimonopole production through the
one-photon annihilation of an electron and positron. Single-photon $e^+e^- \to
g^+g^-$ amplitude has been a key input in calculating the contribution of
virtual $g^+g^-$ pairs to various physical processes such as the decay $Z\to
3\gamma$ and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. Applying our
conclusions to these cases can lead to significant modifications of the results
obtained in previous works.

Via zero-brane parton scattering we find that each of the $2^9 = 512$ orbifold
fixed points carry $-1/32$ units of zero-brane charge. The anomalous flux is
cancelled by introducing a twisted sector consisting of 32 zero-branes that are
spacetime supersymmetry singlets. These twisted sector zero-branes are nothing
but gravitational waves propagating along the M-theory direction. There is no
D0-partons in the untwisted sector, a fact consistent with holographic
principle. For low-energy excitations, the orbifold compactification is
described by ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group
$SO(32)$.

the Euclidean metric on R^n from fixed energy scattering data is studied. It is
shown that if two such metrics, g1, g2, have scattering data at some fixed
energy which are equal up to smoothing, then there exists a diffeomorphism \psi
`fixing infinity' such that \psi^*(g1) - g2 is rapidly decreasing. Given the
scattering matrix at two energies, it is shown that the asymptotics of a metric
and a short range potential can be determined simultaneously. These results
also hold for a wide class of scattering manifolds.

pion form factor and imaginary parts of the t-channel p-wave piN-scattering

is developed for numerical evaluation of the two-pion contribution to the
isovector nucleon form factors. The results of different methods are compared

  Aspects of Nuclear Physics, August 1997; proceedings to be publ., T. Kodama
  et al., eds. (World Scientific)",,,,"quant-ph hep-ph nucl-th",,"  Entropy generation in quantum sytems is tied to the existence of a
nonclassical environment (heat bath or other) with which the system interacts.
The continuous `measuring' of the open system by its environment induces
decoherence of its wave function and entropy increase. Examples of
nonrelativistic quantum Brownian motion and of interacting scalar fields
illustrate these general concepts. It is shown that the Hartree-Fock
approximation around the bare classical limit can lead to spurious semiquantum
chaos, which may affect the determination of entropy production and
thermalization also in other cases.

independently. In this paper, valleys in the configuration space in quantum
mechanics are investigated as a way to treat them in a unified manner. All the
known results of the interplay of them are reproduced naturally. The
prescription for separating the non-perturbative contribution from the
perturbative is given in terms of the analytic continuation of the valley
parameter. Our method is illustrated on a new series of examples with the
asymmetric double-well potential. We obtain the non-perturbative part
explicitly, which leads to the prediction of the large order behavior of the
perturbative series. We calculate the first 200 perturbative coefficients for a
wide range of parameters and confirm the agreement with the prediction of the
valley method.

constructing explicit higher dimensional representations of graded Lie
