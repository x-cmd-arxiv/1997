halos have been used to infer that the scattering dust particles must be
fluffy. These fluffy dust particles have also been suggested as a possible
solution to the interstellar carbon ""crisis."" This crisis results from the
discrepancy between the available ISM carbon abundance and the amount required
to be in dust to account for the average ISM extinction. Dwek (1997), however,
pointed out that fluffy dust particles may not solve the carbon crisis. In
light of this, we re-examine the evidence for fluffy dust in the ISM from x-ray
scattering data.
  We find that previous studies overestimated the intensity of the halos by
using the RG approximation, which fails for energies below 1 keV. Using the
exact Mie solution we find that below 1 keV the scattering becomes much less
efficient. Applying the Mie calculations to the x-ray halo observed around Nova
Cygni 1992, we conclude that the data can be explained by scattering from
regular dust, and does not require interstellar dust particles to be fluffy.

strength of the tidal potential, it also increases with the shear viscosity.
Increasing the disc temperature has a retrograde impact upon the precession
rate.
  We find that motion relative to the binary potential results in
superhump-like, periodic luminosity variations in the outer reaches of an
eccentric disc. The nature and location of the luminosity modulation is a
function of the shear viscosity, nu. Light curves most similar to observations
are obtained for nu values appropriate for a dwarf nova in outburst.
  We investigate the thermal-tidal instability model for superoutburst. A dwarf
nova outburst is simulated by instantaneously increasing nu, which causes a
rapid radial expansion of the disc. Should the disc encounter the 3:1 eccentric
inner Lindblad resonance and become tidally unstable, then tidal torques become
much more efficient at removing angular momentum from the disc. The disc then
shrinks and mass flux through the disc increases. The resulting increase in
disc luminosity is found to be consistent with the excess luminosity of a
superoutburst.

recent reports of negative temperature gradients in some clusters by Markevitch

can exceed a few billion years beyond radii of a Mpc, if the intracluster gas
is assumed to be at the usual cluster virial temperature. If a cluster merger
has occurred within that time causing the protons, but not the electrons, to be
rapidly heated then a small negative temperature gradient can result. This
gradient is larger in clusters with high temperatures and steep density

intracluster medium will produce a detectable signature in the X-ray emission
from the cluster. The simplest kinematic information that can be extracted from
this signature is the galaxy's direction of motion on the plane of the sky.
This paper explores the constraints on cluster dynamics that could be derived
from such information. In particular, we show that it is possible to define a
projected anisotropy parameter, B(R), which is directly analogous to the usual
orbital anisotropy parameter. We describe an estimator for this quantity,
Bhat(R), which can be derived in a robust and straightforward manner. Using a
simple dynamical model, we demonstrate the ambiguity between the distribution
of mass and the distribution of galaxy orbits when interpreting the traditional
measures of cluster kinematics (the projected density of galaxies and their
line-of-sight velocity dispersion). As an example, we show how two very
different dynamical models can fit the kinematic properties of the Coma
cluster. We demonstrate that the measurement of Bhat using a relatively small
sample of wake directions (N_{wake} ~ 50) would provide an effective mechanism
for lifting this degeneracy. Thus, by combining X-ray measurements of wake
directions with number counts and line-of-sight velocities derived from optical
data, it will prove possible to measure both the orbit distribution and the
form of the gravitational potential in clusters of galaxies.

identified as signatures of selforganized criticality, a field of study
belonging to the newly emerging discipline of nonlinear dynamics and chaos. The
author has presented a universal thory of chaos which postulates that spatial
integration of enclosed small scale fluctuations result in the generation of a
hierarchical scale invariant eddy continuum(network) with ordered two-way
energy flow between the scales. The model concepts lead to the following
results. (1) The eddy energy spectrum follows normal distribution
characteristics,i.e.,the square of the eddy amplitude represents the
probability density,a result which is observed in the subatomic dynamics of
quantum systems. (2) Wave-particle duality is attributed to the bimodal
(formation and dissipation) phenomenological form for manifestation of energy
in the bidirectional energy flow intrinsic to eddy circulations,e.g., formation
and dissipation respectively of clouds in updrafts and downdrafts of
atmospheric eddies. (3) The nested continuum of eddy flow trajectories follow
Kepler's third law of planetary motion. Therefore,inverse square law form for
centripetal force, representing inertial or gravitational force is intrinsic to
the hierarchical eddy continuum. The above model is analogous to a superstring
model where manifestation of matter is visualised as vibrational modes in

${\cal R}(x,x'| g_{\mu\nu})$ connecting events $x$ and $x'$ in a spacetime

g_{\mu\nu})]$. In a recent paper, assuming the path integral amplitude to be
invariant under the duality transformation ${\cal R} \to (L_P^2/{\cal R})$,
Padmanabhan has evaluated the modified Feynman propagator in an arbitrary
curved spacetime. He finds that the essential feature of this `principle of
path integral duality' is that the Euclidean proper distance $(\Delta x)^2$
between two infinitesimally separated spacetime events is replaced by $[(\Delta
x)^2 + 4L_P^2 ]$. In other words, under the duality principle the spacetime
behaves as though it has a `zero-point length' $L_P$, a feature that is
expected to arise in a quantum theory of gravity. In the Schwinger's proper
time description of the Feynman propagator, the weightage factor for a path
with a proper time $s$ is $\exp-(m^2s)$. Invoking Padmanabhan's `principle of
path integral duality' corresponds to modifying the weightage factor
$\exp-(m^2s)$ to $\exp-[m^2s + (L_P^2/s)]$. In this paper, we use this modified
weightage factor in Schwinger's proper time formalism to evaluate the quantum
gravitational corrections to some of the standard quantum field theoretic
results in flat and curved spacetimes. We find that the extra factor
$\exp-(L_P^2/s)$ acts as a regulator at the Planck scale thereby `removing' the
divergences that otherwise appear in the theory. Finally, we discuss the wider

to exist only for two extreme spin (and magnetic moment) projections.
  Classical consideration confirms the conclusion. Motion of a classical
magnetized particle with generally oriented magnetic moment in the AC field
appears to be subjected to both forces and torques. Only for two special
orientations of the magnetic moment (same as in the quantum case) the motion is
effectively free and similar to the AB motion of a charged particle. Thus, the

parallel on first sight. When adaptive schemes are applied in order to enhance
convergence however, the seemingly most natural way of replicating the whole
job on each processor can potentially ruin the adaptive behaviour. Using the
popular VEGAS-Algorithm as an example an economic method of semi-micro
parallelization with variable grain-size is presented and contrasted with
another straightforward approach of macro-parallelization. A portable
implementation of this semi-micro parallelization is used in the xloops-project
and is made publicly available.

algebra $\virpq$. In particular, we give a proof of the formula for the Kac
determinant and then determine the center of $\virpq$ for $q$ a primitive N-th
root of unity. We derive explicit expressions for the generators of the center
in the limit $t=qp^{-1}\to \infty$ and elucidate the connection to the
Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions. Furthermore, we argue that for
$q=\sqrtN{1}$ the algebra describes `Gentile statistics' of order $N-1$, i.e.,
a situation in which at most $N-1$ particles can occupy the same state.

situations. A criterion for the selection of the auxiliary quantum mechanical
problem is also advanced.

  Mechanics","8 pages, REVTEX. Added comparison with Kaluza-Klein theories, other
  minor revisions",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Examination of the Einstein energy-momentum relationship suggests that simple
unbound forms of matter exist in a four-dimensional Euclidean space. Position,
momentum, velocity, and other vector quantities can be expressed as Euclidean
four-vectors, with the magnitude of the velocity vector having a constant
value, the speed of light. We see that charge may be simply a manifestation of
momentum in the new fourth direction, which implies that charge conservation is
a form of momentum conservation. The constancy of speed implies that all
elementary free particles can be described in the same manner as photons, by
means of a wave equation. The resulting wave mechanics (with a few small
assumptions) is simply the traditional form of quantum mechanics. If one begins
by assuming the wave nature of matter, it is shown that special relativistic
results follow simply. Thus we see evidence of a strong connection between
relativity and quantum mechanics. Comparisons between the theory presented here
and Kaluza-Klein theories reveal some similarities, but also many significant
differences between them.

evolution of computations and its relation to the measurement process.

of ions is discussed, and compared to that due to spontaneous emission.
