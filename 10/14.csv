considering the actual, deeply non-linear density field, which we compare to
the popular Press-Schechter approximation. We show the mass function is a
function of a unique parameter that contains all the dependence on the mass and
radius of the object. It enables us to derive the mass function of general
astrophysical objects (in addition to just-virialized halos) which may be
defined by any density threshold, that may even vary with the mass of the
object. This is beyond the reach of usual formulations based on the initial
gaussian field and gives a clear illustration of the advantages of our
approach. We explain why numerical tests seem to favor both Press-Schechter and
non-linear prescriptions even though the two approximations differ by their
scaling as a function of mass as well as a function of redshift. The difference
between the two is due to the fact that the Press-Schechter prescription
assumes that present-day mass fluctuations can be recognized in the early
linear universe, and that their number is conserved, while the non-linear
approach takes into account their evolution which leads to an increase of the
number of highly non-linear objects (very large or small masses). This
difference is seen to be of the same magnitude as the difference obtained by
varying the initial spectrum of density fluctuations. Earlier conclusions drawn
about the relevance of the latter using analytical approximations to the mass
function must thus be reexamined.

distribution and the anisotropy of the stellar orbits in this galaxy.
  We have developed a non-parametric technique to determine the DF f(E,L^2)
directly from the kinematic data. From Monte Carlo tests using the spatial
extent, sampling, and error bars of the NGC 6703 data we find that smooth
underlying DFs can be recovered to an rms accuracy of 12%, and the anisotropy
parameter beta(r) to an accuracy of 0.1, in a given potential. An
asymptotically constant halo circular velocity v_0 can be determined with an
accuracy of +- \lta 50km/s.
  For NGC 6703 we determine the true circular velocity at 2.6 R_e to be 250 +-
40km/s at 95% c.l., corresponding to a total mass in NGC 6703 inside 78'' (13.5
h_50^-1 kpc), of 1.6-2.6 x 10^11 h_50^-1 Msun. No model without dark matter
will fit the data; however, a maximum stellar mass model in which the luminous
component provides nearly all the mass in the centre does. In such a model, the
total luminous mass inside 78'' is 9 x 10^10 Msun and the integrated
M/L_B=5.3-10, corresponding to a rise from the center by at least a factor of
1.6.
  The anisotropy of the stellar distribution function in NGC 6703 changes from
near-isotropic at the centre to slightly radially anisotropic (beta=0.3-0.4 at
30'', beta=0.2-0.4 at 60'') and is not well-constrained at the outer edge of
the data.
  Our results suggest that also elliptical galaxies begin to be dominated by
dark matter at radii of \sim 10kpc.

destroyed by the heating due to the black hole and that a very weak density
cusp ($\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha \sim 0.5$) is formed around the
black hole. This result is consistent with recent observations of large
elliptical galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope. The velocity of the stars
becomes tangentially anisotropic in the inner region, while in the outer region
the stars have radially anisotropic velocity dispersion. The radius of the weak
cusp region is larger for larger black hole mass. Our result naturally explains
the formation of the weak cusp found in the previous simulations of galaxy

boundary of arbitrary topology is determined in simplicial minisuperspace. The
minisuperspace is defined by the assignment of a single internal edge length to
all 1-simplices emanating from the cone vertex, and a single boundary edge
length to all 1-simplices lying on the boundary. The Regge action is analyzed
in the space of complex edge lengths, and it is shown that there are three
finite branch points in this complex plane. A closed contour of integration
encircling the branch points is shown to yield a convergent real wave function.
This closed contour can be deformed to a steepest descent contour for all sizes
of the bounding universe. In general, the contour yields an oscillating wave
function for universes of size greater than a critical value which depends on
the topology of the bounding universe. For values less than the critical value
the wave function exhibits exponential behaviour. It is shown that the critical
value is positive for spherical topology in arbitrary dimensions. In three
dimensions we compute the critical value for a boundary universe of arbitrary
genus, while in four and five dimensions we study examples of product manifolds

observationally consistent alternative halo models that produce the same halo
contributions to the local and asymptotic rotation speeds to investigate the
effects of theoretical uncertainty of the WIMP spatial and velocity
distribution. We use self-consistent models to take into account the effects of
various mass distributions on the local velocity distribution. The local halo
density may be increased up to a factor of 2 by flattening or by an alternative
radial profile (which may also decrease the density slightly). However, changes
in the WIMP velocity distribution in these models produce only negligible
changes in the WIMP detection rate. Reasonable bulk rotations lead to only an

properties of strange hadrons are suggestive of the formation of a
color-deconfined, thermally and nearly chemically equilibrated phase, which
provides at present the only comprehensive framework to describe all

split of the matrix model Hamiltonian into a free part describing the free
propagation of these particle states along with the interaction Hamiltonian
describing their interactions. Elementary quantum mechanical perturbation
theory then yields an effective potential for these particles as an expansion
in their inverse separation. Remarkably we find that the leading velocity
independent terms of the effective potential cancel in agreement with the fact
that there is no force between stationary D0 branes. The scheme we present
