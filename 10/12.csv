is investigated for a velocity-strengthening friction law. It shows
self-organized criticality with complex scaling exponents. That is, the
probability density function of the avalanche strength is a power law times a
log-periodic function. Exact results (scaling exponent: $3/2+2\pi i/\ln 4$) are
found for a nonlocal cellular automaton which approximates the overdamped train
model. Further the influence of random static friction is discussed.

${36(g+1)}/(5g+1)$ for the slope of trigonal fibrations. Here, the slope of any
fibration $X\to B$ of stable curves with smooth general member is the ratio
$\delta_B/\lambda_B$ of the restrictions of the boundary class $\delta$ and the
Hodge class $\lambda$ on the moduli space $\bar{\mathfrak{M}}_g$ to the base
$B$. We associate to a trigonal family $X$ a canonical rank two vector bundle
$V$, and show that for Bogomolov-semistable $V$ the slope satisfies the
stronger inequality ${\delta_B}/{\lambda_B}\leq 7+{6}/{g}$. We further describe
the rational Picard group of the {trigonal} locus $\bar{\mathfrak T}_g$ in the
moduli space $\bar{\mathfrak{M}}_g$ of genus $g$ curves. In the even genus
case, we interpret the above Bogomolov semistability condition in terms of the
so-called Maroni divisor in $\bar{\mathfrak T}_g$.

observations in April 1997 show that a substantial fraction of the total AGN
power is at TeV energies indicating that high energy processes dominate the
energetics of this object. Rapid variability, on time scales of less than a
day, and a flat spectrum extending up to at least 10 TeV characterize this
object. Results of 1997 observations by 6 telescopes are summarized and some of
the implications of these results are discussed.

which are particularly useful for describing the gas dynamics of cosmic
structure formation. For ideal gas with gamma=5/3, the supercomoving position,
velocity, density, temperature, and pressure are constant in time in a uniform,
isotropic, adiabatically expanding universe. Expressed in terms of these
supercomoving variables, the cosmological fluid conservation equations and the
Poisson equation closely resemble their noncosmological counterparts. This
makes it possible to generalize noncosmological results and techniques to
cosmological problems, for a wide range of cosmological models. These variables
were initially introduced by Shandarin for matter-dominated models only. We
generalize supercomoving variables to models with a uniform component
corresponding to a nonzero cosmological constant, domain walls, cosmic strings,
a nonclumping form of nonrelativistic matter (e.g. massive nettrinos), or
radiation. Each model is characterized by the value of the density parameter
Omega0 of the nonrelativistic matter component in which density fluctuation is
possible, and the density parameter OmegaX of the additional, nonclumping
component. For each type of nonclumping background, we identify FAMILIES within
which different values of Omega0 and OmegaX lead to fluid equations and
solutions in supercomoving variables which are independent of Omega0 and
OmegaX. We also include the effects of heating, radiative cooling, thermal
conduction, viscosity, and magnetic fields. As an illustration, we describe 3
familiar cosmological problems in supercomoving variables: the growth of linear
density fluctuations, the nonlinear collapse of a 1D plane-wave density
fluctuation leading to pancake formation, and the Zel'dovich approximation.

in a given row or column. This leads to a mesh of isolated spin-chains running
along the X and Y axes. A weaker exchange constant J' couples the
nearest-neighbor spins on the lattice. Classically, J' fails to fix the
relative spin orientation for different chains and hence the ground state is
highly degenerate. Quantum order by disorder effect is studied by spin-wave
theory and numerical methods. It is shown that a 4-sublattice order is favored
by quantum fluctuations. However, several arguments are presented that suggest
that the ground state of the system remains disordered, thus providing us with
a paradigm for a two-dimensional spin-liquid.

10^{-3}$ for all values of $U$ using diagonalizations of 12-site (20-site)

function of the onsite repulsion interaction $U$ has a maximum at nonzero
values of $U$, if the electron-phonon coupling $g$ is lower than a critical
value $g_c$. The critical value $g_c$ is found with high accuracy to be
$g_c=0.69$. For smaller values of $g$ the position of the maximum of $d(U)$ is
approximately $3t$, and rapidly tends to zero as $g$ approaches $g_c$ from
