Our treatment assumes a Schwarzschild geometry for the spacetime outside the
neutron star and is fully general relativistic. At all the accretion rates
studied, the response of the accretion flow to perturbations includes weakly
damped oscillatory modes. At sufficiently high luminosities --- but still well
below the Eddington limit --- the flows become unstable to aspherical
perturbations. These unstable radiation hydrodynamic modes resemble the onset
of convection, and allow accretion to occur preferentially through more rapidly
descending columns of gas, while the radiation produced escapes through
neighboring columns in which the gas descends more slowly.

different in the two spectral states. In the soft state of the source a shot
with a very large strength has been identified and it has exponential rise and

presence of persistent quasi-regular bursts with different structures. Only one
of the three types of bursts is regular in occurrence revealing a stable
profile over extended durations. The regular bursts have an exponential rise
with a time scale of about 7 s to 10 s and a sharp linear decay in 2 to 3 s.
The X-ray spectrum becomes progressively harder as the burst evolves and it is
the hardest near the end of the burst decay. The profile and energetics of the
bursts in this black hole candidate source are distinct from both the type I
and type II X-ray bursts observed in neutron star sources. We propose that the
sharp decay in the observed burst pattern is a signature of the disappearance
of matter through the black hole horizon. The regular pattern of the bursts can
be produced by material influx into the inner disk due to oscillations in a
shock front far away from the compact object.

Surface brightness and total magnitude measurements indicate that BK5N and F8D1
have similar central surface brightness (24.5 and 25.4 mag/arcsec^2 in V,
respectively), but F8D1's larger length scale results in it being 3 magnitudes
more luminous than BK5N. BK5N lies on the relation between central surface
brightness and absolute magnitude defined by Local Group dwarf ellipticals, but
F8D1 does not. F8D1 is more luminous for its central surface brightness than
the relation predicts, similar to the large low surface brightness dwarf
galaxies found in, for example, Virgo. The mean color of the giant branch is
used to establish the mean abundance of each galaxy. F8D1, the more luminous
galaxy, is significantly more metal rich ([Fe/H] ~ -1.0) than BK5N ([Fe/H] ~
-1.7). Both BK5N and F8D1 lie on the relation between absolute magnitude and
metal abundance defined by Local Group dwarf ellipticals. However, as regards
the relation between central surface brightness and metal abundance, BK5N again
follows the Local Group dwarfs, while F8D1 deviates significantly from this

the source and we obtain a power law photon index of 1.62 +- 0.07. To constrain
the spectral shape of the source, we have analyzed the archival EXOSAT ME argon
and GSPC data in the low energies (2-20 keV band) as well as the archival OSSE
data in the high energies (50-500 keV). The data in different energy bands are
not obtained in simultaneous observations, but they pertain to the gamma_2
state of the source. We have attempted a combined fit to the wide band data
using appropriate mutual detector calibrations. A combined fit to the EXOSAT
and XMPC data (2-100 keV) shows that the observed spectrum requires a low
energy absorption corresponding to the Galactic interstellar absorption, a low
energy excess modeled as blackbody, a narrow emission line due to iron K_alpha
and a continuum. The continuum can be either modeled as a power law with a
reflection bump or a Comptonisation model with an additional bump which can be
modeled as the partial covering with a heavy absorber. To resolve between these
two models, we have attempted combined fit to the 2-500 keV data obtained from
EXOSAT, XMPC and OSSE. We find that two component Comptonisation model
adequately represents the data. We explore the possible emission region that is

nearly-Keplerian star clusters is greatly increased by a process termed
resonant relaxation (Rauch & Tremaine 1996), who also argued that tidal
disruption of stars in galactic nuclei containing massive black holes could be
noticeably enhanced by this process. We describe here the results of numerical
simulations of resonant tidal disruption which quantitatively test the
predictions made by Rauch & Tremaine. The simulation method is based on an
N-body routine incorporating cloning of stars near the loss cone and a
semi-relativistic symplectic integration scheme. We also briefly describe the
discovery of chaos in the Wisdom-Holman symplectic integrator applied to highly
eccentric orbits and propose a modified integration scheme that remains robust
under these conditions.
  We find that resonant disruption rates exceed their non-resonant counterparts
by an amount consistent with the predictions; in particular, we estimate the
net tidal disruption rate for a fully resonant cluster to be about twice that
of its non-resonant counterpart. No significant enhancement in rates is
observed outside the critical radius. Relativistic quenching of the effect is
found to occur for hole masses M>8*10^7 solar masses. The numerical results
combined with the observed properties of galactic nuclei indicate that for most
galaxies the resonant enhancement to tidal disruption rates will be very small.

fraction of galaxies having morphological or kinematical peculiarities, nuclear
radio and infrared emission, and starburst or active galactic nuclei (AGN)
activity. They contain large quantities of diffuse gas and are dynamically
dominated by dark matter. They most likely form as subsystems within looser
associations and evolve by gravitational processes. Strong galaxy interactions
result and merging is expected to lead to the ultimate demise of the group.

measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite
descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those
definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in

perspective was the rather low agreement (K=0.63) that we obtained using

about antecedents was also not complete. These findings raise questions
concerning the strategy of evaluating systems for definite description
interpretation by comparing their results with a standardized annotation. From
a linguistic point of view, the most interesting observations were the great
number of discourse-new definites in our corpus (in one of our experiments,
about 50% of the definites in the collection were classified as discourse-new,
30% as anaphoric, and 18% as associative/bridging) and the presence of

observed in RP(2) but this is illusory and is due to the proximity of the new
