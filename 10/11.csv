distributed uniformly random in log(r) between 0.2 and 50 AU. A conservative
stability criterion is imposed by requiring that adjacent planets are separated

Least-squares fits of these systems to generalized Bode laws are performed, and
compared to the fit of our own Solar System. We find that this stability
criterion, and other ``radius-exclusion'' laws, generally produce approximately
geometrically spaced planets that fit a Titius-Bode law about as well as our
own Solar System. We then allow the random systems the same exceptions that
have historically been applied to our own Solar System. Namely, one gap may be
inserted, similar to the gap between Mars and Jupiter, and up to 3 planets may
be ``ignored'', similar to how some forms of Bode's law ignore Mercury,
Neptune, and Pluto. With these particular exceptions, we find that our Solar
System fits significantly better than the random ones. However, we believe that
this choice of exceptions, designed specifically to give our own Solar System a
better fit, gives it an unfair advantage that would be lost if other exception
rules were used. We conclude that the significance of Bode's law is simply that
stable planetary systems tend to be regularly spaced; this conclusion could be
strengthened by the use of more stringent methods of rejecting unstable solar
systems, such as long-term orbit integrations.

lexical probabilities from a limited training corpus is that the statistical
model may not necessarily represent the use of a particular word in a
particular context. In a highly morphologically inflected language, this
argument is particularly serious since a word can be tagged with a large number
of parts of speech. Due to the lack of sufficient training data, we argue
against estimating lexical probabilities to disambiguate parts of speech in
unrestricted texts. Instead, we use the strength of contextual probabilities
along with a feature we call ``genotype'', a set of tags associated with a
word. Using this knowledge, we have built a part-of-speech tagger that combines
linguistic and statistical approaches: contextual information is disambiguated
by linguistic rules and n-gram probabilities on parts of speech only are
estimated in order to disambiguate the remaining ambiguous tags.

First, by introducing new angle variables with a straightforward geometrical
meaning. Second, by finding a new parametrization of a generic orbit, which
assures that the integration over a radial period can be done in an especially
simple way, by applying the residue theorem. The instantaneous radiation losses
of the system are computed using the formulation of Blanchet, Damour and

to define the running coupling constant in the spacelike region. However, to
describe processes with timelike momenta transfers, it is important to have a
self-consistent determination of the running coupling constant in the timelike
region. The technique called analytic perturbation theory (APT) allows a
consistent determination of this running coupling constant. The results are
found to disagree significantly with those obtained in the standard
perturbative approach. Comparison between the standard approach and APT is
carried out to two loops, and threshold matching in APT is applied in the
timelike region.

equations in $2n$ dimensions. The Born-Infeld-type action describing this

invariant only in four dimensions. A dual form of the action is found (no
isometries are required). In four dimensions, the dual geometry is self-dual
gravity without torsion coupled to a scalar field. In $D>4$ dimensions, the
dual geometry is hermitian and determined by a $D-4$ form potential $K$,
generalising the K\""{a}hler potential of the four dimensional case, with the
fundamental 2-form given by $\tilde J= i*\partial \bar \partial K$. The
coupling to Yang-Mills is through a term $K\wedge tr (F\wedge F)$ and leads to
