from a NaI(Tl) 100 kg underground detector run at the Gran Sasso Laboratory by
the DAMA/NaI group, the speaker concluded there was a hint for a WIMP of mass
60 GeV with a cross section on proton of 10-5 pb (Spin Independent coupling)
(see also ROM2F/97/33). Even if no claim of any definite signal is made, such a
statement is strong enough to deserve a critical look. The present note puts
forward a few arguments which point towards a largely overestimated statistical
significance of the effect, an inconsistency in the energy distribution and
several experimental effects which could easily mimic the observed excess. The
conclusion is that, in no way, the presented result can be considered as a hint
of a WIMP annual modulation.

  the Nov. 20 issue of ApJ",,"10.1086/304840",,"astro-ph",,"  The first detailed VLA mapping of the neutral hydrogen distribution in the
isolated, edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3044 is presented. Physical parameters
determined for this galaxy are typical for galaxies of its morphological class
(SBc). We have modelled the HI spectra in order to derive its global density
and velocity distributions. An HI scale height of 420 h^(-1) pc is thus found.
This can be compared to the 8 kpc radio continuum halo found previously.
  The present study reveals an asymmetry in the HI distribution as well as
numerous high-latitude HI structures at various galactocentric radii.
  Twelve high-latitude features were catalogued, of which four exhibit the
signature of an expanding shell. There is some correlation of these features
with features observed in the radio continuum from independent data. The most
massive shell (Feature 10) extends out to 6h^(-1) kpc above the galactic disk.
The radii and masses of these shells range from 1.2h^(-1) - 2.0h^(-1) kpc and
1.6 10^7 - 5.5 10^7h^(-2) solar masses, respectively. We have investigated the
possibility that the supershells could have been produced by external impacting
clouds, but conclude that this scenario is unattractive, given the age of the
shells, the isolation of the galaxy, and the lack of any observed features
sufficiently massive to form the shells in the vicinity of the galaxy.
Therefore, an internal origin is suggested. Since the implied input energies
from supernovae are extremely high (e.g. from 1.4 10^(53)h^(-20 - 7.4
10^(55)h^(-2) ergs, corresponding to 400 - 74,000 supernovae), we suggest that
some additional energy (e.g. from magnetic fields) may be needed to produce the
observed supershells.

1) Plasma clouds with different density profiles will lead to different
Comptonization energy spectra even though they have the same optical depth and
temperature. On the other hand, clouds with different optical depths can
produce the same energy spectra as long as their radial density distributions
are properly chosen. Thus by fitting the energy spectrum alone, it is not
possible to uniquely determine the optical depth of the Comptonization cloud,
let alone its density structure. 2) The phase or time difference as a function
of Fourier frequency or period for the X-rays in two energy bands is sensitive
to the radial density distribution of the scattering cloud. Comptonization in
plasma clouds with non-uniform density profiles can account for the long
standing puzzle of the frequency-dependent hard X-ray lags of Cygnus X-1 and
other sources. Thus simultaneously fitting the observed spectral and temporal
X-ray properties will allow us to probe the density structure of the

wavelengths. Such features may indicate variations in the surface density of
stellar mass, contributions from young red supergiants in star forming regions,
or substantial dust obscuration. To distinguish among these possibilities, we
have searched for spatial variations in the 2.3 micron photometric CO index
within the disks of three nearby galaxies (NGC 278, NGC 2649, & NGC 5713). This
index measures the strength of the absorption bands of molecular CO in stellar
atmospheres, and is strong in cool, low surface-gravity stars, reaching the
largest values for red supergiants. We observe significant spatial CO index
variations in two galaxies (NGC 278 & NGC 5713), indicating that the dominant
stellar population in the near-infrared is not everywhere the same. Central CO
index peaks are present in two galaxies; these could be due to either
metallicity gradients or recent star formation activity. In addition,
significant azimuthal CO index variations are seen in NGC 278. Because strong
azimuthal metallicity gradients are physically implausible in disk galaxies,
these features are most naturally explained by the presence of a young stellar
population. The fraction of 2 micron light due to young stellar populations in
star forming regions can be calculated from our data. Overall, young stellar
populations can contribute ~3% of a (normal) galaxy's near infrared flux.
Locally, this fraction may rise to ~33%. Thus, young stars do not dominate the
total near infrared flux, but can be locally dominant in star forming regions,
and can bias estimates of spiral arm amplitude or other nonaxisymmetric
structures in galaxies' mass distributions.

galaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies, we suggest that CO emission can be
hardly detected from galaxies with redshift $z \sim 1 - 4$ unless some
amplification either by galaxy mergers and/or by gravitational lensing is
working. Therefore, our study explains reasonably why CO emission was detected

reported by the MACHO collaboration. Once corrected for blending, the Einstein
radius crossing time is 123 days, corresponding to lensing by a Halo object of
$2.6^{+8.2}_{-2.3} M_{\odot}$. The maximum magnification is a factor of 2.6.
The light curve also displays a periodic modulation with a 2.5% amplitude and a

the SMC could have a mass as low as $0.07 M_{\odot}}$. We estimate the optical
depth for microlensing towards the SMC due to this event to be $\sim 3.3 \times

order of 1 Mpc or less the differential equation is elliptical. To solve it, we
have used the numerical method based on ""Simultaneous Over Relaxation"", SOR,
with Chebyshev acceleration and we have treated the problem as a boundary value
problem, which restricts the prediction ability of the integration. For
large-scale flux tubes, much larger than 1 Mpc, the equation can be
analytically integrated and no assumption about the final shape or magnitude of
the inhomogeneity is required. In both cases we obtain an evolution which does
not differ very much from linear in time. The inhomogeneity in the density
becomes filamentary. Large scale structures ($\ge$ 10 Mpc) are probably
unaffected by damping, non-linear and amplification mechanisms after Equality,
so that this model provides a tool to interpret the present observed large
scale structure.
  Filaments are very frequently found in the large-scale structure in the
Universe. It is suggested here that they could arise from primordial magnetic
flux tubes, thus providing an alternative hypothesis for its interpretation; in

equilibrium emerges in the system, and temperature can be introduced. However,
the interaction between the particles and their finite number can lead to
prominent deviations of the equilibrium occupation numbers distribution from

amplification on the transmission and reflection coefficient of a periodic

the tight-binding model where the transmission and reflection increase for
small lengths before strongly oscillating with a maximum at a certain length.
For larger lengths the transmission decays exponentially with the same rate as
in the growing region while the reflection saturates at a high value. However,
the maximum transmission (and reflection) moves to larger lengths and diverges
in the limit of vanishing amplification instead of going to unity. In very
large samples, it is anticipated that the presence of disorder and the
associated length scale will limit this uninhibited growth in amplification.
Also, there are other interesting competitive effects between disorder and
localization giving rise to some nonmonotonic behavior in the peak of
transmission.

  completely rewritten. Now includes effects of surf. stress on sharp cracks",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  We use computer simulations to study the behavior of atomically sharp and
blunted cracks in various f.c.c. metals. The simulations use effective medium
potentials which contain many-body interactions. We find that when using
potentials representing platinum and gold a sharp crack is stable with respect
to the emission of a dislocation from the crack tip, whereas for all other
metals studied the sharp crack is unstable. This result cannot be explained by
existing criteria for the intrinsic ductile/brittle behavior of crack tips, but
is probably caused by surface stresses. When the crack is no longer atomically
sharp dislocation emission becomes easier in all the studied metals. The effect
is relatively strong; the critical stress intensity factor for emission to
occur is reduced by up to 20%. This behavior appears to be caused by the
surface stress near the crack tip. The surface stress is a consequence of the
many-body nature of the interatomic interactions. The enhanced dislocation
emission can cause an order-of-magnitude increase in the fracture toughness of
certain materials, in which a sharp crack would propagate by cleavage.
Collisions with already existing dislocations will blunt the crack, if this
prevents further propagation of the crack the toughness of the material is
dramatically increased.

Caratheodory distance for complex manifolds. Moreover, unitizations of

d-contractions. Quotients of the operator algebra of the d-shift are much more
well-behaved than quotients of function algebras. Completely isometric

described by the Tolman-Bondi-Lema{\^i}tre metric. The main new result here
relates, in a general way, the formation of black holes and naked
shell-focusing singularities resulting as the final fate of such a collapse to
the generic form of regular initial data. Such a data is characterized in terms
of the density and velocity profiles of the matter, specified on an initial
time slice from which the collapse commences. We show that given any generic
density profile at the initial time slice, there exists a corresponding
velocity profile which gives rise to a strong curvature naked singularity. This
establishes that strong naked singularities arise for a generic density
profile. We also establish here that similar results hold for black hole
formation as well. Keeping the model to be spherically symmetric we also
consider more general form of matter fields, i.e. equation of state $p =
k\rho$. We will analyse here the nature of non-central singularity forming due
to collapse of spherically symmetric perfect fluid subject to weak energy

that the Polyakov gauge projected Abelian configurations do not have a
consistent physical meaning. We also apply the smoothing on SU(2)
configurations to test how sensitive Abelian dominance in the maximal Abelian
gauge is to the short distance fluctuations. We find that on smoothed SU(2)
configurations the Abelian string tension was about 30% smaller than the SU(2)
string tension which was unaffected by smoothing. This suggests that the

the higher cumulants in this limit vanish. We also show that at large
distances, apart from the integration over metrics, the obtained string
effective theory (which in this case reduces to the nonlinear massive axionic
sigma model) coincides with the low-energy limit of the dual version of 4D
compact QED, the so-called Universal Confining String Theory. We derive string
tension of the Nambu-Goto term and the coupling constant of the rigidity term
for the obtained string effective theory and demonstrate that the latter one is
always negative, which means the stability of strings, while the positiveness
of the former is confirmed by the present lattice data. These data enable us to
find the Higgs boson charge and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs
field, which model QCD best of all. We also study dynamics of the weight factor
