cotangent bundle to $M$. We show that in the formal neighborhood of the zero
section $M \subset T^*M$ the space $T^*M$ admits a canonical hyperkaehler
structure, compatible with the complex and holomorphic symplectic structures on
$T^*M$. The associated hyperkaehler metric $h$ coincides with the given Kaehler
metric on the zero section $M \subset T^*M$. Moreover, $h$ is invariant under
the canonical circle action on $T^*M$ by dilatations along the fibers of $T^*M$
over $M$. We show that a hyperkaehler structure with these properties is
unique. When the Kaehler metric on $M$ is real-analytic, we show that this
formal hyperkaehler structure can be extended to an open neighborhood of the
zero section. We also prove a hyperkaehler analog of the Darboux-Weinstein
Theorem. To prove these results, we use the machinery of $R$-Hodge structures,
following Deligne and Simpson.

dependent on the cosmological model, which makes a direct measure of the bias
quite difficult. However, it is showed that Rb is independent on the power

the bias times a function of the cosmological parameters. From R, a new

ages of Galactic globular clusters. First, we discuss the relevant galaxy
formation models and describe the detailed predictions they make with respect
to the formation timescale and chemical evolution of the globular clusters.
Next, the techniques used to estimate globular cluster ages are described and
evaluated with particular emphasis on the advantages and disadvantages of each
method. With these techniques as a foundation, we present arguments in favor of
the following assertions: 1) The age of a globular cluster is the likeliest
candidate to be the global second parameter, which along with metal abundance,
controls the morphology of the horizonal branch. 2) A total age range of as
much as $\sim$5 Gyr exists among the bulk of the Galactic globulars. 3) There
is a significant relation between age and metallicity among the Galactic
globular clusters if the slope of the \mvrr-\feh relation is less than
$\sim$0.23. These conclusions along with other supporting evidence favor a
formation scenario in which the inner regions of the Galactic halo collapsed in
a monotonic fashion over a short time period much less than 1 Gyr. In contrast,
the outer regions of the halo fragmented and collapsed in a chaotic manner over
several Gyrs.

observed across elliptical galaxies and from one object to another. Furthermore
arguments are given for an enhancement of Mg (\alfa in general) with respect to
Fe toward the center of these galaxies. In this study we have investigated the
ability of the H_beta, Mg2 and <Fe> diagnostics to assess the metallicity,
[Mg/Fe] ratios, and ages of elliptical galaxies. To this aim, first we derive
basic calibrations for the variations dH_beta, dMg2 and d<Fe> as a function of
Dlog(t), Dlog(Z/Zo), and D[Mg/Fe]. Second, we analyze how the difference
dH_beta, dMg2, and d<Fe> between the external and central values translates
into D[Mg/Fe], Dlog(Z/Zo), and Dlog(t). Third, we explore the variation from
galaxy to galaxy of the nuclear values of H_beta, Mg2, and <Fe> limited to a
sub-sample of the Gonzales (1993) list. The differences dH_beta, dMg2, and
d<Fe> are converted into the differences Dlog(t), Dlog(Z/Zo), and D[Mg/Fe].
Various correlations among the age, metallicity, and enhancement variations are
explored. In particular we thoroughly examine the relationship Dlog(t)-Mv. It
is found that a sort of age limit is likely to exist in this plane, traced by
galaxies with mild or no sign of rejuvenation. In these objects, the duration
of the star forming activity is likely to have increased at decreasing galactic
mass. The results are discussed in the context of current theories of galaxy
formation and evolution. i.e. merger and isolation. Finally, the suggestion is
advanced that models with time and space dependent IMF might be able to
alleviate some of the difficulties encountered by the standard SN-driven
galactic wind model.

hydrodynamic jet collimation models applicable to Young Stellar Objects (YSOs).
In our models aspherical bubbles form from the interaction of a central YSO
wind with an aspherical circum-protostellar density distribution. Building on a
previous non-radiative study (Frank & Mellema 1996) we demonstrate that
supersonic jets are a natural and robust consequence of aspherical wind-blown
bubble evolution. The simulations show that the addition of radiative cooling
makes the hydrodynamic collimation mechanisms studied by Frank & Mellema (1996)
more effective. An unexpected result is the production of cool, dense jets
forming through conical converging flows at the poles of the bubbles. For
steady winds the formation of these jets occurs early in the bubble evolution.
At later times we find that the dynamical and cooling time scales for the jet
material become similar. Since observations of YSO jets show considerable
variability in the jet beam we present a simple one-dimensional (1-D) model for
the evolution of a variable wind interacting with an accreting environment.
These models indicate that, in the presence of a varying protostellar wind, the
hydrodynamic collimation processes studied in our simulations can produce cool
jets with sizes and time scales consistent with observations.

magnetic moment (persistent current) m of the many-body ground state and first

disorder can only be caused by inter-ring charge fluctuations, controllable by
a gate voltage. The oscillation period of m is proportional to 1/(A_1 + A_2) if

superconductor in high magnetic fields within a mean-field BCS theory. We
predict two new features in the corresponding attenuation signal as compared to
that of the Meissner state. Our analytical calculations predict the existence
of oscillations in the attenuation as the external magnetic field is varied-
this effect is associated with the Landau level structure of the electron
states and is analogous to the well-known de Haas van Alphen oscillations in
the mixed state. The attenuation directly probes the quasiparticle energies;
the presence of gapless points in the quasiparticle spectrum, which is
characteristic of type-II superconductors at high magnetic fields, shows up in
the frequency and temperature dependence of the attenuation in the limit of low
frequency and low temperature respectively. At low temperature there is no
analogue to the discontinuity in the attenuation observed in the Meissner state
when $\hbar\omega=\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the quasiparticle gap and
$=\omega$ is the frequency. This result opens up the possibility of
experimentally determining the existence and nature of the gapless points in
the quasiparticle spectrum of a type-II superconductor in high magnetic fields.

early 1980's that cosmic ray neutrinos with energy within $\delta
E/E_R=\Gamma_Z/M_Z \sim 3%$ of the peak energy $E_R=4 (eV/m_{\nu})\times
10^{21}$ eV will annihilate on the nonrelativistic relic antineutrinos (and
vice versa) to produce the Z-boson with an enhanced, resonant cross section of
${\cal O}(G_F)\sim 10^{-32}{cm}^2$. The result of the resonant neutrino
annihilation is a hadronic Z-burst 70% of the time, which contains, on average,
thirty photons and 2.7 nucleons with energies near or above the GZK cutoff
energy of $5\times 10^{19}$ eV. These photons and nucleons produced within our
Supergalactic halo may easily propagate to earth and initiate super-GZK air
showers. Here we show that the probability for each neutrino flavor at its
resonant energy to annihilate within the halo of our Supergalactic cluster is
likely within an order of magnitude of 1%, with the exact value depending on
unknown aspects of neutrino mixing and relic neutrino clustering. The absolute
lower bound in a hot Big Bang universe for the probability to annihilate within
a 50 Mpc radius (roughly a nucleon propagation distance) of earth is 0.036%.
  From fragmentation data for Z-decay, we estimate that the nucleons are more
energetic than the photons by a factor $\sim 10$. Several tests of the
hypothesis are indicated.

In the simplest case a $W + 2$-jet event can be produced by a quark-antiquark
annihilation into $W$ and a 2-jet event occurring in the same proton-antiproton
interaction. We compute that this happens at the 10% level of the higher-order

$p_T$ values of order $5{\sim}10$ GeV, multiple-parton interactions dominate
higher-order QCD-processes. The emergence of this new source of $W + n$-jet

imperative to remove these processes from the event sample in order to extract
information on the strong coupling constant. Also, BFKL studies of low-$p_T$

gaining useful insight into general features of pairing. We first focus on the

methods nor fermion-pair approximations are able to describe in detail
neutron-proton pairing in this model. The analysis suggests, however, that the
boson Hamiltonian obtained from a mapping of the fermion Hamiltonian contains a
pairing force between bosons, pointing to the importance of boson-boson (or
equivalently four-fermion) correlations with isospin T=0 and spin S=0. These
correlations are investigated by carrying out a second boson mapping. Closed
forms for the fermion wave functions are given in terms of the fermion-pair
operators. Similar techniques are applied -- albeit in less detail -- to the

the differential Schr\""{o}dinger equation, we reduce an infinite set of linear
equations to a finite one. Application to the benchmark collinear $H + H_2 \to
H_2 + H$ reaction is shown to yield precise reaction probabilities.

making an analogy with the GNS construction in $C^*$-algebras. The method is
illustrated with examples of semisimple and non-semisimple finite dimensional
Lie algebras as well as loop and Kac-Moody algebras.
  A deformed addition on the parameter space is also introduced simplifying
some expressions and some applications to conformal field theory is pointed
out, e.g. are differential operator and free field realisations found.

remote parties, but it can reduce the communication needed for some problems.
Let each of k parties hold some partial input data to some fixed k-variable
function f. The communication complexity of f is the minimum number of
classical bits required to be broadcasted for every party to know the value of
f on their inputs.
  We construct a function G such that for the one-round communication model and
three parties, G can be computed with n+1 bits of communication when the
parties share prior entanglement. We then show that without entangled
particles, the one-round communication complexity of G is (3/2)n + 1. Next we
generalize this function to a function F. We show that if the parties share
prior quantum entanglement, then the communication complexity of F is exactly
k. We also show that if no entangled particles are provided, then the
communication complexity of F is roughly k*log(k).
  These two results prove for the first time communication complexity
separations better than a constant number of bits.

the unifying structures underlying such diverse models. Variety of ultralocal
and nonultralocal models is shown to be described by a few basic relations
defining novel algebraic entries. Such properties can generate and classify
integrable models systematically and also help to solve exactly their
eigenvalue problem in an almost model-independent way. The unifying thread
stretches also beyond the QIS to establish its deep connections with
statistical models, conformal field theory etc. as well as with abstract
mathematical objects like quantum group, braided or quadratic algebra
