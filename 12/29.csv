with a thermal spectrum, as due to the presence of hot intracluster gas or

be present in the MECS spectrum at energies larger than 7 keV, while for a
fourth object a high energy flux has been detected in the PDS instrument at
energies larger than 15 keV. This component could be related to the inner AGN

universe is currently limited to the starlight which directly escapes from
high-redshift galaxies, since we so far ignore the fraction of luminosity
absorbed by dust and released in the IR/submm wavelength range. A new
constraint is set by the possible detection of the Cosmic Infrared Background.
We briefly review the observations and use a semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation and evolution to predict number counts consistent with the level of
the background. It turns out that the predictions fairly accomodate preliminary
data at 175 and 850 microns. This suggests that a significant fraction of
star/galaxy formation at high z is hidden by dust.

and apparently complex Fe K alpha emission is observed. We consider various
origins for the line but focus on the pros and cons for line emitting accretion
disk models. We develop a simple model of an illuminated disk capable of
producing both X-ray and optical lines from a disk. The model is able to
reproduce the observed Fe K alpha FWHM ratio as well as the radii of maximum
emissivity implied by the profile redshifts. The overall profile shapes however
do not fit well the predictions of our disk illumination model nor do we derive
always consistent disk inclinations for the two lines. We conclude that the
evidence for and against an accretion disk origin for the Fe K alpha emission
is equal at best. The bulk of the data requires a very disparate set of line
fits which shed little light on a coherent physical model. We briefly consider
alternatives to disk emission models and show that a simple bicone model can
reproduce the FE line profiles equally well.

nonlinear term in the Navier-Stokes equation, the invariance of the energy

length scales is taken to be inverse to that in the theory of critical

different from Ostrogradski's one is discussed for the Lagrangian L depending
on first and second order drivatives of the position variable q. We add a
suitable divergence to L. Contrary to other approaches no constraint is needed.

gauge interactions of massive matter fields in 2+1 dimensional space-time and
explain some properties of the deformed oscillator algebra which underlies this
formulation. In particular we show that the parameter of mass $M$ of matter
fields is related to the deformation parameter in this algebra.

intrinsic in the Gupta-Bleuler quantization method for the specific case of
mixed first and second class fermionic constraints in an arbitrary space-time

explicit solution for d=10 is presented.
