velocities of celestial objects, so can the relativistic Doppler effect be
implemented to measure a combination of radial and transverse velocities by
using recent improvements in observing techniques. A key element that makes a
further use of this combination feasible is the periodicity in changes of the
orbital velocity direction for the source. Two cases are considered: (i) a
binary star; and (ii) a solitary star with the planetary companion. It is shown
that, in case (i), several precision Doppler measurements employing the gas
absorption cell technique would determine both the total orbital velocity and
the inclination angle of the binary orbit disentangled from the peculiar
velocity of the system. The necessary condition for that is the measured, at
least with a modest precision, proper motion and distance to the system.

monitor for transient radio emission at 611 MHz on timescales of fractions of a
second to minutes. Consisting of multiple geographically separated total-power
radiometers which measure the sky power every 0.125 sec, STARE has been in
operation since March 1996. In its first seventeen months of operation, STARE
collected data before, during, and after 173 gamma-ray bursts. Seven candidate
astronomical radio bursts were detected within +/-1hr of a GRB, consistent with
the rate of chance coincidences expected from the local radio interference
rates. The STARE data are therefore consistent with an absence of radio
counterparts appearing within +/-1hr of GRBs, with 5sigma detection limits
ranging from tens to hundreds of kJy. The strengths of STARE relative to other
radio counterpart detection efforts are its large solid-angle and temporal
coverage. These result in a large number of GRBs occuring in the STARE field of
view, allowing studies that are statistical in nature. Such a broad approach
may also be valuable if the GRBs are due to a heterogenous set of sources.

and spectral evolution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We align the temporal
structure of each burst by setting its duration to a standard duration, which
we call T_<Dur>. The observed average ``aligned $T_<Dur>'' profile for 32
bright bursts with intermediate durations (16 to 40 s) has a sharp rise (within
the first 20% of T_<Dur>) and then a linear decay. Exponentials and power laws
do not fit this decay. In particular, the power law seen in the x-ray afterglow
(T^{-1.4}) is not observed during the bursts, implying that the x-ray afterglow
is not just an extension of the x-ray evolution seen during the gamma-ray
phase. The average burst spectrum has a low energy slope of -1.03, a high
energy slope of -3.31, and a peak in the \nu F_{\nu} distribution at 390 keV.
We determine the average spectral evolution. Remarkably, it is also a linear
function, with the peak of the \nu F_{\nu} distribution given by 680 - 600
(T/T_<Dur>) keV. Since both the temporal profile and the peak energy are linear
functions, the peak energy is linearly proportional to the intensity. This
behavior is inconsistent with the external shock model. Previously, trends have
been reported for GRB evolution, but our results are quantitative relationships
that models should attempt to explain.

some evidence for a strong rolloff at lower energies in a few events. There is
a correlation (Pearson's r = -0.62) between the low energy slope and the bend
energy. We find that the distribution of spectral bend energies extends below
10 keV. There has been some concern in cosmological models of GRBs that the
bend energy covers only a small dynamic range. Our result extends the observed
dynamic range and, since we observe bend energies down to the limit of our
instrument, perhaps observations have not yet limited the range. The Ginga
trigger range was virtually the same as BATSE's, yet we find a different range
of fit parameters. One possible explanation might be that GRBs have two break
energies, one often in the 50 to 500 keV range and the other near 5 keV. Both
BATSE and Ginga fit with only a single break energy so BATSE tends to find
breaks near the center of its energy range and we tend to find breaks in our
energy range. The observed ratio of energy emitted in the x-rays relative to
the gamma-rays can be much larger than a few percent and, in fact, is sometimes
larger than unity. The average for our 22 bursts is 24%. There is one example
of a strong x-ray excess at low energy.

between two absorbing states saturated by each different species. Increasing
the repulsion, a reactive stationary state appears in addition to the saturated
states. The irreversible phase transitions from the reactive phase to any of
the saturated states are continuous and belong to the directed percolation
universality class. However, a different critical behavior is found at the
point where the directed percolation phase boundaries meet. The values of the
critical exponents calculated at the bicritical point are in good agreement
with the exponents corresponding to the parity-conserving universality class.
Since the adsorption-reaction processes does not lead to a non-trivial local

between absorbing states plays a relevant role in determining the universality
class. The value of the exponent $\delta_2$, which characterizes the
fluctuations of an interface at the bicritical point, supports the
Bassler-Brown's conjecture which states that this is a new exponent in the

$\phi^{(p+1)}$ mediates the interaction between $p$-branes, which is gauge
invariant in the sense $\phi^{(p+1)}\to \phi^{(p+1)}+d\Lambda^{(p)}$ with
$\Lambda^{(p)}$, an arbitrary $p$-form and $d$, a boundary operator. We, on the

oscillator with an arbitrary time-dependent frequency. Here our result is a
generalization of Gel'fand-Yaglom's famous formula which was restricted to
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Apart from the generalization, our derivation is
more transparent than theirs, the determinants requiring only knowledge of the
classical trajectories. Special properties of operators with a zero mode are
exhibited. Our technique does not require the calculation of the spectrum and
is as simple as Wronski's method for Green functions.

accuracy, but its extrapolation to very high-energy phenomena is much less well
established. Lorentz symmetry can be broken at Planck scale due to the
renormalization of gravity or to some deeper structure of matter: we expect
such a breaking to be a very high energy and very short distance phenomenon. If
textbook special relativity is only an approximate property of the equations
describing a sector of matter above some critical distance scale, an absolute
local frame (the ""vacuum rest frame"", VRF) can possibly be found and
superluminal sectors of matter may exist related to new degrees of freedom not
yet discovered experimentally. The new superluminal particles (""superbradyons"",
i.e. bradyons with superluminal critical speed) would have positive mass and
energy, and behave kinematically like ""ordinary"" particles (those with critical
speed in vacuum equal to c, the speed of light) apart from the difference in
critical speed (c_i >> c where c_i is the critical speed of a superluminal
sector). They may be the ultimate building blocks of matter At speed v > c,
they are expected to release ""Cherenkov"" radiation (""ordinary"" particles) in
vacuum. Superluminal particles could provide most of the cosmic (dark) matter
and produce very high-energy cosmic rays. We discuss: a) the possible relevance
of superluminal matter to the composition, sources and spectra of high-energy
cosmic rays; b) signatures and experiments allowing to possibly explore such
effects. Very large volume and unprecedented background rejection ability are
crucial requirements for any detector devoted to the search for cosmic
superbradyons. Future cosmic-ray experiments using air-shower detectors
(especially from space) naturally fulfil both requirements.
