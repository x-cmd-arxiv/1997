  We introduce the notions of ${\cal L}$-primitive varieties and ${\cal

propose a method to define an adelic Tamagawa number $\tau_{\cal L}(V)$ which
is a generalization of the Tamagawa number $\tau(V)$ introduced by Peyre for
smooth Fano varieties. Our method allows us to construct Tamagawa numbers for
$Q$-Fano varieties with at worst canonical singularities. In a series of
examples of smooth polarized varieties and singular Fano varieties we show that
our Tamagawa numbers express the dependence of the asymptotic of $N(V,{\cal

star-forming galaxies, since our sample of 221 emission-line regions includes
82% nuclear or extranuclear starbursts. The contamination by Seyferts is low
(9%). The remaining galaxies (9%) are objects with ambiguous classification
(HII or LINER). The dust content and Halpha luminosity increase towards the
nuclei of the galaxies. No significant variation of the electron density is
found between nuclear and bar HII regions. However, the mean Halpha luminosity
and electron density in the bar are higher than in typical disk HII regions. We
investigate different mechanisms for explaining the excess of nitrogen emission
observed in our starburst nuclei. There is no evidence for the presence of a
weak hidden active galactic nucleus in our starburst galaxies. The cause of
this excess is probably a selective enrichment of nitrogen in the nuclei of the
galaxies, following a succession of short and intense bursts of star formation.
Our sample of SBNGs, located at a mean redshift of 0.015, has moderate Halpha
(10^41 erg/s) and far infrared (10^10 Lsun) luminosities. The types are
distributed equally among early- and late-type giant spirals with a slight
preference for Sbc/Sc types because of their barred morphology. The majority
(62%) of SBNGs are isolated with no sign of gravitational interaction. In terms
of distance, luminosity and level of interaction, SBNGs are intermediate
between HII galaxies and luminous infrared galaxies.

perturbation theory. The accuracy of the latter is found to be much higher than

propagate in a non-homogeneous flowing fluid. This question can be answered by
invoking the language of Lorentzian differential geometry: If the fluid is
barotropic and inviscid, and the flow is irrotational (though possibly time
dependent), then the equation of motion for the velocity potential describing a
sound wave is identical to that for a minimally coupled massless scalar field
propagating in a (3+1)-dimensional Lorentzian geometry. The acoustic metric
governing the propagation of sound depends algebraically on the density, flow
velocity, and local speed of sound. This rather simple physical system is the
basis underlying a deep and fruitful analogy between the black holes of
Einstein gravity and supersonic fluid flows. Many results and definitions can
be carried over directly from one system to another. For example, I will show
how to define the ergosphere, trapped regions, acoustic apparent horizon, and
acoustic event horizon for a supersonic fluid flow, and will exhibit the close
relationship between the acoustic metric for the fluid flow surrounding a point
sink and the Painleve-Gullstrand form of the Schwarzschild metric for a black

to a complete nonequilibrium quantum kinetic theory. In this paper we make use
of the CTP formalism to write down a set of quantum Boltzmann equations
describing the local number density asymmetries of the particles involved in
supersymmetric electroweak baryogenesis. These diffusion equations
automatically and self-consistently incorporate the CP-violating sources which
fuel baryogenesis when transport properties allow the CP-violating charges to
diffuse in front of the bubble wall separating the broken from the unbroken
phase at the electroweak phase transition. This is a significant improvement
with respect to recent approaches where the CP-violating sources are inserted
by hand into the diffusion equations. Furthermore, the CP-violating sources and
the particle number changing interactions manifest ``memory'' effects which are
typical of the quantum transp ort theory and are not present in the classical
approach. The slowdown of the relaxation processes may keep the system out of
equilibrium for longer times and therefore enhance the final baryon asymmetry.
We also stress that the classical approximation is not adequate to describe the
quantum interference nature of CP-violation and that a quantum approach should
be adopted to compute the sources since they are most easily built up by the
transmission of low momentum particles.

conjectured M-theory dualities, open strings play a prominent role. We review
the construction of open-string descendants (un-orientifolds) of closed-string
theories admitting a generalized orientation reversal involution. We then
specialize the construction to some classes of non-supersymmetric models in
D=10 that have been recently considered in the context of duality without
supersymmetry. We also discuss the propagation of open and unoriented strings
on the NS pentabrane (N5-brane). This background is a prototype of the
configurations of branes and orientifold planes that represent a powerful
alternative to the geometric engineering of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories.
The resulting description of D-branes in non-trivial backgrounds looks very
different from the one naively expected. In particular the very distinction
between different Dp-branes becomes ambiguous in the presence of strong
curvature effects.

set theory if rank(F) is an infinite cardinal greater than the power of the

negative; one such an example, the variety of all algebras in empty language,

Simulation is a useful tool for determining the feasibility of quantum
computers in the presence of errors. The size of a quantum computer that can be
simulat ed is small because faithfully modeling a quantum computer requires an
exponential amount of storage and number of operations. In this paper we define
simulation models to study the feasibility of quantum computers. The most
detailed of these models is based directly on a proposed imple mentation. We
also define less detailed models which are exponentially less complex but still
pro duce accurate results. Finally we show that the two different types of
