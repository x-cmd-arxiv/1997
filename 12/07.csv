filters B_450, V_606 & I_814 - as well as in redshifted Lya - of the radio
source LBDS 53W002, a compact narrow-line galaxy at z=2.390. These images allow
us to distinguish several morphological components: (1) an unresolved nuclear
point source (<=500 pc at z=2.390 for Ho=75, qo=0), likely the central AGN
which contains <=20-25% of the total light in BVI; (2) a compact continuum core
(re~0.05""); (3) a more extended envelope with an r^1/4-like light-profile and
re~0.25"" (~2 kpc); (4) two blue ''clouds'' roughly colinear across the nucleus
aligned with the radio source axis and contained well within the size of the
radio source. (B-I) color maps may suggest a narrow dust lane crossing between
the nucleus and the smaller blue cloud. The radio source is not smaller than
the distance between the blue continuum clouds, and coincides with a bright Lya
''arc'' in the western cloud, suggesting that jet-induced star-formation could
cause both blue clouds, except the outer parts of the western cloud. The shape
of this larger blue cloud suggests reflected AGN continuum-light shining
through a cone (plus re-radiated Lya in emission). The OVRO interferometric
CO-detection (Scoville et al. 1997) on both sides of 53W002 - and in the same
direction as the continuum clouds and the radio jet - also suggest a
star-bursting region induced by its radio jet, at least in the inner parts.
Even at radio powers ~1.5 dex fainter than the 3CR sources, we thus find many
of the same aligned features and complex morphology, although at much smaller
angular scales and lower optical-UV luminosities. We discuss the consequences
for 53W002's formation in the context of the 16 sub-galactic objects at z~2.40
around 53W002 (Pascarelle et al. 1996).

1997b). The lack of a Lyman-alpha forest in these spectra further constrains
this redshift to be less than approximately 2.3. I show that the spectrum of
the optical afterglow of GRB 970508, once corrected for Galactic absorption, is
inconsistent with the relativistic blast-wave model unless a second, redshifted
source of extinction is introduced. This second source of extinction may be the
yet unobserved host galaxy. I determine its redshift to be z =
1.09^{+0.14}_{-0.41}, which is consistent with the observed redshift of z =
0.835. Redshifts greater than z = 1.40 are ruled out at the 3 sigma confidence

investigate the spatial distribution of SiO maser sources, we have also
observed the offset positions by +- 40"" in Galactic longitude from the Galactic

nearly constant at the Galactic center. The number density of SiO maser sources
is found to be an order of magnitude higher than the density of OH 1612 MHz

suggested in some approaches to quantum gravity. A simple estimate shows that
GRB measurements might be sensitive to a dispersion scale $E_{QG}$ comparable

galaxies (BCGs) in a sample of X-ray clusters covering the redshift range
$0.05<z<0.8$. We show that BCGs in clusters of high X-ray luminosity are
excellent standard candles: the intrinsic dispersion in the raw K band absolute
magnitudes of BCGs in clusters with $L_{\rm X} > 2.3 \times 10^{44}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ (in the 0.3 - 3.5 keV band) is no more than 0.22 mag, and is not
significantly reduced by correcting for the BCG structure parameter, $\alpha$,
or for X-ray luminosity. This is the smallest scatter in the absolute
magnitudes of any single class of galaxy and demonstrates the homogeneity of
BCGs in high-$L_{\rm X}$ clusters. By contrast, we find that the brightest
members of low-$L_{\rm X}$ systems display a wider dispersion ($\sim 0.5$ mag)
in absolute magnitude than commonly seen in previous studies, which arises from
the inclusion, in X-ray flux-limited samples, of poor clusters and groups which
are usually omitted from low redshift studies of BCGs in optically rich
clusters....[abstract shortened].. The BCGs in our high-$L_{\rm X}$ clusters
yield a value of $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.28\pm0.24$ if the cosmological constant
$\Lambda=0$. For a flat Universe we find $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.55^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$
with a 95 per cent confidence upper limit to the cosmological constant
corresponding to $\Omega_{\Lambda}<0.73$. These results are discussed in the
context of other methods used to constrain the density of the Universe, such as
Type Ia supernovae.

shown that the commutation relations between the fields are trivial at any

that they vanish at the tree level. In the second part of the talk the

Bethe-Salpeter equation for the three-particle propagator (six-point function)
is obtained. Using the one-boson-exchange form of the kernel, this equation is
then analyzed using time-ordered perturbation theory, and a three-dimensional
equation for the propagator is developed. The propagator consists of a
pre-factor in which the relative energies are fixed by the initial state of the
particles, an intermediate part in which only global propagation of the
particles occurs, and a post-factor in which relative energies are fixed by the
final state of the particles. The pre- and post-factors are necessary in order
to account for the transition from states where particles are off their mass
shell to states described by the global propagator with all of the particle
energies on shell. The pole structure of the intermediate part of the
propagator is used to determine the equation for the three-body bound state: a
Schr{\""o}dinger-like relativistic equation with a single, global Green's
function. The role of the pre- and post-factors in the relativistic dynamics is
to incorporate the poles of the breakup channels in the initial and final
states. The derivation of this equation by integrating over the relative times
rather than via a constraint on relative momenta allows the inclusion of
retardation and dynamical boost corrections without introducing unphysical
