z=4.04 galaxy (Frye & Broadhurst 1998). This is lensed by the rich foreground
cluster Abell 2390 (z=0.23) into highly-magnified arcs 3-5"" in length. Our H-
and K'-band Keck/NIRC imaging allows us to map the Balmer+4000Ang break
amplitude. In combination with high-quality archival HST/WFPC2 data, we can
spatially resolve stellar populations along the arcs. The WFPC2 images clearly
reveal several bright knots, which may correspond to sites of active star
formation. Indeed, in some spatial regions the Keck/LRIS discovery spectra are
consistent with OB-star spectral energy distributions in the rest-ultraviolet.
However, there are considerable portions of the arcs which appear redder with
no Ly-alpha emission, consistent with being post-starburst regions.

  Proc. of the 8th Annual Astrophysics Conference in Maryland, S. S. Holt & T.
  Kallman (eds.)",,"10.1063/1.55924",,"astro-ph",,"  We present further observational evidence of the effects of a centrifugal
barrier in GRO J1744-28, based on continued monitoring of the source with RXTE.
For X-ray pulsars, the centrifugal barrier manifests itself in the cessation of
pulsed emission when the source becomes faint. We show that such phenomenon
occurred repeatedly for GRO J1744-28, following the decay of two X-ray
outbursts. This has allowed a direct measurement of the dipole field strength
for this pulsar. Here we argue that some of the other peculiar properties
observed of this source may also be related to an active centrifugal barrier.

asymptotic limiting functions $W(\{G_s\},q)=\lim_{n \to \infty}P(G_s,q)^{1/n}$
for families of $n$-vertex graphs $(G_s)_m$ comprised of $m$ repeated subgraphs
$H$ adjoined to an initial graph $I$. These calculations of $W(\{G_s\},q)$ for
infinitely long strips of varying widths yield important insights into
properties of $W(\Lambda,q)$ for two-dimensional lattices $\Lambda$. In turn,
these results connect with statistical mechanics, since $W(\Lambda,q)$ is the
ground state degeneracy of the $q$-state Potts model on the lattice $\Lambda$.
For our calculations, we develop and use a generating function method, which
enables us to determine both the chromatic polynomials of finite strip graphs
and the resultant $W(\{G_s\},q)$ function in the limit $n \to \infty$. From
this, we obtain the exact continuous locus of points ${\cal B}$ where
$W(\{G_s\},q)$ is nonanalytic in the complex $q$ plane. This locus is shown to
consist of arcs which do not separate the $q$ plane into disconnected regions.
Zeros of chromatic polynomials are computed for finite strips and compared with
the exact locus of singularities ${\cal B}$. We find that as the width of the
infinitely long strips is increased, the arcs comprising ${\cal B}$ elongate
and move toward each other, which enables one to understand the origin of
closed regions that result for the (infinite) 2D lattice.

bosons such as liquid $^4He$.Each particle in the system represents a $(q;-q)$
pair moving with a centre of mass momentum K.Particles form bound pairs below
$\lambda$-point and have a kind of collection binding between them.The binding
is idenified as an energy gap between the superfluid and the normal states of
the system.The $\lambda$-transition is a consequence of interparticle quantum
correlations.It follows an order-disoder of particles in their phase structure
as well as the onset of Bose_ Einstein condensatin in the state of $q={\pi}/d$
and K=0.In addition to the well known modes of collective motion such as
photons,rotons, maxons etc.,the superfluid state also exhibits a new kind of
quasi-particle,omon,characterised by a phononlike wave of the oscillations of
the momentum coordinates of the particle.The theory explains the properties of
$He-II$ at quantitative level and vindicates the two-fluid theory of Landau.The
paper finally describes the way this theory could help in understanding the
superfluidity of 1-D and 2-D systems.It also analyses the possibility of
applying this approach to develop similar framework for a fermion system
including an atomic nucleus.

finiteness properties of mapping class groups of 2-manifolds of finite type.
For example, H(M) has a torsionfree subgroup of finite index, which is
geometrically finite (i. e. is the fundamental group of a finite aspherical
complex). This was proven by J. Harer for 2-manifolds and by the second author
for Haken 3-manifolds. In this paper we prove that H(M) acts properly
discontinuously on a contractible simplicial complex, with compact quotient.
This implies that every torsionfree subgroup of finite index in H(M) is
geometrically finite. Also, a simplified proof of the fact that torsionfree
subgroups of finite index in H(M) exist is given. All results are proven for
mapping class groups that preserve a boundary pattern in the sense of K.

order, introduced in the functional space R{W(t)}, the variables in original
equation are separated. The general measure in the space R{W(t)} of the
Fokker-Plank type is obtained and expression for total wave function (wave

stochastic basis set. The pertinent transition matrix S_br is constructed. For
Wiener type measure W(t) of functional space the exact representation for
