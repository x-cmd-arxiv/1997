  According to our model, penumbral grains are the manifestation of the
footpoints of magnetic flux tubes, along which hot subphotospheric plasma flows
upwards with a few km/s. Above the photosphere the hot plasma inside the tube
is cooled by radiative losses as it flows horizontally outwards. As long as the
flowing plasma is hotter than the surroundings, it constitutes a bright radial
filament. The flow confined to a thin elevated channel reaches the temperature
equilibrium with the surrounding atmosphere and becomes optically thin near the
outer edge of the penumbra.
  Here, the tube has a height of approximately 100 km above the continuum and
the flow velocity reaches up to 14 km/s. Such a flow channel can reproduce the
observed signatures of the Evershed effect.

and red intensities of the radiation from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM)
and examined the red intensity for the presence of an excess above that
expected for scattered light. The diffuse ISM blue and red intensities were
obtained by subtracting the integrated star and galaxy intensities from the
blue and red measurements made by the Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) aboard the
Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. The color of the diffuse ISM was found to be
redder than the Pioneer intensities, contrary to that expected for scattered
light (Diffuse Galactic Light [DGL]). The red DGL was calculated using the blue
diffuse ISM intensities and the approximately invariant color of the DGL
calculated with the DGL model. Subtracting the calculated red DGL from the red
diffuse ISM intensities resulted in the detection of an excess red intensity.
This represents the likely detection of ERE in the diffuse ISM since H-alpha
emission cannot account for the strength of this excess and the only other
known emission process applicable to the diffuse ISM is ERE. Thus, ERE appears
to be a general characteristic of dust. From the correlation between N_HI and

as post-starburst galaxies in which the star formation ceased within the last
Gyr. This transition between a star forming and non-star forming state is a
critical link in any galaxy evolution model in which a blue, star forming disk
galaxy evolves into a S0 or elliptical. Another possible evolutionary track is
that the star formation in an ``E+A'' resumes at some later time, if enough gas
remains in the galaxy after its starburst ends. Given this ambiguity, it is
important to investigate (1) the environment's role in ``E+A'' evolution, (2)
the stellar and gas morphologies of ``E+A''s, (3) the likely progenitors of
``E+A''s, and (4) how common the ``E+A'' phase is in the evolution of galaxies.

regions. The multi-frequency spectra were used to study the synchrotron ageing
of relativistic electrons with increasing distance from the active nucleus. We
found that the spectrum in each radio galaxy progressively steepens with
distance, and at each location it is steeper at high frequencies. The spectra
are fitted by models involving synchrotron energy losses and the critical
frequency is obtained at increasing distance from the core. Assuming that the
magnetic field is the equipartition value, we obtain the radiating electron
lifetimes and consequently their drift velocities. Our results imply the
existence of reacceleration processes or bulk motions along the tails. The

several (up to 4 - 6) orders of magnitude, and the event rate increased
correspondingly. The large Lorentz factors (Gamma > 100) inferred from GRB
spectra imply relativistic beaming of the gamma rays into an angle 1/Gamma. We
are at present ignorant of whether there are ejecta outside this narrow cone.
  Afterglows allow empirical tests of whether GRBs are well-collimated jets or
spherical fireballs. The bulk Lorentz factor decreases and radiation is beamed
into an ever increasing solid angle as the burst remnant expands. It follows
that if gamma ray bursts are highly collimated, many more optical and radio
transients should be observed without associated gamma rays than with them.
  In addition, a burst whose ejecta are beamed into angle zeta undergoes a
qualitative change in evolution when Gamma < 1/zeta: Before this, Gamma ~
r^{-3/2}, while afterwards, Gamma decays exponentially with r. This change
results in a potentially observable break in the afterglow light curve.

kinetic Ising ferromagnet in an oscillating field, using Monte Carlo
simulations and analytical theory. Attention is focused on small systems and
weak field amplitudes at a temperature below $T_{c}$. For these restricted
parameters, the magnetization switches through random nucleation of a single
droplet of spins aligned with the applied field. We analyze the stochastic
hysteresis observed in this parameter regime, using time-dependent nucleation
theory and the theory of variable-rate Markov processes. The theory enables us
to accurately predict the results of extensive Monte Carlo simulations, without
the use of any adjustable parameters. The stochastic response is qualitatively
different from what is observed, either in mean-field models or in simulations
of larger spatially extended systems. We consider the frequency dependence of
the probability density for the hysteresis-loop area and show that its average
slowly crosses over to a logarithmic decay with frequency and amplitude for
asymptotically low frequencies. Both the average loop area and the
residence-time distributions for the magnetization show evidence of stochastic
resonance. We also demonstrate a connection between the residence-time
distributions and the power spectral densities of the magnetization time
series. In addition to their significance for the interpretation of recent
experiments in condensed-matter physics, including studies of switching in
ferromagnetic and ferroelectric nanoparticles and ultrathin films, our results
are relevant to the general theory of periodically driven arrays of coupled,
bistable systems with stochastic noise.

quantum of action, obtained by scaling the Planck constant, is close to the
Kerr limit for the spin of the universe -- when this is considered as a huge
rotating black-hole -- and to the spin of Godel's universe, solution of
Einstein equations of gravitation. Besides, we suggest the existence of
another, intermediate, scale invariance, with scale factor $\lambda \sim

gravitational radius and for the collapse proper-time of a typical black-hole,

relations implied by the two referred scale transformations are in accordance
with Muradian's Regge-like relations for galaxy clusters and stars. Impressive

effect that is generic to Lorentzian geometries. Hawking radiation arises for
any test field on any Lorentzian geometry containing an event horizon
regardless of whether or not the Lorentzian geometry satisfies the dynamical
Einstein equations of general relativity. On the other hand, the classical laws
of black hole mechanics are intrinsically linked to the Einstein equations of
general relativity (or their perturbative extension into either semiclassical
quantum gravity or string-inspired scenarios). In particular, the laws of black
hole thermodynamics, and the identification of the entropy of a black hole with
its area, are inextricably linked with the dynamical equations satisfied by the
Lorentzian geometry: entropy is proportional to area (plus corrections) if and
only if the dynamical equations are the Einstein equations (plus corrections).
It is quite possible to have Hawking radiation occur in physical situations in
which the laws of black hole mechanics do not apply, and in situations in which
the notion of black hole entropy does not even make any sense. This observation
has important implications for any derivation of black hole entropy that seeks
to deduce black hole entropy from the Hawking radiation.

to place strong limits on the possible contribution of these sources to the

of QCD Sum Rules (QCDSR) to the analysis of (quenched) lattice correlation

well as baryons; we analyse data from several lattice spacings; and we include
data from the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert (clover) improved action. We find that the
QCDSR Continuum Model Ansatz can reproduce the data, but only for non-physical
values of its parameters. This leads us to reject it as a model for hadronic
correlation functions.
  We study the non-relativistic quark model and conclude that it predicts
essentially the same form for the correlation function as the QCDSR Continuum
Model approach. Furthermore, because it doesn't have the Continuum Model's
restrictions on the parameters, the non-relativistic quark model can be viewed
as a successful Ansatz.
  As well as studying the validity or otherwise of the QCDSR Continuum Model
approach, this paper defines 4-parameter fitting functions that can be used to
fit lattice data even for a time window close to the source. These functions
are shown to be an improvement over 2-exponential fits especially in the case
of mesons. We encourage the application of this approach to situations where
the conventional fitting procedures are problematic due to poor ground state
dominance.

Feigin. Let $\frak u_\ell$ be the small quantum group a the primitive $\ell$-th
root of unity. Then it is known that the usual $Ext$ algebra of the trivial
$\frak u_\ell$-module is isomorphic to the algebra of regular functions on the
nilpotent variety $\cal N$ in the corresponding simple Lie algebra $\frak g$
(see [GK]). Consider semiinfinite cohomology of the trivial $\frak
u_\ell$-module introduced in [Ar1], [Ar2]. It was shown in [Ar2] that the $Ext$
algebra of the trivial $\frak u_\ell$-module acts naturally on semiinfinite
cohomology. Moreover semiinfinite cohomology space of the trivial
$\frak_\ell$-module is equipped with a natural $\frak g$-module structure. B.
Feigin conjectured that the described $\frak g$-module and $F(\cal N)$-module
structures coincide with the ones on the space of local cohomology of the
structure sheaf on $\cal N$ with support in the standard positive nilpotent
subalgebra $\frak n^+\subset\cal N\subset \frak g$. We give a detailed proof of
the conjecture. Moreover we generalize the statement and describe semiinfinite
cohomology of contragradient Weyl modules in terms of local cohomology of
certain coherent sheaves on the nilpotent cone and on its desingularization
$T^*(G/B)$. To do this we construct a certain specialization of the quantum BGG
resolution of the simple module $L(\lambda)$ defined for generic values of the
quantizing parameter into the root of unity called the quasi-BGG complex. The
complex conists of direct sums of quasi-Verma modules and provides
conjecturally a resolution of the Weyl module $W(\lambda)$.

ample family of integrable mechanical systems associated to hyperelliptic
curves. We prove that derivative of the Abel-Jacobi map is just the St\""{a}ckel
matrix, which determines $n$-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems in a
flat space. The Lax pairs, $r$-matrix algebras and explicit form of the flat
coordinates are constructed. An application of the Weierstrass reduction theory
allows to construct several flat coordinate systems on a common hyperelliptic
curve and to connect among themselves different integrable systems on a single
phase space.

related to the classical series of simple Lie algebras are classified. It is
shown that the CTC models have much richer variety of asymptotic regimes than
the real Toda chain (RTC). Besides asymptotically free propagation (the only
possible regime for the RTC), CTC allow bound state regimes, various
intermediate regimes when one (or several) group(s) of particles form bound
state(s), singular and degenerate solutions. These results can be used e.g., in
describing the soliton interactions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation.
Explicit expressions for the solutions in terms of minimal sets of scattering
data are proposed for all classical series B_r - D_r.
