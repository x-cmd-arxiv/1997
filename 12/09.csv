Lyman limit absorption system at $z = 3.572$ towards Q1937--1009. We use an
improved method to measure D/H in QSO absorption systems, which includes extra
parameters to treat the continuum uncertainties, a variety of new absorption
models which allow for undetected velocity structure, and the improved
measurement of the total hydrogen column density by Burles & Tytler (1997a). We
find that all models, including contamination, give an upper limit D/H $< 3.9
\times 10^{-5}$ (95 % confidence). Both this and previous analyses find
contamination to be unlikely in this absorption system, A $\chi^2$ analysis in
models without contamination gives D/H $= 3.3 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-5}$ (67%
confidence), which is higher but consistent with the earlier results of Tytler
et al. (1996), and a second measurement of D/H towards Q1009+2956 (Burles &
Tytler 1997). With calculations of standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN) and
the assumption that this measurement of D/H is representative of the primordial
value, we find a high baryon-to-photon ratio, $\eta = 5.3 \pm 0.4 \times
10^{-10}$. This is consistent with primordial abundance determinations of
$^4$He in H II regions (Izotov et al. 1997) and $^7$Li in the atmospheres of
warm metal-poor population II stars (Bonifacio & Molaro 1997). We find a high
value for the present-day baryon density, $\Omega_b h^2 = 0.0193 \pm 0.0014$,
which is consistent with other inventories of baryonic matter, from low to high
redshift: clusters of galaxies, the Lyman alpha forest & the Cosmic Microwave
Background.

  Letters, 8 Dec 1997",,"10.1086/311184",,"astro-ph",,"  We propose that a large fraction of the QSO Lyman limit absorption systems
(LLS) observed at high redshift (z > 3) originate from gas trapped in small
objects, such as minihalos, that form prior to reionization. In the absence of
a strong UV flux, the gas is predominantly neutral and may form clouds with HI
column density NHI > 10^18 cm^-2. Due to their high densities and high HI
column densities, these clouds are not destroyed by the onset of the UV
background at a later time. Thus, if not disrupted by other processes, such as
mergers into larger systems or `blow away' by supernovae, they will produce
LLS. We show that the observed number density of LLS at high redshifts can well
be reproduced by the survived `minihalos' in hierarchical clustering models
such as the standard cold dark matter model. The number density of LLS in such
a population increases with z even beyond the redshifts accessible to current
observations and dies off quickly at z < 2. This population is distinct from
other populations because the absorbing systems have small velocity widths and
a close to primordial chemical composition. The existence of such a population
requires that the reionization of the universe occurs late, at z < 20.

from the extended disk. For such maximal rotation rates, we find that much
before the maximum stable gravitational mass configuration is reached, there
exists a limiting central density, for which particles in the innermost stable

We also calculate the angular velocity profiles of particles in Keplerian

compare the values of the cut-off frequency derived from expressions for the

approximation of an isothermal atmosphere. Kurucz model atmospheres increase
the theoretical acoustic cut-off frequency for roAp stars by about 200 mu$Hz,
which is closer to the observations. We compare our computations with
observations of the 3 roAp stars HD 24712, alphaCir, and HD 134214. For alpha
Cir we find models with Kurucz atmospheres which have indeed a cut-off
frequency beyond the largest observed frequency. For HD 24712 only models which
are hotter by about 100 K and less luminous by nearly 10% than what is actually
the most probable value would have an acoustic cut-off frequency large enough.
One may thus speculate that the old controversy about a mismatch between

  This new system, which we denote `t', differs fundamentally from the `T'
system (of the `Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies' series) in that: (1) it
enables a galaxy's luminosity profile to be extrapolated without the need for
any prior morphological classification, and (2) it is applicable to images of
widely different spatial resolutions (including unresolved ones) because it
takes into account systematic effects due to differential image resolution.
  It also differs fundamentally from the Kron system in that: (1) it can be
derived directly from surface photometry without the need to go back to the
plate scans or CCD frames (unless the surface photometry is of high resolution
and/or the galaxies being measured are very bright), and (2) it can cope with
merged images (provided they are separable by image-segmentation software).

magnitudes with respect to morphological type, the seeing conditions at the

as B -> K pi, K* pi, K rho... and their impact on direct CP violation in these
modes. First we discuss, in general, how the CPT theorem constrains the
resulting pattern of partial rate asymmetries leading to different brands of
direct CP. Traditional discussions have centered around the absorptive part of
the penguin graph which has Delta I=0 in b -> s transitions and as a result
causes ``simple'' CP violation; long-distance final state rescattering effects,
in general, will lead to a different pattern of CP: ``compound'' CP violation.
Predictions of simple CP are quite distinct from that of compound CP. Final
states rescattering phases in B decays are unlikely to be small possibly
causing large compound CP violating partial rate asymmetries in these modes.
CPT theorem requires a cancellation of PRA due to compound CP amongst the
$K\pi$ states themselves; thus there can be no net cancellation with other
states such as K*\pi, K\rho etc. Therefore, each class of such modes, namely K
pi, K rho, K^*pi, K a_1 etc. can have large direct CP emanating from
rescattering effects. Various repercussions for the angle $\gamma$ are also
discussed.

shape-invariance in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This method seems to be
the most direct way to obtain the exact survival probabilities for a number of

The resulting neutrino amplitudes can also be utilized as comparison amplitudes

increases, the charged Higgs boson and light bottom squark masses decrease,
which can potentially increase contributions from $tH^\pm$, $\tg\tb_j$ and

improved $b\to s\gamma$ decay calculation to include in addition the effects of
gluino and neutralino loops. We find that in the mSUGRA model, loops involving
charginos also increase, and dominate over $tW$, $tH^\pm$, $\tg\tq$ and
$\tz_i\tq$ contributions for $\tan\beta\agt 5-10$. We find for large values of
$\tan\beta \sim 35$ that most of the parameter space of the mSUGRA model for
$\mu <0$ is ruled out due to too large a value of branching ratio $B(b\to
s\gamma)$. For $\mu >0$ and large $\tan\beta$, most of parameter space is
allowed, although the regions with the least fine-tuning (low $m_0$ and
$m_{1/2}$) are ruled out due to too low a value of $B(b\to s\gamma)$. We
compare the constraints from $b\to s\gamma$ to constraints from the neutralino
relic density, and to expectations for sparticle discovery at LEP2 and the
Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar p$ colliders. Finally, we show that non-universal GUT
scale soft breaking squark mass terms can enhance gluino loop contributions to

elucidates the mechanism that binds D-particles to an orientifold plane, in
accordance with the predictions of heterotic/type I duality. The ocurrence of
enhanced symmetries associated with massless bound states of a D-particle with
one orientifold plane is illustrated by the enhancement of $SO(14) \times U(1)$

Enhancement to higher-rank groups involves both orientifold planes. For

radius of the heterotic string is seen as the result of two D8-branes
coinciding midway between the orientifold planes, while the enhanced $SU(18)$

waves) is presented that is not restricted to small viscous dissipation. By
using a multiple scale asymptotic expansion near threshold, a standing wave
amplitude equation is derived from the governing equations. The amplitude
equation is of gradient form, and the coefficients of the associated Lyapunov
function are computed for regular patterns of various symmetries as a function
of a viscous damping parameter gamma. For gamma approximately 1, the selected
wave pattern comprises a single standing wave (stripe pattern). For gamma much
less than 1, patterns of square symmetry are obtained in the capillary regime
(large frequencies). At lower frequencies (the mixed gravity-capillary regime),
a sequence of six-fold (hexagonal), eight-fold,... patterns are predicted. For
even lower frequencies (gravity waves) a stripe pattern is again selected. Our
predictions of the stability regions of the various patterns are in
quantitative agreement with recent experiments conducted in large aspect ratio
systems.

this system is endowed with an interesting symplectic structure. We prove that
this structure is strongly non-degenerated and, therefore, enables one to
define consistent Poisson bracket for particle's and field degrees of freedom.

  Version to appear in J. Algebra","J. Algebra, 215:290-317, 1999",,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  For a given entwining structure $(A,C)_\psi$ involving an algebra $A$, a
coalgebra $C$, and an entwining map $\psi: C\otimes A\to A\otimes C$, a
category $\M_A^C(\psi)$ of right $(A,C)_\psi$-modules is defined and its
structure analysed. In particular, the notion of a measuring of $(A,C)_\psi$ to
$(\tA,\tC)_\tpsi$ is introduced, and certain functors between $\M_A^C(\psi)$
and $\M_\tA^\tC(\tpsi)$ induced by such a measuring are defined. It is shown
that these functors are inverse equivalences iff they are exact (or one of them
faithfully exact) and the measuring satisfies a certain Galois-type condition.
Next, left modules $E$ and right modules $\bar{E}$ associated to a $C$-Galois
extension $A$ of $B$ are defined. These can be thought of as objects dual to
fibre bundles with coalgebra $C$ in the place of a structure group, and a fibre
$V$. Cross-sections of such associated modules are defined as module maps $E\to
B$ or $\bar{E}\to B$. It is shown that they can be identified with suitably
equivariant maps from the fibre to $A$. Also, it is shown that a $C$-Galois
extension is cleft if and only if $A=B\tens C$ as left $B$-modules and right
$C$-comodules. The relationship between the modules $E$ and $\bar{E}$ is
studied in the case when $V$ is finite-dimensional and in the case when the
canonical entwining map is bijective.
