  1997",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In the best observed spiral galaxies, the HI is observed to decline slowly
with radius for up to 90% of the maximum extent, before experiencing a rapid
truncation. Early models predicted that the outer parts of spirals would be
fully ionized by a metagalactic UV field at column depths of roughly 10^{19}
atoms cm^{-2}. Weak optical line emission has now been observed beyond the HI
edge in a number of cases and, furthermore, this warm gas has been used to
trace the dark halo far beyond the HI cut-off. But the observed emission
measures (40-90 mR) are higher than expected for a cosmic origin. A more likely
explanation is ionization of the warped outer disk by the blue stellar
population at smaller radius. There are many implications of ionized warped
edges, in particular, severe HI warps may be greatly under represented in
current HI surveys. We briefly discuss the implications of this model for the
Galactic warp.

  Proceedings of the KNAW Colloquium held in Amsterdam, October 15-17, 1997",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Many of the powerful radio galaxies observed at high redshift are very small,
presumably because they are very young. A simple model, which treats the radio
source as a bubble expanding into a radially stratified medium, is capable of
explaining the main features of their size and luminosity evolution. In
particular, the model predicts strong negative luminosity evolution with
increasing size, thus accounting for the large number of short-lived small
sources in flux-limited samples.
  A variety of observational characteristics can be understood within the
framework of the bubble model. I address three of these: 1) the number versus
size statistics, which may provide a clue that jets in radio galaxies are
intermittent, with ""on-off"" cycles lasting only ten to one hundred thousand yr;
2) the rarity of spectral steepening due to synchrotron cooling at frequencies
of a few GHz, and its implications for source geometry and assumptions about
equipartition; and 3) the prevalence of gigahertz-peaked spectra among small
sources.
  I argue that all of these phenomena are primarily the consequence of the
youth and compactness of the radio source, and depend only weakly on
environment. There is no need to postulate an ISM with properties any different
from that of an ordinary nearby galaxy.

high resolution \Lya forest spectra, and include a constraint on the neutral
hydrogen column density determined from the Lyman continuum optical depth in
low resolution spectra. We introduce six separate models to measure D/H and to
assess the systematic dependence on the assumed underlying parameters. We find
that the deuterium absorption feature contains a small amount of contamination
from unrelated \ion{H}{1}. Including the effects of the contamination, we
calculate the 67% confidence interval of D/H in this absorption system, log
(D/H) $= -4.40 ^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$. This measurement agrees with the low
measurement by Burles & Tytler (1997) towards Q1937--1009, and the combined
value gives the best determination of primordial D/H, log (D/H)$_p = -4.47

allows to estimate from an observed spectrum the proper physical parameters of

higher than that of B&T (D/H = $3.0^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-5}$). We also

meteorites have shown that nano-diamonds represent the most abundant form of
presolar dust preserved in meteoritic samples. The presolar diamonds carry
isotopic anomalies which indicate a very complex formation history. Several
groups of diamonds may exist with origin in different types of stars. In order
to identify the sites of formation observationally, we have extracted presolar
diamonds from the Allende meteorite and measured the monochromatic absorption
coefficient in a form which is useful for stellar atmosphere calculations. The
monochromatic absorption coefficient was measured in the wavelength ranges
400--4000 cm-1 (2.5--25 micron) and 12200--52600 cm-1 (190--820 nm). We have
made identical laboratory measurements on CVD diamonds as on the meteoritic
diamonds, in order to get a more solid basis for the interpretation of the
diamond spectrum. The monochromatic absorption coefficient for the presolar
diamonds was incorporated in self-consistent carbon star photospheric models.
The main influence of the diamond dust in our photospheric models is a heating
of the upper photospheric layers and a reduction of the C2H2 abundance. Due to
the relatively small absorption coefficient of the diamonds compared to other
stellar dust grains, their spectral appearance is weak. However, the weak
interaction of the diamonds with the radiation field may give them an important
role in the dust nucleation process. The gas pressure will stay high and the
gas will be much closer to hydrostatic equilibrium during possible diamond
nucleation than is normally the case in dust forming stellar regions, and
therefore allow ample time for the nucleation process.

uses as a rule the old classical method of dispersion equation for complex
frequencies $\omega$ and wave numbers $k$: $\epsilon(\omega,k)=0$. This method
appears to be inapplicable, f.e., in the case of waves in Maxwellian
collisionless plasma when dispersion equation has no solutions. By means of
some refined sophistication L.~Landau in 1946 has suggested in this case
actually to replace the dispersion equation with another one, having a specific
solution (``Landau damping'') and being now widely used in plasma physics.
Recently we have suggested a quite new universal method of two-dimensional
Laplace transformation (in coordinate $x$ and time $t$ for plane wave case),
that allows to obtain asymptotical solutions of original Vlasov plasma
equations as inseparable sets of coupled oscillatory modes (but not a single
wave like $\exp(-i\omega t+i k x)$). The mode parameters are defined in this
case by double-poles ($\omega_n$,$k_n$) of Laplace image $E(\omega_n,k_n)$ of
electrical field $E(x,t)$. This method allows one to obtain the whole set of
oscillatory modes for every concrete problem. It leads to some new ideology in
the theory of plasma oscillations, which are considered as a combination of
coupled oscillatory modes (characterized by pairs ($\omega_n$,$k_n$) and
amplitudes) and depend not only on the intrinsic plasma parameters, but also on
mutually dependent self-consistent initial and boundary conditions and on

penetration to the protected systems was made possible by a quantum computers
in view of results of P.Shor and L.Grover. This work presents the method of
protection of an information in a database from a spy even he knows all about
its control system and has a quantum computer, whereas a database can not
distinguish between operations of spy and legal user.

  Rev. A (tent: May 99)","Phys.Rev.A59:3204,1999","10.1103/PhysRevA.59.3204",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a quantum optical version of Schr\""{o}dinger's famous gedanken
experiment in which the state of a microscopic system (a cavity field) becomes
entangled with and disentangled from the state of a massive object (a movable
mirror). Despite the fact that a mixture of Schr\""{o}dinger cat states is
produced during the evolution (due to the fact that the macroscopic mirror
starts off in a thermal state), this setup allows us to systematically probe
the rules by which a superposition of spatially separated states of a
macroscopic object decoheres. The parameter regime required to test
environment-induced decoherence models is found to be close to those currently
realizable, while that required to detect gravitationally induced collapse is
well beyond current technology.
