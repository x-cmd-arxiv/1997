$M$, we consider a Hermitian connection $\nabla$ on B which is compatible with
all complex structures on $M$ induced by the hyperkaehler structure. Such a
connection is unique, because it is Yang-Mills. We call the bundles admitting
such connections hyperholomorphic bundles. A stable bundle is hyperholomorphic
if and only if its Chern classes $c_1$, $c_2$ are SU(2)-invariant, with respect
to the natural SU(2)-action on the cohomology. For several years, it was known
that the moduli space of stable hyperholomorphic bundles is singular
hyperkaehler. More recently, it was proven that singular hyperkaehler varieties
admit a canonical hyperkaehler desingularization. In the present paper, we show
that a moduli space of stable hyperholomorphic bundles is compact, given some
assumptions on Chern classes of B and hyperkaehler geometry of $M$ (we also
require $dim_C M>2$). Conjecturally, this leads to new examples of hyperkaehler
manifolds. We develop the theory of hyperholomorphic sheaves, which are
(intuitively speaking) coherent sheaves compatible with hyperkaehler structure.
We show that hyperholomorphic sheaves with isolated singularities can be
canonically desingularized by a blow-up. This theory is used to study
degenerations of hyperholomorphic bundles.

stars, young or evolved low-mass stars depending on the kind of galaxy) does
not seem to be exclusively responsible for the ionisation of the hydrogen
filaments that should otherwise cool fast and recombine quickly, the question
arises which extra energy source can produce the quasistationary ionisation. We
show that stationary localized magnetic reconnection in current filaments may
contribute to the ionisation of the extraplanar halo gas. In these filaments
magnetic energy is dissipated. Consequently, the ionised as well as the neutral
component are heated and re-ionised on a time scale significantly shorter than
the recombination time scale. The amount of energy required for efficient
re-ionisation can in principle easily be provided by the free magnetic energy.
We present quasi-static models that are characterized by plasma temperatures
and densities that agree well with the observed values for the diffuse ionised
gas component of the interstellar medium. Plasma-neutral gas fluid simulations
are made to show that the recombination induced dynamical reconnection process
indeed works in a self-regulatory way.

H_2 emission arise on the surface of the cloud and the lines are optically
thin, these lines are not affected by changes in the relative sizes of the
neutral cloud and the CO bearing core, while the optically thick CO emission
can be strongly affected. The sizes of clouds are estimated by measuring the
deviation of CO emission strength from that predicted by a planar cloud model

selected from a sub-mm survey of the distant Universe. This galaxy is the
brightest source in the fields of seven rich, lensing clusters - total area
0.01 deg^2 - that we have mapped with a sensitivity of ~2 mJy/bm at 850um. We
identify a compact optical counterpart with B ~ 23 and a LSB companion 3"" away.
Our spectroscopy shows that components have the same redshift; z = 2.803 +/-
0.003. The emission lines widths, FWHM ~ 1000-1500 km/s, and line ratios, along
with the compact morphology and high luminosity (M_B ~ -24.0) of the galaxy
indicate that SMM 02399-0136 contains a rare dust-embedded, narrow-line or
type-2 AGN. The source is lensed by the foreground cluster, amplifying its
apparent luminosity by a factor of 2.5. Taking this into account, we estimate
that SMM 02399-0136 is five times more luminous than F10214+4724. Its far-IR
and H-alpha luminosities and LSB radio emission are indicative of an extremely
high SFR - several thousand Mo/yr. This assumes that a starburst is the
dominant source of energy, but we cannot yet determine the relative
contributions of the starburst and the buried AGN. A dust mass of 5-7 x 10^8 Mo
is indicated by our data for T(dust) ~ 40-50K, independent of whether the
dominant energy source is an AGN or a starburst. We estimate the possible space
density of such luminous sub-mm sources and find that while a very large
population of these obscured sources could be detected in future wide-field
sub-mm surveys, they are unlikely to dominate the faint counts in this
waveband. Galaxies such as SMM 02399-0136 and F10214+4724 cannot be easily
detected in conventional AGN/QSO surveys, and so estimates of the prevalence of
AGN in the early Universe may require significant revision.

To be published in MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01408.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Collisionless N-body simulations are used in an effort to reproduce the
observed tendency of the surface brightness profile of bulges to change
progressively from a de Vaucouleurs law to an exponential, going from early to
late type spirals. A possible cause for this is the formation of the disc,
later in the history of the galaxy, and this is simulated by applying on the
N-body bulge the force field of a exponential disc whose surface density
increases with time. It is shown that [n], the index of the Sersic law that
best describes the surface brightness profile, does indeed decrease from 4 (de
Vaucouleurs law) to smaller values; this decrease is larger for more massive
and more compact discs. A large part of the observed trend of [n] with B/D
ratio is explained, and many of the actual profiles can be matched exactly by
the simulations. The correlation between the disc scalelength and bulge
effective radius, used recently to support the ""secular evolution"" origin for
bulges, is also shown to arise naturally in a scenario like this. This
mechanism, however, saturates at around n=2 and exponential bulges cannot be
produced; as [n] gets closer to 1, the profile becomes increasingly robust
against a disc field. These results provide strong support to the old-bulge
hypothesis for the early-type bulges. The exponential bulges, however, remain
essentially unexplained; the results here suggest that they did not begin their
lives as de Vaucouleurs spheroids, and hence were probably formed, at least in
part, by different processes than those of early type spirals.

inefficient in hot and rarefied plasmas, and a faster process is called for. We
show that cyclo-synchrotron absorption can be such a process: mildly
relativistic electrons thermalize in a few synchrotron cooling times by
emitting and absorbing cyclo-synchrotron photons. The resulting equilibrium
function is a Maxwellian at low energies, with a high energy tail when Compton
cooling is important. Assuming that electrons emit completely self absorbed
synchrotron radiation and at the same time Compton scatter their own
cyclo-synchrotron radiation and ambient UV photons, we calculate the time
dependent behavior of the electron distribution function, and the final
radiation spectra. In some cases, the 2-10 keV spectra are found to be
dominated by thermal synchrotron self-Compton process rather than by thermal

is stable under a class of deformations of the Gibbs measure. The condition is
satisfied by the Parisi Ansatz, along with an even broader stationarity
property. The stability conditions have equivalent expressions as marginal
additivity of the quenched free energy. Implications of the continuity
assumption include constraints on the overlap distribution, which are expressed
as the vanishing of the expectation value for an infinite collection of
multi-overlap polynomials. The polynomials can be computed with the aid of a
""real""-replica calculation in which the number of replicas is taken to zero.

$S=O(Gm)$ and $Gm\ll L$ where $L$ is the length scale of the background
curvature, we divide the spacetime into two regions; the external region where
the metric is approximated by the background metric plus perturbations due to a
point-like particle and the internal region where the metric is approximated by
that of a black hole plus perturbations due to the tidal effect of the
background curvature, and use the technique of the matched asymptotic expansion
to construct an approximate metric which is valid over the entire region. In
this way, we avoid the divergent self-gravity at the position of the particle
and derive the equations of motion from the consistency condition of the
matching. The matching is done to the order necessary to include the effect of
radiation reaction of $O(Gm)$ with respect to the background metric as well as
the effect of spin-induced force. The reaction term of $O(Gm)$ is found to be
completely due to tails of radiation, that is, due to curvature scattering of
gravitational waves. In other words, the reaction force is found to depend on
the entire history of the particle trajectory. Defining a regularized metric
which consists of the back- ground metric plus the tail part of the perturbed

worldvolume fields that are absent in the massless case, i.e. when the mass

find new couplings between the massive solitonic 5-brane and the target space

couplings have implications for the anomalous creation of branes. In
particular, when a massive solitonic 5-brane passes through a D8-brane a
stretched D6-brane is created. Similarly, in M-theory we find that when an
M5-brane passes through an M9-brane a stretched Kaluza-Klein monopole is
created. Pairs of massive branes of type IIA string theory can be viewed as the
direct and double dimensional reduction of a single ``massive M-brane'' whose

quark-antiquark (MIT bag model) picture, their excitation energies in a nuclear
medium at zero momentum are calculated within mean field approximation. The
scalar, and the vector mesons are assumed to couple directly to the nonstrange
quarks and antiquarks in the $K$ and $\kbar$ mesons. It is demonstrated that
the $\rho$ meson induces different mean field potentials for each member of the
isodoublets, $K$ and $\kbar$, when they are embedded in asymmetric nuclear
matter. Furthermore, it is also shown that this $\rho$ meson potential is
repulsive for the $K^-$ meson in matter with a neutron excess, and renders
$K^-$ condensation less likely to occur.

pseudoscalar mesons are known to be very small, the same matrix elements of
baryons with vector mesons, evaluated in the factorization approximation, are
found to be significant. Within the uncertainties of the factorization
approximation we find that the total rate increases by at most 6% lying within
the error bars of the more recent experimental result. The neutron- to

while the asymmetry parameter is strongly affected as well.

'bare mass' scenario leads to a general scaling behaviour for the meson
$m_T$-spectra when including a mass shift due to the associate strangeness
production threshold for kaons and antikaons whereas a 'dropping' mass scheme
violates this $m_T$-scaling. The relative slope parameters, however, provide
valuable information about the average meson potentials in the nuclear medium.

is evaluated using a nonperturbative unitary coupled channels method and the
standard chiral Lagrangians. The method has proved successful to describe the
pion-pion properties in the scalar isoscalar channel up to 1.2 GeV giving rise
to poles in the t matrix for the f0(980) and the sigma. The extension of the
method to the nuclear medium implies not only the renormalization of the pions
in the medium, but also the introduction of interaction terms related to
contact terms in the pion-nucleon to pion-pion-nucleon interaction. Off shell
effects are also shown to be important leading to cancellations which reduce
the coupled channel integral equations to a set of algebraic equations. As the
density increases we find a reduction of strength below the $\sigma$ region and
a certain accumulation of strength at energies around pion threshold. Our
results, based on chiral Lagrangians, provide similar results to those obtained
with phenomenological models which impose minimal chiral constraints.

algebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0, then H is of
Frobenius type (i.e. if V is an irreducible representation of H then dimV
divides dimH). It was proved by Montgomery and Witherspoon that the conjecture
is true for H of dimension p^n, p prime, and by Nichols and Richmond that if H
has a 2-dimensional representation then dimH is even. In this paper we first
prove that if V is an irreducible representation of D(H), the Drinfeld double
of any finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H over k, then dimV divides
dimH (not just dimD(H)=(dimH)^2). In doing this we use the theory of modular
tensor categories (in particular Verlinde formula). We then use this statement
to prove that Kaplansky's conjecture is true for finite-dimensional semisimple
quasitriangular Hopf algebras over k. As a result we prove easily the result of
Zhu that Kaplansky's conjecture on prime dimensional Hopf algebras over k is
true, by passing to their Drinfeld doubles. Second, we use a theorem of Deligne
on characterization of tannakian categories to prove that triangular semisimple
Hopf algebras over k are equivalent to group algebras as quasi-Hopf algebras.
