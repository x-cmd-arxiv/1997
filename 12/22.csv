simple step, whose algebro-geometric interpretation is the construction of an
elliptic curve isogenous to a given one, specifically one whose period is
double the original period. A higher genus analogue should involve the explicit
construction of a curve whose jacobian is isogenous to the jacobian of a given
curve. The doubling of the period matrix means that the kernel of the isogeny
should be a lagrangian subgroup of the group of points of order 2 in the
jacobian. In genus 2 such a construction was given classically by Humbert and
was studied more recently by Bost and Mestre. In this article we give such a
construction for general curves of genus 3. We also give a similar but simpler
construction for hyperelliptic curves of genus 3. We show that the
hyperelliptic construction is a degeneration of the general one, and we prove
that the kernel of the induced isogeny on jacobians is a lagrangian subgroup of
the points of order 2. We show that for g at least 4 no similar construction
exists, and we also reinterpret the genus 2 case in our setup. Our construction
of these correspondences uses the bigonal and the trigonal constructions,
familiar in the theory of Prym varieties.

different seeing. Using image subtraction appears to be essential for the full
analysis of the microlensing survey images, however a perfect subtraction of
two images is not easy as it requires the derivation of an extremely accurate
convolution kernel. Some empirical attempts to find the kernel have used the
Fourier transform of bright stars, but solving the statistical problem of
finding the best kernel solution has never really been tackled. We demonstrate
that it is possible to derive an optimal kernel solution from a simple least
square analysis using all the pixels of both images, and also show that it is
possible to fit the differential background variation at the same time. We also
show that PSF variations can also be easily handled by the method. To
demonstrate the practical efficiency of the method, we analyzed some images
from a Galactic Bulge field monitored by the OGLE II project.
  We find that the residuals in the subtracted images are very close to the
photon noise expectations. We also present some light curves of variable stars,
and show that, despite high crowding levels, we get an error distribution close
to that expected from photon noise alone. We thus demonstrate that nearly
optimal differential photometry can be achieved even in very crowded fields. We
suggest that this algorithm might be particularly important for microlensing
surveys, where the photometric accuracy and completeness levels could be very
significantly improved by using this method.

variations on timescales of days. For an ionization timescale <1 day, we set an

times the solar one. The line profile (after removing the rotational and
instrumental profiles) is bimodal consisting of two Gaussians, narrow (FWHM =
70 km/s) and broad (FWHM =330km/s). This bimodality is probably due to two
separate broadening mechanisms and velocity fields at the coronal base. It is
possible that TR transient events (random multiple velocities), with a large
surface coverage, give rise to the broadening of the narrow component,while
true microflaring is responsible for the broad one.
  The transition region was observed to flare frequently on different time
scales and magnitudes. The largest impulsive flare seen in the CIV 1549

been due to a chromospheric heating and subsequent evaporation by an electron

break the symmetry between the absorbing states by introducing a

to the conventional directed percolation universality class. In terms of domain
wall language, the parity conservation is not affected by the presence of the
symmetry-breaking field. So the symmetry between the absorbing states rather
than the conservation laws plays an essential role in determining the
universality class. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations for the various
interface dynamics between different absorbing states, which yield new
universal dynamic exponents. With the symmetry-breaking field, the interface
moves, in average, with a constant velocity in the direction of the unpreferred

conductors is studied within the framework of the uniformly frustrated
anisotropic 3D XY-model. A finite-field counterpart of an Onsager vortex-loop
transition in extreme type-II superconductors renders the vortex liquid phase-
incoherent when the Abrikosov vortex lattice undergoes a first order melting
transition. For the filling fractions considered in this paper $f$ given by
$1/f=12,14,16,20,25,32,48,64,72,84,96,112$, and 128, the vortex liquid phase is
not describable as a liquid of well-defined field induced vortex lines. This is
due to the proliferation of thermally induced closed vortex-loops with dia-
meters of order the magnetic length in the problem, resulting in a ""percolation
transition"" driven by non-field induced vortices also transverse to the direc-
tion of the applied magnetic field. This immediately triggers flux-line lattice
melting and loss of phase-coherence in all direction. In a non-relativistic 2D
boson-analogy picture, this latter feature would correspond to a vanishing mass
of the bosons. Scaling functions for the specific heat are calculated in zero
and finite magnetic field. From this we conclude that the critical region is of
order 10% of $T_c$ for a mass anisotropy $\sqrt{M_z/M}=3$, and increases with
increasing mass anisotropy. The entropy jump at the melting transition is cal-
culated as a function of magnetic field for a mass-ansitropy slightly lower
than that in $YBCO$, and found to be $\Delta S=0.1k_B$ per vortex panncake,
independent of the magnetic field for the filling fractions considered here.
This is slightly lower than experimental values of $\Delta S \approx 0.4k_B$
found experimentally for $YBCO$. We attribute this to the slightly lower mass
anisotropy used in our simulations.

Now we are dealing with the bifurcation of the solution of the equation for the
binary distribution function. Microscopic expressions for elastic moduli and
the Frank constant of hexatic phase are derived on the base of comparison of
distribution functions asymptotic behavior with the results of phenomenological
theories. We use our approach for the calculation of the phase boundary between
usual isotropic liquid and hexatic phase and slightly modified traditional DFT
for the phase boundary between hexatic phase and crystalline solid for a number
of 2D systems (hard disks, classical electron crystal, thin superconducting
films, Yukawa system etc.)

Kac-Moody symmetries, such as the Monster sporadic group, arise as gauge
symmetries of the resulting spacetime and of superstring theories.

quantization, terminates without any infinite tower of unphysical states. The
termination point depends on the model parameters and the dimension of the
SU(2) representation. Representations, in which the nucleon and $\Delta_{33}$
resonance are the only stable states, exist. The model is developed for both
irreducible and reducible representations of general dimension. States with
spin larger than 1/2 are shown to be deformed. The representation dependence of

well-pronounced clustering, so-called Hoehler clusters. For nonstrange baryons
the Hoehler clusters are shown to be identical to Lorentz multiplets of the
type (j,j)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] with j being a half-integer. For the Lambda
hyperons below 1800 MeV these clusters are shown to be of the type [(1,0)+
(0,1)]*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] while above 1800 MeV they are parity duplicated
(J,0)+(0,J) (Weinberg-Ahluwalia) states. Therefore, for Lambda hyperons the
restoration of chiral symmetry takes place above 1800 MeV. Finally, it is
demonstrated that the description of spin-3/2 particles in terms of a 2nd rank
antisymmetric Lorentz tensor with Dirac spinor components does not contain any
off-shell parameters and avoids the main difficulties of the Rarita-Schwinger
description based upon a 4-vector with Dirac spinor components.

naturally projected onto the $(n-1)$th one, so that one can form the projective
limit of the centralizer algebras as $n\to\infty$ with $m$ fixed. The main
result of the paper is a precise description of this limit (or stable)
centralizer algebra, denoted by $A_m$. We explicitly construct an algebra
isomorphism $A_m=Z\otimes Y_m$, where $Z$ is a commutative algebra and $Y_m$ is
the so-called twisted Yangian associated to the rank $m$ classical Lie algebra
of type B, C, or D. The algebra $Z$ may be viewed as the algebra of virtual
Laplace operators; it is isomorphic to the algebra of polynomials with
countably many indeterminates. The twisted Yangian $Y_m$ (and hence the algebra
$A_m$) can be described in terms of a system of generators with quadratic and
linear defining relations which are conveniently presented in R-matrix form
involving the so-called reflection equation. This extends the earlier work on
the type A case by the second author.

box performing one step of this algorithm. If we consider this black box as an
oracle which gives a value F(a) for any query a, we can compute T sequential
applications of F on a classical computer relative to this oracle in time T.
  It is proved that if T=O(2^{n/7}), where n is the length of input, then the
result of T sequential applications of F can not be computed on quantum
computer with oracle for F for all possible F faster than in time \Omega (T).
This means that there is no general method of quantum speeding up of classical
algorithms provided in such a general method a classical algorithm is regarded
as iterated applications of a given black box.
  For an arbitrary time complexity T a lower bound for the time of quantum
simulation was found to be \Omega (T^{1/2}).
