compact clumps, distributed along an axis that is aligned with the major axis

lying in the inner parsec of a molecular disk rotating in the same sense as the
rest of the galaxy. However, the velocity field has a significant
non-rotational component, which may indicate supersonic turbulence. The bright
maser emission is not coincident with any detected compact 22 GHz continuum

beamed amplification of continuum emission. We observed two compact continuum
sources that have inverted spectra between 5 and 8 GHz, and steep spectra
between 8 and 22 GHz. NGC 3079 may be a nearby, low-luminosity example of the
class of compact symmetric gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources. We
detected a third continuum component that lies along the same axis as the other

developed. The analogue of the odd number theorem for cusped density
distributions is given. Density cusps are classified into strong, isothermal or
weak, according to their lensing properties. Strong cusps cause multiple
imaging for any source position, whereas isothermal and weak cusps give rise to
only one image for distant sources. Isothermal cusps always possess a
pseudo-caustic. When the source crosses the pseudo-caustic, the number of
images changes by unity.Two families of cusped galaxy and cluster models are
examined in detail. The double power-law family has an inner cusp, followed by
a transition region and an outer envelope. One member of this family -- the
isothermal double power-law model -- possesses an exceedingly scarce property,
namely, the lens equation is exactly solvable for any source position. This
means that the magnifications, the time delay and the lensing cross-sections
are all readily available. The model has a three dimensional density that is
cusped like $r^{-2}$ at small radii and falls off like $r^{-4}$ asymptotically.
Thus, it provides a very useful representation of the lensing properties of a
galaxy or cluster of finite total mass with a flat rotation curve. The second
set of models studied is the single power-law family. These are single density
cusps of infinite extent. The properties of the critical curves and caustics
and the behaviour of the lenses in the presence of external shear are all
discussed in some detail.

theory (PT) of small cosmic fluctuations. We consider only the spherically
symmetric or monopole contribution to the PT integrals, which yields the exact
result for tree-graphs (i.e. at leading order). We find that the non-linear
evolution in Lagrangian space is then given by a simple {\it local}
transformation over the initial conditions, although it is not local in Euler
space. This transformation is found to be described the spherical collapse (SC)
dynamics, as it is the exact solution in the shearless (and therefore local)
approximation in Lagrangian space. Taking advantage of this property, it is
straightforward to derive the one-point cumulants, $\xi_J$, for both the
unsmoothed and smoothed density fields to {\it arbitrary} order in the
perturbative regime. To leading order this reproduces, and provides with a
simple explanation for, the exact results obtained by Bernardeau (1992, 1994).
We then show that the SC model leads to accurate estimates for the next
corrective terms when compared to the results derived in the exact perturbation
theory making use of the loop calculations (Scoccimarro & Frieman 1996). The
agreement is within a few per cent for the hierarchical ratios $S_J=
\xi_J/\xi_2^{J-1}$. We compare our analytic results to N-body simulations,
which turn out to be in very good agreement up to scales where $\sigma \approx
1$. A similar treatment is presented to estimate higher order corrections in
the Zel'dovich approximation. These results represent a powerful and readily
usable tool to produce analytical predictions to describe the gravitational
clustering of large scale structure in the weakly non-linear regime.

robust scaling laws. Deviation from these scaling laws signals sequence
homology, and can be used to guide the empirical selection of scoring

accomplished in a computationally efficient way by using a novel approach

fermions at the usual price of anomalies: helicity/parity invariance will be
lost in even/odd dimensions, and in the latter even at zero mass. Gauge
invariance dictates a very general ``Fourier'' representation of the action in
terms of the holonomies that carry the novel, large gauge invariant,
information. We show that large (unlike small) transformations and hence their
Ward identities, are not perturbative order-preserving, and clarify the role of
(properly redefined) Chern-Simons terms in this context. From a powerful
representation of the action in terms of massless heat kernels, we are able to
obtain rigorous gauge invariant expansions, for both small and large fermion
masses, of its separate parity even and odd parts in arbitrary dimension. The
representation also displays both the nonperturbative origin of a finite
renormalization ambiguity, and its physical resolution by requiring decoupling
at infinite mass. Finally, we illustrate these general results by explicit
computation of the effective action for some physical examples of field
configurations in the three dimensional case, where our conclusions on finite

Lorentz gauge condition is automatically satisfied. The angular distribution of
emitted photons reproduces the directions of maximum emission of the standard
formalism. The Maxwell formalism in terms of continuous and distributed fields
is retrieved by the smearing of these discrete fields over the light-cone, and
in this process scalar and longitudinal photons are necessarily created and
added. Divergences and singularities are by-products of this averaging process.
The discrete and the continuous formalisms are not equivalent. The discrete one
is superior for not having divergencies, singularities, unphysical degrees of
freedom, for describing processes of creation and annihilation of particles
instead of advanced solutions, for having a natural explanation for the photon,
and for generating the continuous formalism as an effective one. It enlightens

principle, proton-proton bremsstrahlung can yield no more information about the
off-shell properties of the nucleon-nucleon interaction than can already be
deduced from the on-shell properties. In this note we challenge Fearing's
conclusion.
