automaton rules of a given number of inputs which conserve the number of active
sites. These rules have to satisfy a necessary and sufficient condition. If the
active sites are viewed as cells occupied by identical particles, these
cellular automaton rules represent evolution operators of systems of identical
interacting particles whose total number is conserved. Some of these rules,
which allow motion in both directions, mimic ensembles of one-dimensional
pseudo-random walkers. Numerical evidence indicates that the corresponding
stochastic processes might be non-Gaussian.

several of the intervening systems for any shape of the background radiation.
For these systems we can also rule out any contribution from the stellar

overabundance is needed in other intervening systems if the radiation field
from stellar sources contributes significantly to the UV background.
Overabundance is, however, present in Lyman alpha forest clouds at redshifts

photometric accuracy in J and star/galaxy separation in I (also used for

These non-magnetic monolayers displace the magnetic solid-like He-3 monolayers

In the low temperature limit (T < 10 mK) the coefficient can be described by
dP/dT ~ s/6v, where dP is the pressure difference across the plug generated by
the temperature difference dT and s and v are the molar entropy and volume.
This low temperature limit corresponds to the condition d << l_q, where d is
the pore diameter and l_q is the bulk liquid He-3 quasiparticle mean free path;
that is, the quasiparticles are predominantly boundary scattered in the pores.
The measured coefficient is half that calculated by Edwards, Culman and He.
When compared with this new experimental result for the He-4 plated porous
plug, the earlier result for pure liquid He-3 is strikingly larger (by up to
30x at 2 mK). This enhancement is reminiscent of the giant thermopowers
measured in Kondo and other dilute magnetic alloys. It is speculated that the
enhanced thermomechanical coefficient for pure liquid He-3 is due to magnetic
scattering of the He-3 quasiparticles by the two magnetic solid-like He-3

the consequences of the existence of negative dimensional operators, we
consider the random-bond XY model. It has been argued that the XY model on a
square lattice, when weakly perturbed by random phases, has a quasi-long-range
ordered phase (the random spin wave phase) at sufficiently low temperatures. We
show that infinitely many relevant perturbations to the proposed critical
action for the random spin wave phase were omitted in all previous treatments.
The physical origin of these perturbations is intimately related to the
existence of broadly distributed correlation functions. We find that those
relevant perturbations do enter the Renormalization Group equations, and affect
critical behavior. This raises the possibility that the random XY model has no

that at low energies in large eleven dimensions, the theory should be
effectively described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. This effective
description breaks down at much lower energies than naively expected, precisely
when the system saturates the Bekenstein bound on energy density. We show that
the number of partons scales like the area of the surface surrounding the

mechanisms of Dalitz decay, primary vector meson decay, decay of charmed

explanation of the observed dilepton spectra in central heavy-ion collisions
requires contributions other than these direct decays and also various medium

find that the low-mass dilepton enhancement can be satisfactorily explained.
Furthermore, to explain the intermediate-mass dilepton enhancement in heavy-ion

very important. Finally, the single photon spectra in our calculations with

charge c is isomorphic to the category of algebras over rational genus-zero
modular functors (certain analytic partial operads) of central charge c
satisfying certain generalized meromorphicity. This result is one main step in
the construction of genus-zero conformal field theories from representations of
vertex operator algebras announced in [H5] (q-alg/9512024). One byproduct of
the proof of the present isomorphism theorem is a geometric construction of
(framed) braid group representations from intertwining operator algebras and
thus from representations of suitable vertex operator algebras.

apply the quantum singular time dependent oscillator model to describe the
relative one dimensional motion of two ions in a trap. We argue that the model
can be justified for low energy excited states with the quantum numbers $n\ll
n_{max}\sim 100$, provided that the dimensionless constant characterizing the
strength of the repulsive potential is large enough, $g_*\sim 10^5$. Time
dependent Gaussian-like wave packets generalizing odd coherent states of the
harmonic oscillator, and excitation number eigenstates are constructed. We show
that the relative motion of the ions, in contradistinction to its center of
mass counterpart, is extremely sensitive to the time dependence of the binding
harmonic potential, since the large value of $g_*$ results in a significant
amplification of the transition probabilities between energy eigenstate even
for slow time variations of the frequency.
