features of a variety of adaptive competitive systems in the social and
biological sciences. Each of N agents, at each time step of a game, joins one
of two groups. The agents in the minority group are awarded a point, while the
agents in the majority group get nothing. Each agent has a fixed set of
strategies drawn at the beginning of the game from a common pool, and chooses
his current best-performing strategy to determine which group to join. For a
fixed N, the system exhibits a phase change as a function of the size of the
common strategy pool from which the agents initially draw their strategies. For
small pool sizes, the system is in an efficient market phase. All information
that can be used by the agents' strategies is traded away, no agent can
accumulate more points than would an agent making random guesses, and thus the
commons suffer,since relatively few points are awarded to the agents in total.
For large initial strategy pool sizes, the system is in an inefficient market
phase, in which there is predictive information available to the agents'
strategies, and some agents can do better than random at accumulating points.
In this phase, the total number of points awarded to the agents is greater than
in a game in which all agents guess randomly, and so the commons do relatively
well. At a critical size of the strategy pool marking the cross-over from the
efficient market to the inefficient market phases, the commons do best. This
critical size of the pool grows monotonically with N. The behavior of this
system has some features reminiscent of a spin-glass.

information on stellar evolutionary theory. Two low-level features above the

Zaritsky & Lin (1997) and Alcock et al. (1997) as the possible signature of an
intervening population. I conclude that one of the features, which has also
been associated with the red giant branch bump (RGB-bump) predicted by theory
and observed in globular clusters, is instead produced during asymtotic giant
branch (AGB) evolution. I will call it the AGB-bump. In this paper, it will be
shown that the stellar evolution predictions about the position and strength of
the AGB-bump are in very good agreement with the observed structures in the
LMC, M31 and globular clusters. The position in the CMD of the other feature is
consistent with the location of the blue-loops of a few Myr old stars and it
has also been observed in the CMD of other galaxies with a young stellar
population.

of the large-scale structure. In some clusters of galaxies peripherally located
sources of extended diffuse radio emission exist, the so-called cluster radio
relics. They have steep radio spectra but no apparent cutoff, as old remnants
of radio galaxies usually have. Therefore particle acceleration has to take
place within them. We propose that shock structures of the cosmological
large-scale matter flows are responsible for the acceleration of relativistic
electrons: cluster accretion shocks and bow shocks of merger events. We develop
a theory of radio plasma having traversed these shocks and compare it to
observational data of nine radio relics (0038-096, 0917+75, 1140+203, 1253+275,
1712+64, 1706+78, 2006-56, 2010-57, 1401-33) and their host clusters (A85,
A786, A1367, Coma, A2255, A2256, A3667, S753). The necessary accretion power,
the spectral index of the radio spectrum, the acceleration efficiency of the
shock, the diffusion coefficient in the post-shock region, and the predicted
radio polarization in all of our examples fit into a coherent interpretation of
the observational data. Since polarization measurements are available only for
four sources, the predictions of our theory can be independently checked using
other examples. The predicted values of the shock compression ratio, density
and temperature of the infalling gas, magnetic field strength of the shocked
and unshocked radio plasma are discussed within the frame of structure

telescopes at Arecibo, Green Bank, and Jodrell Bank. By combining our new
observations with data collected up to seven years earlier, we obtain a
significantly improved solution for the astrometric, spin, and orbital
parameters of the system. For the first time in any binary pulsar system, no
fewer than five relativistic or ""post-Keplerian"" orbital parameters are
measurable with useful accuracies in a theory-independent way. We find the
orbital period of the system to be decreasing at a rate close to that expected
from gravitational radiation damping, according to general relativity, although
the precision of this test is limited to about 15% by the otherwise poorly
known distance to the pulsar. The remaining post-Keplerian parameters are all
consistent with one another and all but one of them have fractional accuracies
better than 1%. By assuming that general relativity is the correct theory of

masses of the pulsar and companion star each to be 1.339+-0.003 Msun and the

of (6.8 +- 0.6)%, and nearly coherent oscillations (NCOs) during a Type-I burst
with a frequency of 549 Hz. The frequency of the QPOs in the persistent flux is
correlated with the mass accretion rate on time scale of hours, but not on time
scale of days. This is most likely the manifestation in a single source of the
kHz QPO puzzle observed among many sources, i.e., on the one hand, individual
sources show a correlation between the QPO frequency and the inferred mass
accretion rate, on the other hand, the dozen or so sources with luminosities
spanning two decades have essentially the same QPO frequencies. We propose that
this multi-valued QPO frequency and mass accretion rate correlation indicates
the existence of many similar regimes of the accretion disk. These regimes,
with a very similar energy spectrum and QPO frequency, are distinguished from
each other by the mass accretion rate or the total X-ray flux. The NCOs during
the burst can be made almost perfectly coherent by taking into account a large
frequency derivative. This strongly suggests that this frequency is related to
the neutron star spin frequency. The large frequency derivative is attributable
to the expansion or contraction of the neutron star photosphere during the
burst.

and multiple peaks of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). In one, there is a very quick
release of energy at a central site resulting in a single relativistic shell
that produces peaks in the time history through its interactions with the
ambient material. In the other, the central site sporadically releases energy
over hundreds of seconds forming a peak with each burst of energy. We present
three kinematic arguments against a single relativistic shell. These arguments
are based only on symmetry. We show that the average envelope of emission of
GRBs is a linear function rather than the power law expected for a single
relativistic shell. We show that presence of gaps in GRBs is the strongest
argument against a single relativistic shell. We estimate that the fraction of
a single shell that can produce gamma-rays in a GRB with multiple peaks is
about 0.001, implying that single relativistic shells require 1000 times more
energy than previously thought. We conclude that either the central site of a
GRB must produce 10^{51} erg/s for hundreds of seconds, or the relativistic
shell must have structure on a scales the order of sqrt(epsilon)/Gamma, where
Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor and epsilon is the efficiency.

Using a geometric representative of \mu(pt), the boundary region of moduli

condition thus reduces to the interior of the k+1st ASD moduli space,

1/8 of what is needed for simple type, again regardless of the topology or

geometric representative answer is surprising but not contradictory, as the
contribution of a fixed region to the Donaldson invariants is geometric, not

neither identical to the ultrasoft r\'egime corresponding to radiative
processes with energies and momenta of order $Mv^2$, nor to the potential
r\'egime with on shell heavy particles and Coulomb binding. In this soft
r\'egime, massless particles are on shell, and heavy particle propagators
become static. Examples show that it contributes to one- and two-loop

NRQFT agrees with the results of threshold expansion. A simple example also
demonstrates the power of dimensional regularisation in NRQFT.

variable-flavor-number scheme which incorporates initial/final state heavy

dependence in the hard cross-section. This formalism has the built-in feature
of reducing to the FFN scheme near threshold, and to the conventional zero-mass

nucleon. The formation of this condensate is related to the realisation of
U_A(1) symmetry breaking by tunneling processes such as instantons. If it is
present, the polarised condensate induces a term in g_1 which has support only
at x=0. Tunneling processes then induce a net transfer of ``spin'' from finite
x to x=0. The polarised condensate may be measured by comparing the
flavour-singlet axial charges which are extracted from polarised deep inelastic
and nu p elastic scattering experiments.

D5-branes. On the moduli space, excitations with fractional momenta arise due
to a residual discrete gauge invariance. It is argued that, in the infra-red,
the lowest energy excitations are described by an effective c=6, N=4 SCFT on
T^4, also valid in the large black hole regime. The ``effective string
tension'' is obtained using T-duality covariance. While at the microscopic
level, minimal scalars do not couple to (1,5) strings, in the effective theory
a coupling is induced by (1,1) and (5,5) strings, leading to Hawking radiation.
These considerations imply that, at least for such black holes, the calculation
of the Hawking decay rate for minimal scalars has a sound foundation in string
theory and statistical mechanics and, hence, there is no information loss.

Horava and Witten, an 11-dimensional supergravity theory is coupled to matter

that realistic unification models are obtained, after compactification of 6
dimensions, as theories of 5-dimensional supergravity in an interval, coupling
to matter fields on 4-dimensional walls. Supersymmetry breaking may be
communicated from one boundary to another by the 5-dimensional fields. In this
paper, we study a toy model of this communication in which 5-dimensional
super-Yang-Mills theory in the bulk couples to chiral multiplets on the walls.
Using the auxiliary fields of the Yang-Mills multiplet, we find a simple
algorithm for coupling the bulk and boundary fields. We demonstrate two
different mechanisms for generating soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the
boundary theory. We also compute the Casimir energy generated by supersymmetry
breaking.

supersymmetric bound states of 2-branes at angles and 6-branes. The general
bound state contains an arbitrary number of branes rotated relative to each
other, and we derive the condition for these rotations to preserve
supersymmetry. The microscopic bound state degeneracy matches the black hole
entropy in detail. The entire 56 charge spectrum of extremal black holes in N=8

simulations show that different patterns are obtained when space and time steps
($\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$) are varied independently. On the other hand,
anisotropy effects due to the symmetries of the discretization lattice prevent
the quantitative calibration of models. We introduce a new class of explicit
difference methods for numerical integration of diffusion and
reaction-diffusion equations, where the dependence on space and time scales
occurs naturally. Numerical solutions approach the exact solution of the
continuous diffusion equation for finite $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$, if the
parameter $\gamma_N=D \Delta t/(\Delta x)^2$ assumes a fixed constant value,
where $N$ is an odd positive integer parametrizing the alghorithm. The error
between the solutions of the discrete and the continuous equations goes to zero
as $(\Delta x)^{2(N+2)}$ and the values of $\gamma_N$ are dimension
independent. With these new integration methods, anisotropy effects resulting
from the finite differences are minimized, defining a standard for validation
and calibration of numerical solutions of diffusion and reaction-diffusion
equations. Comparison between numerical and analytical solutions of
reaction-diffusion equations give global discretization errors of the order of
$10^{-6}$ in the sup norm. Circular patterns of travelling waves have a maximum
relative random deviation from the spherical symmetry of the order of 0.2%, and
the standard deviation of the fluctuations around the mean circular wave front
is of the order of $10^{-3}$.
