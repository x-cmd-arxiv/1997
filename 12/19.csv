be matched with the mass function of dark matter haloes predicted by

limited by the back-reaction of the emitted energy on the accretion flow in a
self-gravitating disc. This would imply a relation of black hole to halo mass
of the form M_bh ~(v_halo)^5 and a typical duration of the optically bright QSO
phase of a few times 10^7 yr. The high integrated mass density of black holes
inferred from recent black hole mass estimates in nearby galaxies may indicate
that the overall efficiency of supermassive black holes for producing blue
light is smaller than previously assumed. We discuss three possible accretion
modes with low optical emission efficiency: (i) accretion at far above the
Eddington rate, (ii) accretion obscured by dust, and (iii) accretion below the
critical rate leading to an advection dominated accretion flow lasting for a
Hubble time. We further argue that accretion with low optical efficiency might
be closely related to the origin of the hard X-ray background and that the
ionizing background might be progressively dominated by stars rather than QSOs

Pup, gamma2 Vel and beta Cen A with (logarithmic) reduction factors
-0.37+/-0.09, -0.18+/-0.10, and -0.61+/-0.12 dex, respectively.
  While Ar can condense onto the surfaces of dust grains in the interiors of
dense clouds, it is unlikely that argon atoms are depleted by this process in
the low-density lines of sight considered in this study. Instead, we propose
that the relatively large photoionization cross section of Ar makes it much
easier to hide in its ionized form than H. In regions that are about half
ionized, this effect can lower Ar I/H I by -0.11 to -0.96 dex, depending on the
energy of the photoionizing radiation and its intensity divided by the local
electron density. We apply this interpretation for the condition of the gas in
front of beta Cen A, which shows the largest deficiency of Ar. Also, we
determine the expected magnitudes of the differential ionizations for He, N, O,
Ne and Ar in the partly ionized, warm gas in the local cloud around our solar
system. For the local cloud and others that can be probed by UV studies, the
observed Ar I to H I ratio may be a good discriminant between two possible
alternatives, collisional ionization or photoionization, for explaining the

against the observed UV, B and IR broad band comoving luminosity densities.
Using these spectrophotometric results, we analyze the global metal enrichment
with the help of chemical evolutionary models and we discuss the pertinence of
different metallicity tracers (quasar absorption systems and clusters of
galaxies) as representative of the bulk chemical evolution of the Universe.
Moreover, as deuterium is very fragile, this isotope is destroyed in all stars
and its evolution is particularly sensitive to the history of star formation.
Relying on models constrained to fit the solar vicinity, it is shown that
models with high D destruction corresponding to a large decrease of the star
formation rate (SFR) from $z=1.5$ to 0 are in good agreement with
spectrophotometric data. In contrast, low D destruction models which require
only a moderate variation of the SFR in the same redshift range seem to
encounter difficulties in matching the evolution of the luminosity densities

ascertain the physical properties of the faint morphological populations. We
find four principal results: Firstly that the population of objects classified
as `peculiar' are intrinsically luminous in the optical ($M_B\sim -19$).
Secondly these systems tend to be strong sources of [OII] line luminosity.
Thirdly the optical-infrared colours of the faint population (a) confirm the
presence of a population of compact blue galaxies and (b) show the stellar
populations of Irregular/Peculiar galaxies encompass a wide range in age.
Finally a surface-brightness comparison with the local galaxy sample of Frei et

rather we find that all morphological classes have evolved to a higher surface
brightness at higher-redshifts ($z>0.3$).

homogeneous, the X-ray emission will trace the denser component, and the
temperature determination may not be relevant for the lower density gas which
is dominating the SZ measurements. Moreover, the X-ray brightness decreases
very rapidly with the distance, which is not the case for the SZ effect.
Distant clusters might be detected from SZ measurements, whereas they are
inaccessible to X-ray observations. For these reasons, we have investigated the
possibility to derive the electronic temperature of the gas from the SZ
measurements in the submillimeter range (lambda ~ 300-600 micro-m). We show
that given the sensitivities of the future submillimeter space missions Planck
Surveyor and FIRST, the electronic temperature of massive clusters

existence of a critical length for self-trapping in spatially restricted

study by means of direct diagonalization preserving the full dynamics and
quantum nature of phonons. The crossover from large to small polarons shows up

by bosonization techniques and the self-harmonic approximation. The elementary
excitation is the creation of a localized domain structure where the dimerized
order is the opposite to the one of the surroundings. It is a triplet
excitation whose formation energy is smaller than the magnon gap. Magnetic
internal excitations of the domain are possible and give the further
excitations of the system. We discuss these results in the context of recent

on-site Coulomb interactions. As these wave functions employ correlators for
the exact atomic eigenstates they are exact both in the non-interacting and in
the atomic limit. We evaluate them in infinite lattice dimensions for all
interaction strengths without any restrictions on the structure of the
Hamiltonian or the symmetry of the ground state. The results for the
ground-state energy allow us to derive an effective one-electron Hamiltonian
for Landau quasi-particles, applicable for finite temperatures and frequencies
within the Fermi-liquid regime. As applications for a two-band model we study
the Brinkman-Rice metal-to-insulator transition at half band-filling, and the
transition to itinerant ferromagnetism for two specific fillings, at and close
to a peak in the density of states of the non-interacting system. Our new
results significantly differ from those for earlier Gutzwiller wave functions
where only density-type interactions were included. When the correct spin
symmetries for the two-electron states are taken into account, the importance
of the Hund's-rule exchange interaction is even more pronounced and leads to
paramagnetic metallic ground states with large local magnetic moments.
Ferromagnetism requires fairly large interaction strengths, and the resulting
ferromagnetic state is a strongly correlated metal.

model is defined on a one-dimensional lattice, with each lattice site having
two binary variables, one of which is conserved (``buses'') and one of which is
non-conserved (``passengers''). The buses are driven in a preferred direction
and are slowed down by the presence of passengers who arrive with rate lambda.
We study the model by simulation, heuristic argument and a mean-field theory.
All these approaches provide strong evidence of a transition between an
inhomogeneous ``jammed'' phase (where the buses bunch together) and a
homogeneous phase as the bus density is increased. However, we argue that a
strict phase transition is present only in the limit lambda -> 0. For small
lambda, we argue that the transition is replaced by an abrupt crossover which
is exponentially sharp in 1/lambda. We also study the coarsening of gaps
between buses in the jammed regime. An alternative interpretation of the model
is given in which the spaces between ``buses'' and the buses themselves are
interchanged. This describes a system of particles whose mobility decreases the
longer they have been stationary and could provide a model for, say, the flow
of a gelling or sticky material along a pipe.

concave affine 3-manifolds along mutually disjoint totally geodesic tori or

of baryonic states with different values of strangeness for any baryon number
B. In the sector with B=1 the well known octet and decuplet of baryons are
described within CSA, and some exotic states are predicted. In the B=2 sector
there are many predictions, but only few of them - e.g. the existence of the
virtual $\Lambda$N-state - have been confirmed till now. Possible reasons for
this are discussed. In particular, the B=2 SO(3) hedgehog interpreted usually
as H-particle within CSA has dimensions considerably smaller than dimensions of
the deuteron. Therefore, the estimates of its production cross section made
previously in the assumption that H-particle and deuteron are approximately of
the same size, may be too optimistic. Other branches of the CSA predictions
corresponding to other local minima of the B=2 configurations of the SU(3)
chiral fields: SU(2) torus and skyrmion molecule with strangeness content close
to 0.5 are also considered.

fixing mechanism which entails a gaussian representation for propagators in
scalar field theories. Here, we describe this mechanism in the fullest detail.
The fixed values are in fact mean-values which can be determined via
consistency conditions. The consistency conditions imply that one
$\alpha$-parameter is integrated in the usual way and the dependence of the
mean-values of the other $\alpha$-parameters on it must be determined. Here we
present a method for doing this exactly which requires the solution of an
equation system. We present an analytic solution for this equation system in
the case of the ladder-graph topology. The Regge behaviour is obtained in a
simple way as well as an analytic expression for the leading Regge trajectory.
Then, the consistency equations for the two (in the ladder case) independent
$\alpha$-parameters mean-values are solved numerically. Agreement with previous
determinations of the intercept $\alpha (0)$ is obtained for $\alpha (0) \
\gsim$ 0.3. However, we are able to calculate $\alpha (t/m^2)$ for - 3.6
$\lsim$ $t/m^2$ $\lsim$ 1.8 and find that it is close to linear.
  We consider the massless limit of the theory and find that the
$\alpha$-parameters mean-values and the trajectory $\alpha (t)$ have limits
which are independent of the mass, a phenomenon which also occurs for
renormalizable theories via the renormalization group equations.

  Dynamics","plain latex, 54 pages","Acta Phys.Polon. B29 (1998) 1979-2064",,,"hep-th",,"  We outline a method of deriving boost invariant hamiltonians for effective
particles in quantum field theory. The hamiltonians are defined and calculated
using creation and annihilation operators in light-front dynamics. The
renormalization group equations are written for a sequence of unitary
transformations which gradually transform the bare canonical creation and
annihilation operators of a local theory to the creation and annihilation
operators of effective particles in an effective theory with the same dynamical
content but a finite range of energy transfers due to form factors in the
interaction vertices. The boost invariant effective hamiltonians can be used to
describe the constituent dynamics in relativistically moving systems including
the rest and the infinite momentum frame. The general equations are illustrated
in perturbation theory by second-order calculations of self-energy and
two-particle interaction terms in Yukawa theory, QED and QCD. In Yukawa theory,
one obtains the generalized Yukawa potential including its full
off-energy-shell extension and form factors in the vertices. In QED, the
effective hamiltonian eigenvalue problem converges for small coupling constants
to the Schr\""odinger equation but the typical relativistic ultraviolet
singularities at short distances between constituents are regularized by the
similarity form factors. In the second-order QCD effective hamiltonian one
obtains a boost invariant logarithmically confining quark-anti-quark
interaction term which may remain uncanceled in the non-abelian dynamics of
effective quarks and gluons.

even. If p is odd one has the familiar eg'-ge'= 2nh, whereas for even p one

by introducing Dirac strings and taking due account of the multiple
connectedness of the configuration space of the strings and the dyons. A
two-potential formulation of the theory that treats the electric and magnetic

A58 (1998) 116","10.1103/PhysRevA.58.116",,"quant-ph",,"  A measuring apparatus is described by quantum mechanics while it interacts
with the quantum system under observation, and then it must be given a
classical description so that the result of the measurement appears as
objective reality. Alternatively, the apparatus may always be treated by
quantum mechanics, and be measured by a second apparatus which has such a dual
description. This article examines whether these two different descriptions are
mutually consistent. It is shown that if the dynamical variable used in the
first apparatus is represented by an operator of the Weyl-Wigner type (for
example, if it is a linear coordinate), then the conversion from quantum to
classical terminology does not affect the final result. However, if the first
apparatus encodes the measurement in a different type of operator (e.g., the
phase operator), the two methods of calculation may give different results.

straightforward extensions of those for two particles because of the lack of
symmetry they possess. We propose purification protocols for a wide range of
mixed entangled states of many particles. These are useful for understanding
entanglement, and will be of practical significance in multi-user cryptographic
schemes or distributed quantum computation and communication. We show that
operating locally on multi-particle entangled states directly is more efficient
than relying on two-particle purification.

  quant-ph/9712030 by L. Salasnich","2 pages, Revtex, no figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We demonstrate analytically that a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a
harmonic trap with zero-range attractive interparticle interactions is unstable
if there is more than 1 boson. Replacing the zero-range interaction by a
short-range attractive interaction lifts the instability, and leads to a
pronounced clustering, by which the particles leak out of the condensate.

inverse scattering method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We first
establish the essential tools to solve the eigenvalue problem for the transfer
matrix of the classical ``covering'' Hubbard model within the algebraic Bethe
Ansatz framework. The fundamental commutation rules exhibit a hidden 6-vertex
symmetry which plays a crucial role in the whole algebraic construction. Next
we apply this formalism to study the SU(2) highest weights properties of the
eigenvectors and the solution of a related coupled spin model with twisted
boundary conditions. The machinery developed in this paper is applicable to
many other models, and as an example we present the algebraic solution of the
Bariev XY coupled model.

dictionary between the solutions of q-KP and the 1-Toda lattice equations,
obeying some special requirement; this is based on an algebra isomorphism
between difference operators and D-operators, where $Df(x)=f(qx)$. Therefore,
every notion about the 1-Toda lattice can be transcribed into q-language.
