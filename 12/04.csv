(0.40+-0.04) of solar. There is no significant evidence for any variation in
the abundance with position in the cluster. The global X-ray spectra, central

the Galactic value for the soft X-ray absorption toward the cluster. The PSPC

Detection of this time-dependence can be used to constrain the size and density

the observed synchrotron radiation spectrum, assuming that a fixed fraction of
the comoving proton power is instantaneously transformed into a power-law,
""shock""-like electron distribution function. This permits an analytic solution
for the case of a relativistic plasmoid with a constant internal magnetic
field. Breaks in the temporal behavior of the primary burst emission and long
wavelength afterglows occur on two time scales for external ISM density
distributions. The first represents the time when the outflow sweeps up
approximately M/G_0 of material from the ISM, where M is the mass in the
outflow ejecta and G_0 is the initial Lorentz factor of the plasmoid. The
second represents the time when synchrotron cooling begins strongly to regulate
the number of nonthemal electrons that are producing radiation which is
observed at a given energy.
  Results are applied to GRB and blazar variability. The slopes of the time
profiles of the X-ray and optical light cuves of the afterglows of GRB 970228

$s < 2$ in a deceleration regime near the radiative limit. We also propose that

interaction of a pulsar wind with the uniformly expanding supernova remnant by
means of numerical simulation. By performing two-dimensional numerical
simulations, we find three independent instabilities in the interaction region
between the pulsar wind and the expanding supernova remnant. The most important
instability develops as the shock driven by the pulsar bubble becomes
accelerated ($r \propto t^{6/5}$). The instability produces pronounced
filamentary structures that resemble the observed filaments in the Crab Nebula.
Our numerical simulations can reproduce important observational features of the
Crab Nebula. The high density heads in the R-T finger tips are produced because
of the compressibility of the gas. The density of these heads is found to be
about 10 times higher than other regions in the fingers. The mass contained in
the R-T fingers is found to be $60 % - 75 %$ of the total shocked mass and the
kinetic energy within the R-T fingers is $55 % - 72 %$ of the total kinetic
energy of the shocked flow. The R-T fingers are found to accelerate with a
slower rate than the shock front, which is consistent with the observations. By
comparing our simulations and the observations, we infer that the some
finger-like filaments (region F or G in Hester's observation) started to
develop about 657 years ago.

M101, which span a range in oxygen abundance of 0.7+-0.15 dex. A differential
analysis of the PL relations in V and I in the two fields yields a marginally
significant change in the inferred distance modulus on metal abundance, with
d(m-M)/d[O/H] = -0.24+-0.16 mag/dex. The trend is in the theoretically
predicted sense that metal-rich Cepheids appear brighter and closer than
metal-poor stars. External comparisons of Cepheid distances with those derived
from three other distance indicators, in particular the tip of the red giant
branch method, further constrain the magnitude of any Z-dependence of the PL
relation at V and I. The overall effects of any metallicity dependence on the

incorporating the full relativistic, polarized Compton redistribution matrix.
This allows us to explore a broad range of parameter space, in particular large
optical depths and/or low corona temperatures, for which the iterative
scattering method is very inefficient. Compared to Thomson scattering, Compton
scattering generally produces smaller polarizations for featureless spectra.
Distinct frequency-dependent patterns in polarization are produced near lines
and edges, which can be used as diagnostics for the corona. We discuss the
physics which gives rise to these results. Compton scattering can smear out
Lyman edges in total flux, and at the same time produce large increases in
polarization. This might help explain the steep rises in polarization observed
near the Lyman limit in some quasars.

al (1996) size function, suggests that the scale lengths of typical disks can
not have grown substantially with cosmic epoch since z=1, unless a
corresponding number of large disks have been destroyed through merging. In
addition to a roughly constant number density, the galaxies with large disks
have, as a set, properties consistent with the idea that they are similar
galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs. However, on average, they show
higher B-band disk surface brightnesses, bluer overall (U-V) colors, higher
[OII] 3727 equivalent widths and less regular morphologies at high redshift
than at low redshift, suggesting an increase in the star-formation rate by a
factor of about 3 to z=0.7. This is consistent with the expectations of recent
models for the evolution of the disk of the Milky Way and similar galaxies. The
evolution of the large disk galaxies is probably not sufficient to account for
the evolution of the overall luminosity function of galaxies over the interval
0<z<1, especially if Omega=1. Analysis of the half-light radii of all the
galaxies in the sample and construction of the bivariate size-luminosity
function suggests that larger changes in the galaxy population are due to
smaller galaxies, those with half-light radii around 5 h_{50}^{-1} kpc

Symmetric Object (CSO), 0710+439 at 5 GHz. Analysis of data spread over 13
years shows strong evidence for an increase in the separation of the outer
components at a rate of $0.251 \pm 0.029 h^{-1}c$. Dividing the overall size of
86.8 $h^{-1}$pc by this separation rate implies an estimated kinematic age of
only $1100 \pm 100$ yrs. After taking into account possible temporal variations
in hotspot advance speeds due to cloud collisions or hydrodynamic instabilities
we argue that the upper limit to the age of 0710+439 is most likely within a
factor of 2 of this estimate and certainly within a factor of 10 (i.e. $<11
000$ yrs). This result therefore strongly supports the idea that Compact
Symmetric Objects are very young radio-loud sources. Furthermore the large
radiative efficiency we calculate for 0710+439 is consistent with strong
negative luminosity evolution as CSOs grow in size and with them evolving into
classical double sources.

results of such a study constrained by a complete SO(10) model. The dominant
effects to the analysis come from third generation Yukawa couplings and a GUT
threshold to $\alpha_s$. We show that a small negative GUT correction to
$\alpha_s$ accommodates $\alpha_s(M_Z) \leq 0.118$ and $\delta m_b^{SUSY} > 0$.
The latter quantity being positive then opens up two options to fit the
measured rate for $b \to s\gamma$. The two distinct fits differ by the overall
sign of the amplitude for this process. They work equally well in complementary
regions of the allowed SUSY parameter space. We show plots of the partial
contributions to the coefficient $C_7(M_Z)$ in the ($m_0,M_{1/2}$) plane in
each of these best fits. We conclude that an attractive SO(10)-derived regime

been shown that Lorentz transformations are easily extended in Minkowski space

conservation fixes the relation between masses and velocities larger than c,
leading to the possible observation of negative mass squared particles from a
standard reference frame. Current data on neutrinos' mass square yeld negative
values, making neutrinos as possible candidates for having speed larger than c.
In this paper, an original analysis of the SN1987A supernova data is proposed.
It is shown that all the data measured in '87 by all the experiments are
consistent with the quantistic description of neutrinos as combination of
superluminal mass eigenstates. The well known enigma on the arrival times of
the neutrino bursts detected at LSD, several hours earlier than at IMB, K2 and

exhaustive search. The quantum mechanical algorithm for exhaustive search was
originally derived by using subtle properties of a particular quantum
mechanical operation called the Walsh-Hadamard (W-H) transform. This paper
shows that this algorithm can be implemented by replacing the W-H transform by
almost any quantum mechanical operation. This leads to several new applications
where it improves the number of steps by a square-root. It also broadens the
scope for implementation since it demonstrates quantum mechanical algorithms
that can readily adapt to available technology.
