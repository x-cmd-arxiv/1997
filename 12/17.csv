attempt to explain the empirical relation for dwarf nova outbursts between the

in the limit cycle model by the scaling with radius of the critical surface
density $\Sigma_{max}$ which triggers the dwarf nova outbursts. During the
storage phase of the instability the accretion disk mass must be less than some
maximum value, a value which scales with radius and therefore orbital period.
When the instability is triggered and the accumulated mass is redistributed
into a quasi steady state disk in outburst, the resultant peak optical flux
from the disk is a measure of the total mass which was stored in quiescence. We
compute light curves for a range in outer disk radius (or equivalently, orbital
period), and find that our peak values of $M_V$ are within $<1$ mag of the

galactic discs has opposite sign with respect to that resulting directly from
the sign of the Coriolis force. We estimate the rate of magnetic heating due to
the reconnection of magnetic flux tubes, which plays an important role in our
dynamo model. The corresponding luminosities of the diffuse X-ray emission are
consistent with the ROSAT observations of nearby galaxies. The present

attraction of the universe's mass density Omega_M from the effect of a possibly
inflationary pressure caused by a cosmological constant Lambda. We report here

this ``fuzz'' as starlight emission from the host galaxy, its location on the

similar to radio galaxies (RGs) or giant ellipticals (gEs). At higher redshifts
the detected host galaxies of RQs are more luminous than typical RGs and gEs,
although some weak detections or upper limits are consistent with a similar
fraction of RQs being hosted by galaxies with the expected luminosities for RGs

infrared luminosity indicating a direct link between the radio synchrotron
emission and the nuclear emission in K. This correlation is more tight for the

The energy input is provided by radioactive decay of Co-56, Co-57, and Ti-44.
The thermalization of the resulting gamma-rays and positrons is calculated by
solving the Spencer-Fano equation. Both the ionization and the individual level
populations are calculated time-dependently. Adiabatic cooling is included in
the energy equation. Charge transfer is important for determining the
ionization and is included with available and estimated rates. Full, multilevel
atoms are used for the observationally important ions. As input models to the
calculations we use explosion models for SN 1987A calculated by Woosley et al

evolution of the temperature and ionization of the various abundance zones. The
metal-rich core undergoes a thermal instability, often referred to as the
IR-catastrophe, at 600 - 1000 days. The hydrogen-rich zones evolve
adiabatically after 500 - 800 days, while in the helium region both adiabatic
cooling and line cooling are of equal importance after ~1000 days. Freeze-out
of the recombination is important in the hydrogen and helium zones. Concomitant
with the IR-catastrophe, the bulk of the emission shifts from optical and
near-IR lines to the mid- and far-IR. After the IR-catastrophe, the cooling is
mainly due to far-IR lines and adiabatic expansion. Dust cooling is likely to
be important in the zones where dust forms. We find that the dust condensation
temperatures occur later than ~500 days in the oxygen-rich zones, and the most

clearly in the [O I] 6300, 6364 lines. The distribution of the different zones,
and therefore the gamma-ray deposition, is determined from the line profiles of
the most important lines, where possible. We find the total mass of
hydrogen-rich gas to be ~7.7 Msun. The helium mass derived from the line fluxes
is sensitive to assumptions about the degree of redistribution in the line. The
mass of the helium dominated zone is consistent with ~1.9 Msun, with a further
~3.9 Msun of helium residing in the hydrogen component. Because of
uncertainties in the modeling of the non-thermal excitation of the [O I] lines,
the uncertainty in the oxygen mass is considerable. In addition, masses of
nitrogen, neon, magnesium, iron and nickel are estimated. The dominant
contribution to the line luminosity often originates in a different zone from
where most of the newly synthesized material resides. This applies to e.g.
carbon, calcium and iron. The [C I] lines, mainly arising in the helium zone,
indicate a substantially lower abundance of carbon mixed with helium than
stellar evolution models give, and a more extended zone with CNO processed gas
is indicated. The [Fe II] lines have in most phases a strong contribution from
primordial iron, and at t > 600 - 800 days this component dominates the [Fe II]
lines. The wings of the [Fe II] lines may therefore come from primordial iron,
rather than synthesized iron mixed to high velocity. Lines from ions with low

smooth hardening of the spectrum below 3 keV, and is probably produced by
material in the preshock column which overlies the X-ray emission region. The
ASCA data show that the intrinsic emission from the shock is not consistent
with a single temperature plasma. Significant iron L emission co-existing with
iron K shell lines from H and He-like iron clearly shows that there is a wide
range of temperatures present, as expected from a cooling shock structure. The
GINGA data give the best constraints on the maximum temperature emission in the

important, which supresses the highest temperature bremsstrahlung components,

analysis. For comparison with the PSCz data we also examine the genus of large
N-body simulations of four variants of the cold dark matter cosmogony. The
simulations are part of the Virgo project to simulate the formation of
structure in the Universe. We assume that the statistical properties of the
galaxy distribution can be identified with those of the dark matter particles
in the simulations. We extend the standard genus analysis by examining the
influence of sampling noise on the genus curve and introducing a statistic able
to quantify the amount of phase correlation present in the density field, the
""amplitude drop"" of the genus compared to a Gaussian field with identical power
spectrum. The results for PSCz are consistent with the hypothesis of
random-phase initial conditions. In particular, no strong phase correlation is
detected on scales ranging from 10 h^(-1)Mpc to 32 h^(-1)Mpc, whereas there is
a positive detection of phase correlation at smaller scales. Among the
simulations, phase correlations are detected in all models at small scales,
albeit with different strengths. when scaled to a common normalization, the
amplitude drop primarily depends on the shape of the power spectrum. We find

to the maximum radius of the disappearing region, the difference in time
structure is due to the time distribution of such radii. The observed relation
between the extent of the missing inner region of the disk and the duration of

parameterize the effects of new physics in these decays by two parameters: r_K
and \theta_K, with r_K=1 and \theta_K=0 in the Standard Model (SM). We show how
these parameters can be extracted from future data. This analysis offers some
insight in a possible violation of a ""golden relation"" between K \to \pi \nu
\bar \nu decays and the CP asymmetry in B \to \psi K_S in the SM pointed out
some time ago. We illustrate these ideas by considering a general class of
supersymmetric models. We find that in the ""constrained"" MSSM, in which
\theta_K=0, the measurements of Br(K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar \nu) and Br(K_L \to
\pi^0 \nu \bar \nu) directly determine the angle \beta. Moreover, the ""golden
relation"" remains unaffected. On the other hand, in general SUSY models with
unbroken R-parity the present experimental constraints still allow for
substantial deviations from r_K=1 and \theta_K=0. Typically 0.5 < r_K < 1.3 and
-25^0 < \theta_K < 25^0. Consequently, in these models the violation of the
""golden relation"" is possible and values for Br(K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar \nu) and
Br(K_L \to \pi^0 \nu \bar \nu) departing from the SM expectations by factors
2-3 cannot be excluded. Our conclusions differ in certain aspects from the ones

the context of anomalies in gauge theory. Differential forms were implicit in
physics at least as far back as Gauss (1833) (cf. his electro-magnetic
definition of the linking number), and more visibly in Dirac's magnetic
monopole (1931). The magnetic charge was given by the first Chern number. Thus
were characteristic classes (and by implication the cohomology of Lie algebras
and of Lie groups) introduced into physics. The `ghosts' introduced by Fade'ev
and Popov were incorporated into what came to be known as BRST cohomology.
Later the ghosts were reinterpreted as generators of the Chevalley-Eilenberg
complex for Lie algebra cohomology. Cohomological physics also makes use of
group theoretic cohomology, algebraic deformation theory and especially a novel
extension of homological algebra, combining Lie algebra cohomology with the
Koszul-Tate resolution, the major emphasis of the talk. This synergistic
combination of both kinds of cohomology appeared in the
Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach to the cohomological reduction of
constrained Poisson algebras. An analogous `odd' version was developed in the
Batalin-Vilkovisky approach to quantizing particle Lagrangians and Lagrangians
of string field theory. A revisionist view of the Batalin- Vilkovisky machinery
recognizes parts of it as a reconstruction of homological algebra with some
powerful new ideas undreamt of in that discipline.

reviews the steps by which these difficulties are surmounted, leading to a
generalized duality transform formulated in loop space. The significance of
this in relation to the Dualized Standard Model is explained, and possibly also
to some other areas.

possess a lifetime up to many years are localized in an outer potential well

present work extends the original analysis and studies the dependence of the
spectrum as a function of field strength and pseudomomentum over a wide range
of parameters. We predict that in the limit of large pseudomomentum, the ground
state of positronium atom in a magnetic field will become delocalized; for
strong fields, the binding energy of this state is quite large, resulting in a
ground state that is both stable against direct annihilation and against

intersection of the moving correlation volumes (those regions where the
