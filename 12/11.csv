formula for enumerating Euler classes which arise in the so-called local mirror
symmetry for some noncompact Calabi-Yau manifolds. At the end we interprete an
infinite dimensional transformation group, called the mirror group, acting on
Euler data, as a certain duality group of the linear sigma model.

One simulation suite, with a linear box size of 75 Mpc/h, is designed for high
resolution and good statistics on the group/poor cluster scale, and the other,
with a box size of 300 Mpc/h, is designed for good rich cluster statistics. All
runs had 57 million cold particles, and models with massive neutrinos had an
additional 113 million hot particles. We consider separately models with
massive neutrinos, tilt, curvature, and a nonzero cosmological constant in
addition to the standard CDM model. We find that our tilted
Omega+Omega_Lambda=1 (TLCDM) model produces too much small-scale power by a
factor of ~3, and our open Lambda=0 (OCDM) model also exceeds observed
small-scale power by a factor of 2. In addition, we take advantage of the large
dynamic range in detectable halo masses our simulations allow to check the
shape of the Press-Schechter approximation. We find good fits at cluster masses
for delta_c=1.27--1.35 for a Gaussian filter and delta_c=1.57--1.73 for a
tophat filter. However, Press-Schechter overpredicts the number density of
halos compared to the simulations in the high resolution suite by a weakly
cosmology-dependent factor of 1.5--2 at galaxy and group masses, which cannot
be fixed by adjusting delta_c within reasonable bounds. An appendix generalizes
the spherical collapse model to any isotropic cosmology.

disk. IRAS F12397+3333 and IRAS 13349+2438 show high polarization increasing to

they show optical reddening and rapid X-ray variability, but almost no cold

optical reddening indicators (such as the optical continuum slope and Balmer

reddening underpredicts the cold X-ray absorption, suggesting dusty warm
absorbers in all the highly polarized AGN. The existence of these

value as a result of the radial Lorentz force, but is constant on magnetic
surfaces. Angular momentum transport and energy dissipation in the disk are
parametrized by an alpha-prescription, and a Kramers opacity law is assumed to
hold. We also determine the stability of the equilibria with respect to the
magnetorotational (or Balbus-Hawley) instability. If the magnetic field is
sufficiently strong, stable equilibria can be found in which the angle of
inclination, i, of the magnetic field to the vertical at the surface of the
disk has any value in the range [0,90 degrees). By analyzing the dynamics of a
transonic outflow in the corona of the disk, we show that a certain potential
difference must be overcome even when i > 30 degrees. We determine this
potential difference as a function of i for increasing values of the vertical
magnetic field strength. For magnetorotationally stable equilibria, the
potential difference increases faster than the fourth power of the magnetic
field strength, quickly exceeding a value corresponding to the central
temperature of the disk, and is minimized with respect to i at i approximately
equal to 38 degrees. We show that this property is relatively insensitive to
the form of the opacity law. Our results suggest that an additional source of
energy, such as coronal heating, may be required for the launching of an
outflow from a magnetized disk.

simulations reveal behavior typical of metallic glasses and other viscoplastic
materials, specifically, reversible elastic deformation at small applied
stresses, irreversible plastic deformation at larger stresses, a stress
threshold above which unbounded plastic flow occurs, and a strong dependence of
the state of the system on the history of past deformations. Microscopic
observations suggest that a dynamically complete description of the macroscopic
state of this deforming body requires specifying, in addition to stress and
strain, certain average features of a population of two-state shear
transformation zones. Our introduction of these new state variables into the
constitutive equations for this system is an extension of earlier models of
creep in metallic glasses. In the treatment presented here, we specialize to
temperatures far below the glass transition, and postulate that irreversible
motions are governed by local entropic fluctuations in the volumes of the
transformation zones. In most respects, our theory is in good quantitative
agreement with the rich variety of phenomena seen in the simulations.

transitions in models with absorbing states. Sandpile models are found to
exhibit criticality only when a pair of relevant parameters - dissipation
epsilon and driving field h - are set to their critical values. The critical
values of epsilon and h are both equal to zero. The first is due to the absence
of saturation (no bound on energy) in the sandpile model, while the second
result is common to other absorbing-state transitions. The original definition
of the sandpile model places it at the point (epsilon=0, h=0+): it is critical
by definition. We argue power-law avalanche distributions are a general feature
of models with infinitely many absorbing configurations, when they are subject
to slow driving at the critical point. Our assertions are supported by
simulations of the sandpile at epsilon=h=0 and fixed energy density (no drive,
periodic boundaries), and of the slowly-driven pair contact process. We
formulate a field theory for the sandpile model, in which the order parameter
is coupled to a conserved energy density, which plays the role of an effective
creation rate.

here, with the help of an ab initio FP-LMTO approach, that for these elements
the electronic charge is unchanged from bulk to the surface, not only per site

order to achieve this orbital neutrality rule. Our results invalidate any
neutrality rule which would allow charge redistribution between orbitals to
ensure a common rigid shift for all of them. Moreover, in the case of Pd, the

successful in describing hard high energy processes because it contains
expected in QCD Color Coherent Phenomena. Within the model, which reproduces
Bjorken scaling and nuclear shadowing for deep inelastic processes, we
calculate $P_{\gamma}(\sigma,Q^2)$, the probability for the photon to interact
with a target with the cross section $\sigma$. We find that within the GVMD
model the virtual photon has two main components: the ''hard'' one with the
small cross section of the order of $1/Q^2$ and the high probability and the
''soft'' one with a typical hadronic cross section with the probability
suppressed by the factor of $1/Q^2$. Thus the GVDM model produces
$P_{\gamma}(\sigma,Q^2)$ similar to that within the parton model and suggests
the conspiracy between hard and soft QCD at $Q^2 > 1$ GeV$^2$.
  We study the limit $\sigma \to 0$ and show, that $P_{\gamma}(\sigma,Q^2)
\propto 1/ \sigma$ in both GVMD model and QCD. Thus similarly to the parton
model the GVMD model predicts the Color Transparency phenomenon. This is an
indirect indication that Bjorken scaling, Color Transparency and shadowing in
nuclei in DIS are closely related.

eight-brane of the Type IIA string theory, when the effects of gravity are
included. In particular, consider what happens when one allows the ten-form
field strength $F_{10}$ to vary discontinuously across the worldvolume of the
brane. Since the ten-form is constant on each side of the brane ($d*F_{10} =
0$), a variation in the bulk term $\int F_{10}*F_{10}$ gives rise to a net
pressure acting on the surface of the brane. This means that the infinite
`planar' eight-brane is no longer a static configuration with these boundary
conditions. Instead, a static configuration is found only when the brane
`compactifies' to the topology of an eight-sphere, $S^8$. These spherical
eight-branes are thus bubbles which form boundaries between different phases of
the massive Type IIA supergravity theory. While these bubbles are generically
unstable and will want to expand (or contract), we show that in certain cases
there is a critical radius, $r_c$, at which the (inward) tension of the brane
is exactly counterbalanced by the (outward) force exerted by the pressure
terms. Intuitively, these `compactified' branes are just spherical bubbles
where the effective cosmological constant jumps by a discrete amount as you
cross a brane worldsheet. We argue that these branes will be unstable to
various semi-classical decay processes. We discuss the implications of such
processes for the open strings which have endpoints on the eight-brane.

penetrating observation that both of them are quasi-Hopf algebras, obtained by
twisting the standard quantum affine algebra U_q(g). In this paper we present
an explicit formula for the twistors in the form of an infinite product of the
universal R matrix of U_q(g). We also prove the shifted cocycle condition for
the twistors, thereby completing Fronsdal's findings.
  This construction entails that, for generic values of the deformation
parameters, representation theory for U_q(g) carries over to the elliptic
algebras, including such objects as evaluation modules, highest weight modules
and vertex operators. In particular, we confirm the conjectures of Foda et al.
concerning the elliptic algebra A_{q,p}(^sl_2).

needed to implement quantum logic is not always independent of dissipation. The
limitations these dissipative influences present will be described and the need
for efficient error correction noted. Even if long and involved quantum
computations turn out to be hard to realize, one can perform interesting
