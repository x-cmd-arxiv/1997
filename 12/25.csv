  rmisra@iucaa.ernet.in",,"10.1086/305645",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the Iron K emission line from MCG-6-30-15 could be broadened due
to Comptonization by a surrounding highly ionized cloud with radius $\sim
10^{14}$ cms. We calculate the temperature of the cloud to be $\sim0.21\kev$,
provided a reasonable estimate of the UV flux is made. The X-ray/$\gamma$-ray
emission observed from the source is compatible with this model. Such a cloud
should be highly ionized and strong absorption edges are not expected from the
source (Fabian et al 1995).
  For a $\onlyten{6}\msol$ black hole the size of the could corresponds to
about 300 Schwarzschild radius. The intrinsic line could then be emitted far
from the black hole and gravitational red-shift and Doppler effects would be
negligible. If the black hole mass is much larger than $\onlyten{6}\msol$,
gravitational/Doppler red-shifts would also contribute significantly to the
broadening.
  We argue that the broad red wing observed in the source does not by itself
imply emission from regions close ($R < 5 r_s$) to the black hole. However,
Comptonization cannot produce a double peak. The presence of such a feature is
a clear sign of inner disk emission influenced by gravitational and Doppler
effects, perhaps broadened by the Comptonization. We note that simultaneous
broad band (2-100 keV) study of this source can also reveal (or rule out) the
presence of such a Comptonizing cloud.

  Application of Recurrence Quantification Analysis","8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Intl. J. Chaos Theory Applications",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  A methodology based upon recurrence quantification analysis is proposed for
the study of orthographic structure of written texts. Five different
orthographic data sets (20th century Italian poems, 20th century American
poems, contemporary Swedish poems with their corresponding Italian
translations, Italian speech samples, and American speech samples) were
subjected to recurrence quantification analysis, a procedure which has been
found to be diagnostically useful in the quantitative assessment of ordered
series in fields such as physics, molecular dynamics, physiology, and general
signal processing. Recurrence quantification was developed from recurrence
plots as applied to the analysis of nonlinear, complex systems in the physical
sciences, and is based on the computation of a distance matrix of the elements
of an ordered series (in this case the letters consituting selected speech and
poetic texts). From a strictly mathematical view, the results show the
possibility of demonstrating invariance between different language exemplars
despite the apparent low-level of coding (orthography). Comparison with the
actual texts confirms the ability of the method to reveal recurrent structures,
and their complexity. Using poems as a reference standard for judging speech
complexity, the technique exhibits language independence, order dependence and
freedom from pure statistical characteristics of studied sequences, as well as
consistency with easily identifiable texts. Such studies may provide
phenomenological markers of hidden structure as coded by the purely
orthographic level.

dephasing -- reversible damping of the low energy collective modes of a

This rate is characterized by a steep temperature dependence, and it is weakly
amplitude dependent.
  In the limit of large numbers of bosons forming the condensate, the rate
approaches zero. However, for the numbers employed by the JILA group, the
calculated value of the rate is close to the experimental one. We suggest that
a reversible nature of the damping caused by the thermal dephasing in the
isotropic trap can be tested by the echo effect. A reversible nature of Landau
damping is also discussed, and a possibility of observing the echo effect in an
anisotropic trap is considered as well. The parameters of the echo are

an anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry and an effective mass term m ~ 1TeV of certain
relevant fields has been proposed. In this paper we examine whether such a
mechanism can emerge in superstring derived free fermionic models. We observe
that certain three generation string solutions, though not all, lead to an
anomalous U(1) which couples universally to all three families. The advantages
of this three-family universality of $U(1)_A$, compared to the two-family case,
proposed in earlier works, in yielding squark degeneracy, while avoiding
radiative breaking of color and charge, are noted. The root cause of the flavor
universality of $U(1)_A$ is the cyclic permutation symmetry that characterizes
the $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold compactification with standard embedding, realized
in the free fermionic models by the NAHE set. It is shown that
non--renormalizable terms which contain hidden--sector condensates, generate
the required suppression of the relevant mass term $m$, compared to the Planck
scale. While the D-term of the family universal $U(1)_A$ leads to squark
degeneracy, those of the family dependent U(1)'s, remarkably enough, are found
to vanish for the solutions considered, owing to minimization of the potential.

more general dynamical systems.

basic hypergeometric ${}_6\psi_6$ summation formula and its Dougall type
${}_5H_5$ hypergeometric degeneration for $q\to 1$ is studied. The multiple
Bailey sum amounts to an extension corresponding to the case of a nonreduced
root system of certain summation identities associated to the reduced root
systems that were recently conjectured by Aomoto and Ito and proved by
Macdonald. By truncation, we obtain multidimensional analogues of the
very-well-poised unilateral (basic) hypergeometric Rogers ${}_6\phi_5$ and
Dougall ${}_5F_4$ sums (both nonterminating and terminating). The terminating
sums may be used to arrive at product formulas for the norms of recently
introduced ($q$-)Racah polynomials in several variables.

nuclear level densities we find that quantal fluctuation corrections (RPA) are
important even up to temperature $T = 2.0 MeV$. This leads to a good agreement
between calculated numbers and the available experimental data for $^{104}Pd$
and $^{114}Sn$, particularly the excitation energy ($E^*$) dependence.
Furthermore, we also argue that $a=S^2/4E^*$ is the only correct definition of
the level density parameter in the present context which is also consistent
with the Bethe like level density formula.

these results cannot be extrapolated to very high-energy phenomena: this new
domain of physics may actually provide the key to the, yet unsettled, question
of the ether and the absolute rest frame. Introducing a critical distance
scale, a, below 10E-25 cm (the wavelength scale of the highest-energy observed
cosmic rays) allows to consider models, compatible with standard tests of
special relativity, where a small violation of Lorentz symmetry (a can, for
instance, be the Planck length) leads to a deformed relativistic kinematics
(DRK) producing dramatic effects on the properties of very high-energy cosmic
rays. For instance, the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff does no longer
apply and particles which are unstable at low energy (neutron, some hadronic
resonances like the Delta++, possibly several nuclei...) become stable at very
high energy. In these models, an absolute local rest frame exists (the vacuum
rest frame, VRF) and special relativity is a low-momentum limit. We discuss the
possible effects of Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) on kinematics and
dynamics, as well as the cosmic-ray energy range (well below the energy scale
associated to the fundamental length) and experiments (on earth and from space)
where they could be detected.
