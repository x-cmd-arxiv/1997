constrain the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR) history. We use a
spectrophotometric model of galaxy evolution which provides a self-consistent
description of global properties of local galaxies. We have chosen two CSFR
histories, with and without dust extinction, both normalized in order to
reproduce the observed comoving luminosity densities at different wavelengths.
We show that as expected, the SNII rates provide a direct measurement of the
instantaneous CSFR, whereas the SNIa rate depends on the CSFR history during
the past few Gyrs. Therefore the SNIa rate detected up to $z {\sim}$ 1 is able
to provide new insight on the CSFR at higher redshift. The comparison with the
data are in good agreement with both local and high-$z$ measurement and
provides an additional evidence of the validity of the CSFR up to $z$ = 1, but
suggests values at $z >$ 1 higher than those of Madau et al. (1996) and
consistent with the presence of extinction. We also show that Type Ia supernova
observations at $z{\sim}$ 1 can already put constraints on the still puzzling
nature of Type Ia progenitors.

increasing the recombination time and raising the local ion pressure. In the

(z=0.042). We present photometric and spectroscopic observations for both the
dominant galaxy and the arc. The mass distribution in A3408 is modeled by
scaled versions of the representative distributions derived from studies of
clusters at higher redshifts. The two gravitational potentials considered are:
i) a ``minimum'' mass case where the mass distribution follows the light
profile of the central elliptical galaxy and, ii) a ``maximum'' mass case where
a typical massive dark halo is added to the previous case. The observed arc is
well reproduced by both models, but rather small magnifications of the source
galaxy are implied. The source galaxy is tentatively identified in both the
lensing and non-lensing scenarios as being a spiral. The smaller lensed spiral
(14.6 h_50^{-1} kpc, M_B=-18.2) predicted by the dark halo model appears to fit
the observations marginally better. Furthermore, we found that only the dark
halo model predicts a measurable amount of weak shear in the images of faint
background galaxies. We conclude that observations, under very good seeing
conditions, of week shear in faint background galaxies in the direction of
low-redshift galaxy clusters are possible. When the latter are combined with
X-ray data, a powerful tool to probe the mass distribution in the very central

HI-SX. The gas associated with the main body, HI-A, has a steep velocity
gradient; although our analysis is hindered by poor spatial resolution relative
to the extent of the system, the main body appears to be undergoing solid body
rotation. The optical condensation to the northwest of IZw18 is embedded in the
common HI envelope, and is found to be kinematically separate from the main
body (HI-C). The interbody gas, HI-I, connects HI-A and HI-C. Finally, a large
diffuse, kinematically distinct, gas component extends at least 1 arcmin to the
south of the main body (HI-SX), with no known optical counterpart. The peak of
the gas column density coincides with the SE HII region in the main body; two
other HI peaks are associated with the NW HII region and an HII region in the

cosmological tool. While the present--day abundance of X-ray clusters is
degenerate in $\sigma_8$, $n$ and $\Omega_0$, Oukbir and Blanchard (1992, 1997)
have pointed out that the number density evolution of X-ray clusters with
redshift can be used to determine $\Omega_0$. Here, we clarify the origin of
this statement by identifying those parameters to which the evolution of
cluster number density is most sensitive. We find that the evolution is
controlled by only two parameters: the amplitude of fluctuations, $\sigma_M$,
on the scale associated with the mass under consideration, $R = 9.5h^{1/3}
\Omega_0^{-1/3}$ $ M_{15}^{1/3} h^{-1}$Mpc, and the cosmological background
density, $\Omega_0$. In contrast, evolution is remarkably insensitive to the
slope of the power spectrum. We verify that the number density evolution of
clusters is a powerful probe of the mean density of the universe, under the
condition that $\sigma_M$ is chosen to reproduce current-day abundances.
Comparison of the cluster abundance at $z \sim 0.5-0.6$, from the EMSS, to the
present-day abundance, from the ROSAT BCS sample, unambiguously reveals the
existence of significant negative evolution. This number evolution, in
conjunction with the absence of any negative evolution in the
luminosity-temperature relation, provides robust evidence in favor of a
critical density universe ($\Omega_0=1$), in agreement with the analysis by
Sadat et al. (1998).

variety of cosmogonies show that the density profiles of dark matter halos are
universal, with low mass halos being denser than their more massive
counterparts. This mass-density correlation is interpreted as reflecting the
earlier typical formation time of less massive objects. We investigate this
hypothesis in the light of formation times defined as the epoch at which halos
experience their last major merger. Such halo formation times are calculated by
means of a modification of the extended Press & Schechter formalism which
includes a phenomenological frontier, Delta_m, between tiny and notable
relative mass captures leading to the distinction between merger and accretion.
For Delta_m=0.6, we confirm that the characteristic density of halos is
essentially proportional to the mean density of the universe at their time of
formation. Yet, proportionality with respect to the critical density yields
slightly better results for open universes. In addition, we find that the scale
radius of halos is also essentially proportional to their virial radius at the
time of formation.
  We show that these two relations are consistent with the following simple
scenario. Violent relaxation caused by mergers rearranges the structure of
halos leading to the same density profile with universal values of the
dimensionless characteristic density and scale radius. Between mergers, halos
grow gradually through the accretion of surrounding layers by keeping their
central parts steady and expanding their virial radius as the critical density
of the universe diminishes.

of nested peaks. Here, we seek to verify this suspicion by implementing a more

seen in previous ground-based monitoring. Unlike the case of GRB970228, no
nebulosity is detected surrounding the OT of GRB970508, although Mg I
absorption and [O II] emission seen in Keck spectra at a redshift of z = 0.835
suggest the presence of a dense, star-forming medium. The HST observations set
very conservative upper limits of R ~24.5 and H ~22.2 on the brightness of any
underlying extended source. If this subtends a substantial fraction of an
arcsecond, then the R band limit is ~25.5. Subsequent photometry suggests a
flattening of the light curve at later epochs. Assuming the OT decline follows
a pure power-law and ascribing the flattening to the presence of an underlying
component of constant flux, we find that this must have R = 25.4, consistent
with the upper limits determined by HST. At z = 0.8, this would correspond to
an absolute magnitude in the U band of ~-18, similar to that of the Large

the functional form are obtained by fitting to a set of ab initio results from
quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory in the local
density approximation, which include various bulk phases and defect structures.
We test the potential by applying it to the relaxation of point defects, core
properties of partial dislocations and the structure of disordered phases, none
of which are included in the fitting procedure. For dislocations, our model
makes predictions in excellent agreement with ab initio and tight-binding
calculations. It is the only potential known to describe both the 30$^\circ$-

thermodynamic properties of the liquid and amorphous phases are also in good
agreement with experimental and ab initio results. Our potential is the first
capable of simulating a quench directly from the liquid to the amorphous phase,
and the resulting amorphous structure is more realistic than with existing
empirical preparation methods. These advances in transferability come with no
extra computational cost, since force evaluation with our model is faster than
with the popular potential of Stillinger-Weber, thus allowing reliable
atomistic simulations of very large atomic systems.

focus of the paper is placed on the latter. The variation $\omega$ with respect
to the Brans-Dicke field is based on higher-order corrections analogous to
those of the dilaton field in string theory, following the simple principle
that the Brans-Dicke and metric fields decouple asymptotically. The question
addressed is whether a large value of $\omega$ is predominant in most regions
of the universe, which would lead to the conclusion that a typical region is
then governed by General Relativity. In these theories we find that it is
possible to construct inflaton potentials that drive the evolution of the
Brans-Dicke field to an appropriate range of values at the end of inflation,
such that a large $\omega$ is indeed typical in an average region of the
universe. However, in general this conclusion does not hold and it is shown
that for a wide class of inflaton potentials General Relativity is not a priori
a typical theory.

semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS), $e p \to e' X h$, gradually
decreases from $Q^{2}$, the photon virtuality which determines the hard scale
in the virtual photon (current) fragmentation region to a soft, hadronic, scale
in the proton fragmentation region. This suggests similarity of the inclusive
spectra of leading protons and neutrons, $h=p,n$, in high energy hadron-proton
and virtual photon-proton collisions. We explore this similarity extending to
the DIS regime the nonperturbative peripheral mechanisms of inelastic
scattering traditionally used in hadronic interactions to explain fast nucleons
production. While the production of leading neutrons is known to be exhausted
by DIS off charged pions, the production of leading protons by DIS off neutral
pions must be supplemented by a substantial contribution from isoscalar reggeon
($f_{0}$) exchange extrapolated down to moderate values of $x_{L}$. We comment
on the $x$ and $Q^{2}$ dependence of leading proton production as a probe of a
universal pattern of the $x,Q^{2}$ evolution of the nucleon and meson (reggeon)
structure functions at small $x$.

the existence of Higgs fields and of exactly 3 generations of fermions, while
giving at the same time the observed fermion mass hierarchy together with a
tree-level CKM matrix equal to the identity matrix. It further suggests a
method for generating from loop corrections the lower generation masses and
nondiagonal CKM matrix elements. In this paper, the proposed calculation is
carried out to 1-loop. It is found first that with the method suggested one can
account readily for the masses of the second generation fermions as a `leakage'
from the highest generation. Then, with the Yukawa couplings fixed by fitting
the masses of the 2 higher generations, one is left with only 2 free parameters
to evaluate the CKM matrix and the masses in the lowest generation. One obtains
a very good fit to the CKM matrix and sensible values for the masses of $d$ and
$e$, though, for a valid reason, not of $u$. In addition, the fitted values of
the Yukawa couplings and vacuum expectation values of the dual colour Higgs
fields show remarkable features perhaps indicative of a deeper significance.

The equations of motion for the D-brane and the gauge field are derived from
the conformal invariance condition on the string world sheet in lowest order of
$\ap$. The ordering problem of the involved matrices is solved. In addition to
our previous work we discuss a conflict between the classical T-duality rules

effects and from the movement towards asymptotic freedom at high densities.
Subthreshold $K^-$-meson production by the KaoS collaboration at GSI shows that
the $K^-$-mass must be substantially lowered, by $\gtrsim$ 200 MeV at $\rho\sim
2\rho_0$. It is shown that explicit chiral symmetry breaking through the kaon
mass may be responsible for $\Sigma^-$-nucleon and $\Xi^-$-nucleon scalar
attraction being weaker than obtained by simple quark scaling. The normal mode
of the strangeness minus, charge $e^-$, excitation is constructed as a linear
combination of $K^-$-meson and $\Sigma^-$, neutron-hole state. Except for zero

correlated with the corresponding binding energies. Above the peak region only
the difference between potentials with or without p-wave contributions remains
relevant. In the differential cross sections the electric quadrupole
contributions have to be taken into account. The remarkable agreement between
theory and experiment in $p$-$d$ radiative capture is achieved only when
incorporating this contribution, together with most of the above-mentioned
