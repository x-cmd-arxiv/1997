approach, which involves the dbar-method, avoids moving arguments and gives
much stronger results. In particular, it is proved that if X and Y are
connected smooth projective varieties of positive dimension and f is a
holomorphic immersion of Y into X with ample normal bundle, then the image of
the fundamental group of Y in that of X is of finite index. This result is
obtained as a consequence of a direct generalization of Nori's theorem. The
second part concerns a new approach to the theorem of Burns which states that a
quotient of the unit ball in complex Euclidean space (of dimension at least 3)
by a discrete group of automorphisms which has a strongly pseudoconvex boundary
component has only finitely many ends. The following generalization is
obtained. If a complete Hermitian manifold X of dimension at least 3 has a
strongly pseudoconvex end E and the Ricci curvature of X is bounded above by a
negative constant, then, away from E, X has finite volume.

bound-state factor related to the b-quark distribution function in the B-meson.
The non-perturbative meson structure is described through various quark-model
wave functions, constructed via the Hamiltonian light-front formalism using as
input both relativized and non-relativistic potential models. A link between
spectroscopic quark models and the B-meson decay physics is obtained in this
way. Our predictions for the B -> X_c l nu_l and B -> X_u l nu_l decays are
used to extract the CKM parameters |V_cb| and |V_ub| from available inclusive
data. After averaging over the various quark models adopted and including
leading-order perturbative QCD corrections, we obtain |V_cb| = (43.0 +/-
0.7_exp +/- 1.8_th) 10^-3 and |V_ub| = (3.83 +/- 0.48_exp +/- 0.14_th) 10^-3,
implying |V_ub / V_cb| = 0.089 +/- 0.011_exp +/- 0.005_th, in nice agreement
with existing predictions.

smooth large-N limit of fundamental-representation Wilson loops and find, as
expected, confinement. Extending an earlier work by the author, we construct
the adjoint Wilson-loop potential in this d=2 model for all N, as an expansion
in powers of $\rho/M^2$, where $\rho$ is the vortex density per unit area and M
is the vortex inverse size, and find, as expected, screening. The leading term
of the adjoint potential shows a roughly linear regime followed by string
breaking when the potential energy is about 2M. This leading potential is a
universal (N-independent at fixed fundamental string tension $K_F$) of the form
$(K_F/M)U(MR)$, where R is the spacelike dimension of a rectangular Wilson
loop. The linear-regime slope is not necessarily related to $K_F$ by Casimir
scaling. We show that in d=2 the dilute vortex model is essentially equivalent
to true d=2 QCD, but that this is not so for adjoint representations; arguments
to the contrary are based on illegal cumulant expansions which fail to
represent the necessary periodicity of the Wilson loop in the vortex flux. Most
of our arguments are expected to hold in d=3,4 also.

  Nuclei, Sanibel Island, Florida (November 10-15, 1997)",,,,"nucl-th astro-ph",,"  All of the actinides and roughly half the natural abundance of elements with
mass number A > 70 come from the rapid neutron capture process, or the
r-process. If the r-process, as suggested by many, occurs deep in a supernova,
then it is under the influence of an intense neutrino flux. Here we discuss the
effects of both charged-current and neutral-current neutrino interactions on
the r-process. We show that the multiple-neutron emission induced by both kinds
of neutrino interactions can affect the observed r-process abundance pattern
significantly. In particular, we find that five nuclei below the r-process
abundance peak at A = 195 may be entirely attributed to the neutrino-induced
neutron spallation processes following the r-process freeze-out. Furthermore,
the deduced neutrino fluence agrees with the conditions in the recent supernova
r-process model. These results strongly argue that the r-process occurs in
supernovae. They also provide a sensitive probe for the conditions at the
supernova r-process site.
