computing Gromov-Witten invariants of rational curves via specializations of
GKZ-hypergeometric series.

Now that it is apparent that our universe began in a Big Bang explosion, the
question of what happened before the Big Bang arises. Inflation seems like a
very promising answer, but as Borde and Vilenkin have shown, the inflationary
state preceding the Big Bang must have had a beginning also. Ultimately, the
difficult question seems to be how to make something out of nothing. This paper
explores the idea that this is the wrong question --- that that is not how the
Universe got here. Instead, we explore the idea of whether there is anything in
the laws of physics that would prevent the Universe from creating itself.
Because spacetimes can be curved and multiply connected, general relativity
allows for the possibility of closed timelike curves (CTCs). Thus, tracing
backwards in time through the original inflationary state we may eventually
encounter a region of CTCs giving no first-cause. This region of CTCs, may well
be over by now (being bounded toward the future by a Cauchy horizon). We
illustrate that such models --- with CTCs --- are not necessarily inconsistent
by demonstrating self-consistent vacuums for Misner space and a multiply
connected de Sitter space in which the renormalized energy-momentum tensor does
not diverge as one approaches the Cauchy horizon and solves Einstein's
equations. We show such a Universe can be classically stable and
self-consistent if and only if the potentials are retarded, giving a natural
explanation of the arrow of time. Some specific scenarios (out of many possible
ones) for this type of model are described. For example: an inflationary
universe gives rise to baby universes, one of which turns out to be itself.
Interestingly, the laws of physics may allow the Universe to be its own mother.

4U1820-30, GX5-1 and etc) in terms of dynamics of the centrifugal barrier, a
hot boundary region surrounding a neutron star. We demonstrate that this region
may experience the relaxation oscillations, and that the displacements of a gas
element both in radial and vertical directions occur at the same main
frequency, of order of the local Keplerian frequency. We show the importance of
the effect of a splitting of the main frequency produced by the Coriolis force
in a rotating disk for the interpretation of a spacing between the QPO peaks.
We estimate a magnitude of the splitting effect and present a simple formula
for the whole spectrum of the split frequencies. It is interesting that the
first three lowest-order overtones fall in the range of 200-1200 Hz and match
the kHz-QPO frequencies observed by RXTE. Similar phenomena should also occur
in Black Hole (BH) systems, but, since the QPO frequency is inversely
proportional to the mass of a compact object, the frequency of the
centrifugal-barrier oscillations in the BH systems should be a factor of 5-10
lower than that for the NS systems. The X-ray spectrum formed in this region is
a result of upscattering of a soft radiation (from a disk and a NS surface) off
relatively hot electrons in the boundary layer. We also briefly discuss some
alternative QPO models, including a possibility of acoustic oscillations in the
boundary layer, the proper stellar rotation, and g-mode disk oscillations.

exact solution of the evolution of $\gamma$-ray burst remnants, including the
radiative losses. We show that in general the evolution of bulk Lorentz factor
$\gamma$ satisfies $\gamma \propto t^{-\alpha_{t}}$ when $\gamma \gg 1$, here
$\alpha_{t}$ is mainly in the range $9/22 \sim 3/8$, the latter corresponds to
adiabatic expansion. So it is clear that adiabatic expansion is a good
approximation even when radiative loss is considered. However, in fact,
$\alpha_{t}$ is slightly larger than 3/8, which may have some effects on a
detailed data analysis. Synchrotron-self-absorption is also calculated and it
is demonstrated that the radio emission may become optically thin during the
afterglow. Our solution can also apply to the nonrelativistic case ($\gamma

states. Precise numerical agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking area formula
for the entropy is found. The result pertains to any consistent quantum theory
of gravity, and does not use string theory or supersymmetry.

is specified by two types of data: first, a consistent collection of reflection
coefficients for bulk fields on the disk; and second, a choice of an
automorphism $\omega$ of the fusion rules that preserves conformal weights.
Non-trivial automorphisms $\omega$ correspond to D-brane configurations for
arbitrary conformal field theories. The choice of the fusion rule automorphism
$\omega$ amounts to fixing the dimension and certain global topological
features of the D-brane world volume and the background gauge field on it. We
present evidence that for fixed choice of $\omega$ the boundary conditions are
classified as the irreducible representations of some commutative associative
algebra, a generalization of the fusion rule algebra. Each of these irreducible
representations corresponds to a choice of the moduli for the world volume of
the D-brane and the moduli of the flat connection on it.

travel time between the source and observer decreases with time. Astrophysical
applications of special relativity complement idealized examples with real
applications and very effectively exemplify the role of a finite light travel
time.
