between flat vector bundles over a compact Riemann surface having a prescribed
Weil divisor (i.e., having prescribed zeros and poles with directional as well
as multiplicity information included in the vector case). This new formalism
unifies the earlier approach of Ball-Clancey (in the setting of trivial bundles
over an abstract Riemann surface) with an earlier approach of the authors
(where the Riemann surface was assumed to be the normalizing Riemann surface
for an algebraic curve embedded in ${\bold C}^2$ with determinantal
representation, and the vector bundles were assumed to be presented as the
kernels of linear matrix pencils). The main tool is a version of the Cauchy
kernel appropriate for flat vector bundles over the Riemann surface. Our
formula for the interpolating bundle map (in the special case of a single zero
and a single pole) can be viewed as a generalization of the Fay trisecant
identity from the usual line bundle case to the vector bundle case in terms of
Cauchy kernels. In particular we obtain a new proof of the Fay trisecant
identity.

  Symposium, eds Meegan, Preece, Koshut",,,"LAUR 97-5163","astro-ph",,"  Many cosmological models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) assume that a single
relativistic shell carries kinetic energy away from the source and later
converts it into gamma rays, perhaps by interactions with the interstellar
medium or by shocks within the shell. We investigate methods of achieving the
observed variability using symmetry. Since our model emphasizes geometric and
statistical considerations, rather than the detailed physics of the shell, it
is applicable to any theory that relies on relativistic shells. In order to
achieve the observed variability in GRBs using a single-shell model, we have
found that the gamma-ray emission must occur from small patches on the shell
(entities). We have derived two significant characteristics of the time
histories expected from such a model. First, the average number of entities
contributing to the signal remains constant throughout much of the time
history, although the overall photon flux decreases due to relativistic
effects. Second, the ""peaks"" in a time history can be ascribed to Poisson
variations in the actual number of entities contributing to the signal at any
given time. Taken together, these properties imply that the relative variations
in a GRB (i.e. the heights of the peaks relative to the average envelope of the
signal) should remain constant throughout a time history.

($2-500$ keV) spectrum of Cygnus X-1 from OSSE and Ginga observations. In this
model, the spectrum is produced by saturated Comptonization within the inner
region of the accretion disk, where the temperature varies rapidly with radius.
In an earlier attempt, we demonstrated the viability of this model by fitting
the data from EXOSAT, XMPC balloon and OSSE observations, though these were not
made simultaneously. Since the source is known to be variable, however, the
results of this fit were not conclusive. In addition, since only once set of
observations was used, the good agreement with the data could have been a
chance occurrence. Here, we improve considerably upon our earlier analysis by
considering four sets of simultaneous observations of Cygnus X-1, using an
empirical model to obtain the disk temperature profile. The vertical structure
is then obtained using this profile and we show that the analysis is self-
consistent. We demonstrate conclusively that the transition disk spectrum is a
better fit to the observations than that predicted by the soft photon
Comptonization model. Since the temperature profile is obtained by fitting the
data, the unknown viscosity mechanism need not be specified. The disk structure
can then be used to infer the viscosity parameter $\alpha$, which appears to
vary with radius and luminosity. This behavior can be understood if $\alpha$
depends intrinsically on the local parameters such as density, height and
temperature. However, due to uncertainties in the radiative transfer,
quantitative statements regarding the variation of $\alpha$ cannot yet be made.

in the line bisector with the radial velocity period would provide strong
evidence in support of rotational modulation or stellar pulsations as the cause
of the 643-day period. A lack of any bisector variability at this period would
support the planet hypothesis. Variations in the line asymmetries are found

that this 50-day period is consistent with an m=4 nonradial sectoral g-mode

variability stems from the reflex motion of the central star due to a planetary
companion having a mass of 11 Jupiter masses. However, this long-period

quantified using spectral line bisectors and line residuals. We detect no

line residuals. Comparisons of the data to the bisector and residual variations
expected for nonradial pulsations indicate that we can exclude those sectoral
nonradial modes having m>2 and all sectoral modes with k>1, where k is the
ratio of the horizontal to vertical velocities for the pulsations. The lack of
line shape variability and the 469 m/s radial velocity amplitude is still
consistent with nonradial sectoral modes m=1, and possibly m=2, but with k~1,
which is at least 3 orders of magnitude less than the predicted value given the

a very useful age diagnostic for future studies of the intermediate-age

orbital periods, like the planet around 51 Peg. These planets were detected
using the indirect technique of measuring variations in the Doppler shifts of
lines in the spectra of the primary stars. But it is possible that oscillations
of the stars themselves (or other effects) could mimic the signature of the
planets, particularly around the short-period planets. The apparent lack of
spectral and brightness variations, however, led to widespread acceptance that
there is a planet around 51 Peg. This conclusion was challenged by the
observation of systematic variations in the line profile shapes of 51 Peg,
which suggested stellar oscillations. If these observations are correct, then
there is no need to invoke a planet around 51 Peg to explain the data. Here we
report observations of 51 Peg at a much higher spectral resolution than those

radial mass segregation and unresolved binaries, would steepen the true IMF
relative to the apparent IMF. Several cases of apparently large variations in
cluster IMFs are pointed out, and a graphical comparison of results for about
60 clusters shows a spread of at least unity in the logarithmic IMF index for
all mass ranges above about 1 $M_{\sun}$. I conclude that either: 1. The
uncertainties are so large that very little can be said about an average IMF or
IMF variations; or 2. If the observations are taken at face value, there are
strong indications of IMF variations, which do not seem to correlate with
obvious environmental conditions like metallicity or stellar density. If there
is an average IMF, I suggest that it is steepest at intermediate masses. If the
variations are real, they offer a useful test of theoretical models.

model with large core radius. Another important development concerns new
detectors, both space- and ground-based, which will cover the window between 50

new calculations of the $\gamma$-ray line signal (a sharp spike of $10^{-3}$
relative width) from neutralino annihilations have revealed a hitherto
neglected contribution which, for heavy higgsino-like neutralinos, gives an
annihilation rate an order of magnitude larger than previously predicted. We
make a detailed phenomenological study of the possible detection rates given
these three pieces of new information. We show that the proposed upgrade of the
Whipple telescope will make it sensitive to a region of parameter space, with
substantial improvements possible with the planned new generation of Air
Cherenkov Telescope Arrays. We also comment on the potential of the GLAST

Survey to investigate the effects of environment on the rate of star formation

sample, for the first time, the entire range of galactic environment, from the
voids to the clusters, in a uniform manner, thus, we could decouple the local
galaxy density from the membership in associations. This decoupling is very
crucial for constraining the physical processes responsible for the
environmental dependencies of SFR. On the other hand, the use of an
automatically-measured concentration index (C), rather than Hubble type, allows
us to cleanly separate the morphological component from the SFR vs. environment
relationship. We find that cluster galaxies exhibit lower SFR for the same C
than field galaxies, while a further division of clusters by `richness' reveals
a new possible excitation of `starbursts' in poor clusters. Meanwhile, a more
general environmental investigation reveals that the SFR of a given C shows a
continuous correlation with the local density. Interestingly, this trend is
also observed both inside and outside of clusters, implying that physical
processes responsible for this correlation might not be intrinsic to the
cluster environment. On the other hand, galaxies with differing levels of SFR
appear to respond differently to the local density. Low levels of SFR are more
sensitive to environment inside than outside of clusters. In contrast, high
levels of SFR, identified as ``starbursts'', are as sensitive to local density
in the field as in clusters. We conclude that at least two separate processes

10 to 1000 AU from the point where the explosive energy is initially released.
To account for the observed duration and variability of the gamma-ray emission
in most GRBs, a central engine powering the shocks must remain active for
several seconds to many minutes but must strongly fluctuate in its output on
much shorter timescales. We show how a neutron star differentially rotating at
millisecond periods (DROMP) could be such an engine. A magnetized DROMP would
repeatedly wind up toroidal magnetic fields to about 10**17 G and only release
the corresponding magnetic energy, when each buoyant magnetic field torus
floats up to, and breaks through, the stellar surface. The resulting rapid
sub-bursts, separated by relatively quiescent phases, repeat until the kinetic
energy of differential rotation is exhausted by these events. Calculated values
of the energy released and of the various timescales are in agreement with
observations of GRBs. The baryon loading in each sub-burst may also be
consistent with theoretical requirements for a blast wave capable of giving the
X-ray, optical and radio afterglows recently observed from cosmological
distances. DROMPs could be created in several kinds of astrophysical events;
some of these would be expected to occur at about the observed GRB rate. The
requisite differential rotation could be imparted to neutron stars as they are
born or at the end of their existence: some DROMPs may be created close to star
forming regions while others may arise far from galaxies.

  Speakers' Utterances in Spoken Dialog","280 pages, doctoral dissertation (latex with postscript figures)",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  In this thesis, we present a statistical language model for resolving speech
repairs, intonational boundaries and discourse markers. Rather than finding the
best word interpretation for an acoustic signal, we redefine the speech
recognition problem to so that it also identifies the POS tags, discourse
markers, speech repairs and intonational phrase endings (a major cue in
determining utterance units). Adding these extra elements to the speech
recognition problem actually allows it to better predict the words involved,
since we are able to make use of the predictions of boundary tones, discourse
markers and speech repairs to better account for what word will occur next.
Furthermore, we can take advantage of acoustic information, such as silence
information, which tends to co-occur with speech repairs and intonational
phrase endings, that current language models can only regard as noise in the
acoustic signal. The output of this language model is a much fuller account of
the speaker's turn, with part-of-speech assigned to each word, intonation
phrase endings and discourse markers identified, and speech repairs detected
and corrected. In fact, the identification of the intonational phrase endings,
discourse markers, and resolution of the speech repairs allows the speech
recognizer to model the speaker's utterances, rather than simply the words
involved, and thus it can return a more meaningful analysis of the speaker's
turn for later processing.

investigate the interaction of massless Dirac fields with those fields. As a
result, we find an interesting fact that the left-handed massless Dirac fields
behave in the different manner from the right-handed ones. This can be
explained as to be caused by the direct interaction of Dirac fields with the
``Yang-Mills'' field. Accordingly, the phenomenon can not happen in the

lepton-number-violating sneutrino mass, \tilde{\nu}\tilde{\nu}, splits the tau
sneutrino into two mass eigenstates: \tilde{\nu} \rightarrow \tilde{\nu}_\pm.
The absence of a Z \tilde{\nu}_- \tilde{\nu}_- coupling implies that the
lighter mass eignestate, \tilde{\nu}_-, does not annihilate via the s-channel
Z-exchange to a low cosmological abundance, and furthermore, halo sneutrinos do
not scatter excessively in Ge detectors. For the majority of the relevant
parameter space, the event rate in Ge detectors is \geq 10^{-2} events/kg/day.
The lepton number violation required for sneutrino CDM implies that the tau
neutrino mass is m_{\nu_\tau} \gtrsim 5 MeV, large enough to be excluded by B
factory experiments. Events of the form l^+ l^- \not E or jj \not E , with low
m_{ll} or m_{jj}, may be observed at LEP2. A seesaw mechanism is investigated
as the origin for the lepton number violation, and several other cosmological
and particle physics consequences of sneutrino CDM are discussed.

Following a brief survey of the requirements for quantum computational
hardware, an overview of the ion trap quantum computation project at Los Alamos
is presented. The physical limitations to quantum computation with trapped ions
are analyzed and an assessment of the computational potential of the technology
is made.

particles proposed by Hardy et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 79 (1997) 2755) works only
for nonmaximally entangled states and goes through for 50% of pairs at the
most. A similar ladder proof for two spin-1 particles in a maximally entangled
state is presented. In its simplest form, the proof goes through for 17% of
pairs. An extended version works for 100% of pairs. The proof can be extended
to any maximally entangled state of two spin-s particles (with s equal or
greater than 1).

torus with a Liouville metric on it, and describe the set of quadratically
integrable geodesic flows on the Klein bottle.
