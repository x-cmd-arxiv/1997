the strong-field regime. If the spin frequency of the neutron star can also be
determined, the frequency of the QPO would fix the mass of the neutron star for
each assumed equation of state. Here we describe how bounds on the stellar mass

N-body+fluid numerical simulations. We specifically target issues related with
effects of unresolved lumpinesses of the gas. We show that the degree of

of the process of global star formation. One of the problems of numerical
simulations is related with the uncertainties of approximation of the
supernovae (SN) feedback. It is often assumed that the feedback is mainly due
to momentum transferred by SN in to the ISM. We argue that this may not be
true. We present a realistic example of gas actively forming stars with short
cooling time for which the SF feedback is important, but the kinetic energy of
the gas motion due to SN is negligibly small as compared with the thermal

of the high-T$_c$ layered cuprates that involved blocking of the
single-particle tunneling between the weakly coupled planes by strong
intra-planar electron-electron scattering. This gave a C-axis resistivity that
tracks the ab-plane T-linear resistivity, as observed in the high-temperature
limit. In this work this mechanism is examined further for its implication for
the ground-state energy and superconductivity of the layered cuprates. It is
now argued that, unlike the single-particle tunneling, the tunneling of a
boson-like pair between the planes prepared in the BCS-type coherent trial
state remains unblocked inasmuch as the latter is by construction an eigenstate
of the pair annihilation operator. The resulting pair-delocalization along the
C-axis offers energetically a comparative advantage to the paired-up trial
state, and, thus stabilizes superconductivity. In this scheme the strongly
correlated nature of the layered system enters only through the blocking
effect, namely that a given electron is effectively repeatedly monitored
(intra-planarly scattered) by the other electrons acting as an environment, on
a time-scale shorter than the inter-planar tunneling time. Possible
relationship to other inter-layer pairing mechanisms proposed by several
workers in the field is also briefly discussed.

massless neutrinos give rise to a very large self-energy in a dense,
finite-ranged, weakly-charged medium. Such an effect, if real, would
destabilize a neutron star. To address this issue we have studied the related
problem of a massless neutrino field in the presence of an external, static
electroweak potential of finite range. To be precise, we have computed to one
loop the exact vacuum energy for the case of a spherical square well potential
of depth alpha and radius R. For small wells, the vacuum energy is reliably
determined by a perturbative expansion in the external potential. For large
wells, however, the perturbative expansion breaks down. A manifestation of this
breakdown is that the vacuum carries a non-zero neutrino charge. The energy and
neutrino charge of the ground state are, to a good approximation for large
wells, those of a neutrino condensate with chemical potential mu=alpha. Our
results demonstrate explicitly that long-range forces due to the exchange of
massless neutrinos do not threaten the stability of neutron stars.

insight into the QCD pomeron, suggesting a single gluon inner structure rather
than that of a perturbative two-gluon bound state. This paper derives a
high-energy, transverse momentum cut-off, confining solution of QCD. The
pomeron, in first approximation, is a single reggeized gluon plus a ``wee
parton'' component that compensates for the color and particle properties of
the gluon. This solution corresponds to a supercritical phase of Reggeon Field
Theory.
  Beginning with the multi-regge behavior of massive quark and gluon
amplitudes, reggeon unitarity is used to derive a reggeon diagram description
of a wide class of multi-regge amplitudes, including those describing the
formation and scattering of bound-state Regge poles. When quark and gluon
masses are taken to zero, a logarithmic divergence is produced by helicity-flip
reggeon interactions containing the infra-red quark triangle anomaly. With the
gauge symmetry partially broken, this divergence selects the bound states and
amplitudes of a confining theory. Both the pomeron and hadrons have an
anomalous color parity wee-parton component. For the pomeron the wee parton
component determines that it carries negative color charge parity and that the
leading singularity is an isolated Regge pole.

conditions, and leads us to propose a new (and non-minimal) family of
reflection factors to describe the one relevant boundary perturbation in the

must be revised in certain regimes, and we find the necessary modifications by
analytic continuation. We also propose new equations to describe excited
states, and check all equations against boundary truncated conformal space
data. Access to the finite-size spectrum enables us to observe boundary flows
when the bulk remains massless, and the formation of boundary bound states when
the bulk is massive.

long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average
probability of error per gate is less than a certain critical value, the
