($S=1/2,1,3/2,2,5/2$) are studied numerically with the quantum Monte Carlo
method. Effective spin $S$ chains are realized by ferromagnetically coupling
$n=2S$ antiferromagnetic spin chains with $S=1/2$. The temperature dependence
of the uniform susceptibility, the staggered susceptibility, and the static
structure factor peak intensity are computed down to very low temperatures,
$T/J \approx 0.01$. The correlation length at each temperature is deduced from
numerical measurements of the instantaneous spin-spin correlation function. At
high temperatures, very good agreement with exact results for the classical
spin chain is obtained independent of the value of $S$. For $S$=2 chains which
have a gap $\Delta$, the correlation length and the uniform susceptibility in
the temperature range $\Delta < T < J$ are well predicted by a semi-classical
theory due to Damle and Sachdev.

commutant of the algebra of K-invariants. It is completely controlled by the
image of m and a certain subquotient W_M of the Weyl group of K. The group W_M
is also a reflection group and forms a symplectic analogue of the little Weyl
group of a symmetric space. The proof rests ultimately on techniques from
algebraic geometry. In fact, a major part of the paper is of independent
