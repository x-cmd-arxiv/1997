functions are calculated using dimensional regularization and the minimal
subtraction (MS) scheme. It is shown that for $N\ge 2$ the model does possess a
stable fixed point in three dimensional space of coupling constants, in
accordance with predictions made earlier on the base of the lower-order
approximations. Numerical estimate for critical (marginal) value of the order
parameter dimensionality $N_c$ is given using Pad\'e-Borel summation of the

two-fold degeneracy of the eigenvalue exponents in the one-loop approximation
for the unique stable fixed point leads to the substantial decrease of the
accuracy expected within three loops and may cause powers of $\sqrt{\epsilon}$
to appear in the expansions. The critical exponents $\gamma$ and $\eta$ are
calculated for all fixed points up to $\epsilon^3$ and $\epsilon^4$,

conformal mapping. For the unique stable fixed point the magnetic
susceptibility exponent $\gamma$ for N=2 is found to differ in third order in

wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the
problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this
conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic
approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically
improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These
approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently
proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding.
Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that
bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with
limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search
appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding

  It is shown that the single crystals are sensitive to the initial circular

waves (an eigenfunctions of the problem) are elliptically polarized. The speeds
of absorption and motion of both the normal waves are different and as a result
the process of gamma-quanta propagation depend on the initial polarization

microscopy (TEM) arises because an ability to image sub-0.2 nm fringes is a
necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for imaging individual atoms. In
scanned tip microscopy, as in TEM, empirical data on instrument response should
precede assertions about point resolution. In the ``slow scan limit'',
time-domain noise and geometry effects decouple, and tip shape can take on the
role of a 2-dimensional impulse response function. We indicate here that
nuclear track pits can be used to quantitatively measure tip geometry with
nanometer-scale resolution in three dimensions, that stationary tip images
provide a robust measure of time-domain instabilities, and that when these data
are taken before and after imaging an unknown, images with instrument response
quantitatively constrained by experiment are possible. Specimen-induced tip
effects also become measurable in situ.
