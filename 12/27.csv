emission from the Galactic plane using the Balloon-borne Infrared Carbon
Explorer (BICE). Our survey covers a wide area (350 deg < l < 25 deg, |b| < 3
deg) with a spatial resolution of 15'. We employed a new observing method
called the ``fast spectral scanning'' to make large-scale observations
efficiently.
  Strong [C II] line emission was detected from almost all areas we observed.
In the general Galactic plane, the spatial distribution of the [C II] line
emission correlates very well with that of far-infrared continuum emission, but
diffuse components are more prominent in the [C II] line emission; the
I_[CII]/I_FIR ratio is ~0.6 % for diffuse components but is ~0.2 % for compact
sources such as active star-forming regions. In the Galactic center region, on
the other hand, the distribution of the [C II] line emission is quite different
from that of the far-infrared continuum emission, and the I_[CII]/I_FIR ratio
is systematically lower there.
  The FWHM velocity resolution of our instrument is 175 km/s, but we determined
the central velocity of the line at each observed point very precisely with
statistical errors as small as +- 6 km/s. The longitudinal distribution of the
central velocity clearly shows the differential rotation pattern of the
Galactic disk and also violent velocity fields around the Galactic center.

large Hall bars made of high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Thermally
activated conductivities and hopping transport were investigated in the integer
quantum Hall regime. The predominant transport processes in two dimensions are
discussed. The implications of transport regime on prefactor universality and
on the relation between $\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{xy}$ are studied. Particularly
in the Landau level tails, strictly linear dependence
$\delta\rho_{xy}(\rho_{xx})$ was found, with pronounced asymmetries with
respect to the plateau centre. At low temperatures, Ohmic (temperature
dependent) as well as non-Ohmic (current dependent) transport were investigated
and analysed on the basis of variable-range hopping theory. The non-Ohmic
regime could successfully be described by an effective electron temperature
model. The results from either the Ohmic transport or from a comparison of
Ohmic and non-Ohmic data allowed to determine the localization length $\xi$ in
two different ways. The observed divergence of $\xi(\nu)$ with the filling
factor $\nu$ approaching a Landau level centre, is in qualitative agreement
with scaling theories of electron localization. The absolute values of $\xi$
far from the $\rho_{xx}$ peaks are compared with theoretical predictions. On
one hand, discrepancies between the $\xi$ results obtained from the two
experimental methods are attributed to an inhomogeneous electric field
distribution. Extrapolation yields an effective width of dominant potential
drop of about $100 mu$m. On the other hand, our analysis suggests a divergence
of the dielectric function $\epsilon_{r} \propto \xi^{\beta}$ with $\beta
\simeq 1$.

detector is rotating, though the detector in linear uniform motion never
respond in the vacuum as expected from Poincare invariance.

The latter are in a canonical correspondence with a set of traces on Okada

formula for Jack symmetric polynomials $P_\mu(x;a)$ with a parameter $a$.
Starting with the empty diagram, we define recurrently the `dimensions'
$\dim_a$ in the same way as for the Young lattice or Pascal triangle.
  New proofs are given for two known results. The first is the $a$-hook formula
for $\dim_a$, first found by R.Stanley. Secondly, we prove (for all complex $u$
and $v$) a generalization of the identity
$\sum\nu(c(b)+u)(c(b)+v)\dim\nu/\dim\mu=(n+1)(n+uv)$, where $\nu$ runs over
immediate successors of a Young diagram $\mu$ with $n$ boxes. Here $c(b)$ is
the content of a new box $b$. The identity is known to imply the existence of
an interesting family of positive definite central functions on the infinite
symmetric group.
  The approach is based on the interpretation of a Young diagram as a pair of
interlacing sequences, so that analytic techniques may be used to solve
combinatorial problems. We show that when dealing with Jack polynomials
$P_\mu(x;a)$, it makes sense to consider `anisotropic' Young diagrams made of
rectangular boxes of size $1\times a$.
