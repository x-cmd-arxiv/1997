object is ~60 h^-2 M_sun/yr (q_0=0.5). Furthermore, these objects are dominated
by very young (<~0.2 Gyr, and a median of ~25 Myr) stellar populations,

lose their identity. Penetrating encounters between satellites are frequent and
may lead to significant mass loss and disruption. Only a minor fraction of
cluster mass (10 per cent on average) is bound to substructure at most
redshifts of interest. We discuss the application of these results to the
survival and extent of dark matter haloes associated with cluster galaxies, and
to interactions between galaxies in clusters. We find that 35-40 per cent of

understanding of what components of galaxies and their surroundings are
contributing to the absorption in various transitions. This paper considers the
kinematic composition of the class of 0.4 < z < 1.0 MgII absorbers,
particularly addressing the question of what fraction of this absorption is
produced in halos and what fraction arises from galaxy disks. We design models
with various fractional contributions from radial infall of halo material and
from a rotating thick disk component. We generate synthetic spectra from lines
of sight through model galaxies and compare the resulting ensembles of MgII
profiles with the 0.4 < z < 1.0 sample observed with HIRES/Keck. We apply a
battery of statistical tests and find that pure disk and pure halo models can
be ruled out, but that various models with rotating disk and infall/halo
contributions can produce an ensemble that is nearly consistent with the data.
A discrepancy in all models that we considered requires the existence of a
kinematic component intermediate between halo and thick disk. The variety of
MgII profiles can be explained by the gas in disks and halos of galaxies not
very much different than galaxies in the local Universe.
  In any one case there is considerable ambiguity in diagnosing the kinematic
composition of an absorber from the low ionization high resolution spectra
alone. Future data will allow galaxy morphologies, impact parameters, and
orientations, FeII/MgII of clouds, and the distribution of high ionization gas
to be incorporated into the kinematic analysis. Combining all these data will
permit a more accurate diagnosis of the physical conditions along the line of
sight through the absorbing galaxy.

this new type of analysis (Pixel Method) to the LMC Bar. We describe the
complete procedure applied to the EROS 91-92 data (one tenth of the existing
CCD data set) in order to monitor pixel fluxes. First, geometric and
photometric alignments are applied to each images. Averaging the images of each
night reduces significantly the noise level. Second, one light curve for each
of the 2.1 10^6 pixels is built and pixels are lumped into 3.6""x3.6""
super-pixels, one for each elementary pixel. An empirical correction is then
applied to account for seeing variations. We find that the final super-pixel
light curves fluctuate at a level of 1.8% of the flux in blue and 1.3% in red.
We show that this noise level corresponds to about twice the expected photon
noise and confirms previous assumptions used for the estimation of the
contribution of unresolved stars. We also demonstrate our ability to correct
very efficiently for seeing variations affecting each pixel flux. The technical
results emphasised here show the efficacy of the Pixel Method and allow us to
study luminosity variations due to possible microlensing events and variable

electron temperature, can significantly affect the Comptonization energy
spectrum from it. This means, by fitting the energy spectrum alone, it is not
possible to uniquely determine the optical depth and temperature of the
Comptonization cloud if its density profile is unknown. The hard X-ray time lag
is sensitive to the density distribution of the scattering corona. Thus
simultaneous analysis of the spectral and temporal X-ray data will allow us to
probe the density structure of the Comptonizing corona and thereby the dynamics
of mass accretion onto the compact object.

hard X-ray spectrum varies when the properties of either the soft photon source

resulting spectral modulations can determine whether the variability is due to
(i) oscillations in the injection of seed photons, (ii) oscillations in the
coronal electron density, or (iii) oscillations in the coronal energy
dissipation rate. Identifying the origin of spectral variability should help
clarify how the corona operates and its relation to the accretion disk. It will
also help in finding the mechanisms underlying the various quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPO) observed in the X-ray outputs of many accreting neutron star
and black hole systems. As a sample application of our model, we analyze a
kilohertz QPO observed in the atoll source 4U~1608-52. We find that the QPO is

ionization models to characterize the ejecta and the blast-shocked interstellar
medium. Based on the Fe K emission at 6.5 keV, previous spectral studies have
suggested that the Fe ejecta in this Type Ia remnant are stratified interior to
the other ejecta. The ASCA data provide important constraints from the Fe L
emission near 1 keV as well as the Fe K emission. We find that the simplest
models, with emission from the ejecta and blast wave each at a single
temperature and ionization age, severely underestimate the Fe K flux. We show
that there is little Fe emission associated with the Si and S ejecta shell. The
blast-shocked interstellar medium has abundances roughly 0.3 times the solar
value, while the ejecta, with the exception of Fe, have relative abundances
that are typical of Type Ia supernovae. The addition of another component of Fe
emission, which we associate with ejecta, at a temperature at least two times
higher and an ionization age $\sim$ 100 times lower than the Si ejecta, does
provide a good fit to the spectrum. This model is consistent with X-ray imaging
results. Although fluorescent emission from dust in the remnant may contribute
to the Fe K flux, we conclude that it is unlikely to dominate.

concluded a search begin in 1973. The problem of explaining the mechanisms of
GRB and their persistent counterparts remains. There are two classes of models:
1) GRB continue weakly for days at all frequencies; 2) GRB emission shifts to
lower frequencies as relativistic debris sweeps up surrounding gas (in an
``external shock'') and slows. In 1) the visible afterglow is accompanied by
continuing gamma-ray emission, as hinted by the high energy emission of
GRB940217 and the ``Gang of Four'' bursts of October 27--29, 1996; the
persistent emission may fluctuate. Behavior of this sort may be found in
``internal shock'' models. Models of class 2) have been the subject of several
theoretical studies which disagree in assumptions and details but which predict
that at each frequency the flux should rise and then decline, with the maximum
coming later at lower frequencies. Some of this behavior has been observed, but
data from GRB970508 show that its afterglow cannot be simply extrapolated from
its gamma-ray emission. It is likely that both classes of processes occur in
most GRB. Comparisons between GRB show that they are not all scaled versions of
the same event. These results suggest that most gamma-ray emission is the
result of ``internal shocks'' while most afterglow is the result of ``external
shocks'', and hint at the presence of collimated outflows. Self-absorption in
the radio spectrum of GRB970508 permitted the size of the radiating surface to
be estimated, and in future GRB it may be possible to follow the expansion of
the shell in detail and to construct an energy budget.

energy of 7.13^+0.21_-0.16 keV. The spectrum is flat (Gamma = 1.5) with a
substantial absorption Nh = 10^22 cm^-2 and does not require any reflection
component. There is also evidence of a narrow Fe Kalpha emission line, whose
rest energy (E = 6.35^+0.08_ -0.03 keV) and equivalent width (EW = 130+-50 eV)
suggest that the line originates from thick and cold matter. The intensity of
the line and, in particular, the depth of the iron edge are too strong to be
explained by simple transmission through the measured absorption column
density. This strongly suggests that a model more complex than a single
absorbed power law is needed. We propose an absorption model that we call
""leaky-total absorber"" which can explain the spectrum flatness, the iron
emission line and the edge absorption feature and has also the advantage of
having a straightforward physical interpretation in the framework of Unified
models. In this model a thick absorber (Nh = 10^23 cm^-2), possibly associated
with broad line region (BLR) clouds, partially (36 %) covers the source
continuum with Gamma fixed to 1.9 as observed in Sey 1 galaxies. The escaping
radiation is then absorbed by a column density Nh = 10^22 cm^-2, which can be
attributed to the torus, seen through its rim.

the quantum-mechanical scattering matrix and its semiclassical equivalent based
on the semiclassical zeta-function of Gutzwiller and Voros. Our
quantum-mechanical calculation is well-defined at every step, as the on-shell
T-matrix and the multiscattering kernel M-1 are shown to be trace-class. The
multiscattering determinant can be organized in terms of the cumulant expansion
which is the defining prescription for the determinant over an infinite, but
trace-class matrix. The quantum cumulants are then expanded by traces which, in
turn, split into quantum itineraries or cycles. These can be organized by a
simple symbolic dynamics. The semiclassical reduction of the coherent
multiscattering part takes place on the level of the quantum cycles. We show
that the semiclassical analog of the m-th quantum cumulant is the m-th
curvature term of the semiclassical zeta function. In this way quantum
mechanics naturally imposes the curvature regularization structured by the
topological (not the geometrical) length of the pertinent periodic orbits onto
the semiclassical zeta function. However, since the cumulant limit m->infinity
and the semiclassical limit hbar->0 do not commute in general, the
semiclassical analog of the quantum multiscattering determinant is a curvature
expanded, truncated semiclassical zeta function. We relate the order of this
truncation to the topological entropy of the corresponding classical system.

scheme by applying it to several different lane changing rules, which, in spite

the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix from the data. However, if the

provide only incomplete or misleading information on the statistical properties
of the data. To handle such situations we propose neural network algorithms,
with an hybrid (supervised and unsupervised) learning scheme, which constructs
the characteristic function of the probability distribution and the transition
functions of the stochastic process. Illustrative examples are presented, which
include Cauchy and Levy-type processes

fluctuating barrier is revisited. We discuss the important distinctions between
barriers that can fluctuate among ""up"" and ""down"" configurations, and barriers
that are always ""up"" but that can fluctuate among different heights. A
resonance as a function of the barrier fluctuation rate is found in both cases,
but the nature and physical description of these resonances is quite distinct.
The nature of the resonances, the physical basis for the resonant behavior, and
the importance of boundary conditions are discussed in some detail. We obtain
analytic expressions for the escape time over the barrier that explicitly
capture the minima as a function of the barrier fluctuation rate, and show that
our analytic results are in excellent agreement with numerical results.

excellent asymptotic characteristics but it is very sensitive to the choice of
smoothness parameters. On the other hand the Bayesian approach, best
exemplified by the mixture of gaussians models, is optimal given the observed
data but it is very sensitive to the choice of prior. In 1984 the author
proposed to use the Cross-Validated gaussian kernel as the likelihood for the
smoothness scale parameter h, and obtained a closed formula for the posterior
mean of h based on Jeffreys's rule as the prior. The practical operational
characteristics of this bayes' rule for the smoothness parameter remained
unknown for all these years due to the combinatorial complexity of the formula.
It is shown in this paper that a version of the metropolis algorithm can be
used to approximate the value of h producing remarkably good completely
automatic and adaptive kernel estimators. A close study of the form of the
cross validated likelihood suggests a modification and a new approach to
Bayesian Non-parametrics in general.

occur to what would have occurred if certain quantum choices had gone
differently. All the statements in the proof have natural meanings within the

what exactly constitutes an observation (the measurement problem) and may
therefore be applied just as readily to the macroscopic world as to the

  Quantum Mechanics","28 pages; to be published in Int. J. Theor. Phys","Int.J.Theor.Phys. 38 (1999) 115-130",,,"quant-ph",,"  Intrinsic microphysical irreversibility is the time asymmetry observed in
exponentially decaying states. It is described by the semigroup generated by
the Hamiltonian $\QTR{it}{H}$ of the quantum physical system, not by the
semigroup generated by a Liouvillian $\QTR{it}{L}$ which describes the
irreversibility due to the influence of an external reservoir or measurement
apparatus. The semigroup time evolution generated by $\QTR{it}{H}$ is
impossible in the Hilbert Space (HS) theory, which allows only time symmetric
boundary conditions and an unitary group time evolution. This leads to problems
with decay probabilities in the HS theory. To overcome these and other problems
(non-existence of Dirac kets) caused by the Lebesgue integrals of the HS, one
extends the HS to a Gel'fand triplet, which contains not only Dirac kets, but
also generalized eigenvectors of the self-adjoint $\QTR{it}{H}$ with complex
eigenvalues ($E_R-i\Gamma /2$) and a Breit-Wigner energy distribution. These
Gamow states $\psi ^G$ have a time asymmetric exponential evolution. One can
derive the decay probability of the Gamow state into the decay products
described by $\Lambda $ from the basic formula of quantum mechanics
$\QTR{cal}{P}(t)=Tr(|\psi ^G> < \psi ^G|\Lambda)$, which in HS quantum
mechanics is identically zero. From this result one derives the decay rate
$\QTR{group}{\dot c}(t)$ and all the standard relations between
$\QTR{group}{\dot c}(0)$, $\Gamma $ and the lifetime $\tau_R$ used in the
phenomenology of resonance scattering and decay. In the Born approximation one
obtains Dirac's Golden Rule.
