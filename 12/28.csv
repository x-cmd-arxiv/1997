  fourth degree in momenta","17 pages, AMS-LaTeX",,,,"dg-ga math.DG",,"  There is a well-known example of integrable conservative system on $S^2$, the
case of Kovalevskaya in the dynamics of a rigid body, possessing an integral of
fourth degree in momenta. Goryachev proposed a one-parameter family of examples
of conservative systems on $S^2$ possessing an integral of fourth degree in
momenta which includes the case of Kovalevskaya. In this paper we proposed new
examples of conservative systems on $S^2$ possessing an integral of fourth
degree in momenta.

of holomorphy in a complex G-manifold. If there is a G_R-invariant strictly
plurisubharmonic function on X which has certain exhaustion properties, then we
show that the extended domain G.X is also a domain of holomorphy. As an
application we give a proof of the extended future tube conjecture. This is the
assertion that G.X is a domain of holomorphy in the case where X is the N-fold
product of the tube domain in C^4 over the positive light cone in R^4 and G is
the connected complex Lorentz group acting diagonally.

supersymmetric theories with 4 and 8 supercharges. In particular, we define a
regularized volume for hyperkahler quotients. We evaluate this volume for
certain ALE and ALF spaces in terms of the hyperkahler periods. We also reduce
these volumes for a large class of hyperkahler quotients to simpler integrals.
These quotients include complex coadjoint orbits, instanton moduli spaces on
R^4 and ALE manifolds, Hitchin spaces, and moduli spaces of parabolic Higgs
bundles on Riemann surfaces. In the case of Hitchin spaces the evaluation of
the volume reduces to a summation over solutions of Bethe Ansatz equations for
the non-linear Schroedinger system. We discuss some applications of our
results.

odd part. In two dimensions, and only then, such odd viscosity is compatible
with isotropy. Elementary and basic features of odd viscosity are examined by
considering solutions of the wave and Navier-Stokes equations for hypothetical
fluids where the stress is dominated by odd viscosity.
