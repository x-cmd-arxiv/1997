resembles experimental results for manganites occurs for $J'$ smaller than 0.11
in units of the $e_g$ hopping amplitude. In particular a coexistence of
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic excitations is observed at low-hole density
in agreement with neutron scattering experiments on
$\rm{La_{2-2x}Sr_{1+2x}Mn_2O_7}$ with$x=0.4$. This effect is caused by the
recently reported tendency to phase separation between hole-rich ferromagnetic
and hole-undoped antiferromagnetic domains in electronic models for manganites.
As $J'$ increases metal-insulator transitions are detected by monitoring the
optical conductivity and the density of states. The magnetic correlations
reveal the existence of spiral phases without long-range order but with fairly
large correlation lengths. Indications of charge ordering effects appear in the

rate curve (FRC), based on an data in the period 1990-1996. We find that the
average FRC (measured from the spot rate) grows as the square-root of the
maturity, with a prefactor which is comparable to the spot rate volatility.
This suggests that forward rate market prices include a risk premium,
comparable to the probable changes of the spot rate between now and maturity,
which can be understood as a `Value-at-Risk' type of pricing. The instantaneous
FRC however departs form a simple square-root law. The distortion is maximum
around one year, and reflects the market anticipation of a local trend on the
spot rate. This anticipated trend is shown to be calibrated on the past
behaviour of the spot itself. We show that this is consistent with the
volatility `hump' around one year found by several authors (and which we
confirm). Finally, the number of independent components needed to interpret
most of the FRC fluctuations is found to be small. We rationalize this by
showing that the dynamical evolution of the FRC contains a stabilizing second
derivative (line tension) term, which tends to suppress short scale distortions
of the FRC. This shape dependent term could lead, in principle, to arbitrage.
However, this arbitrage cannot be implemented in practice because of
transaction costs. We suggest that the presence of transaction costs (or other
market `imperfections') is crucial for model building, for a much wider class
of models becomes eligible to represent reality.

distribution is an equilibrium, Gibbsian one. However, due to the presence of
hierarchical constraints in the dynamics the system is found to relax to its
equilibrium distribution in an extremely slow fashion when suddenly cooled from
an initial temperature, $T_0$, to a final one $T_f$. The relaxation curve in
that case can be fit by an stretched exponential curve. On the other hand the
relaxation function is found to be exponential when $T_f >T_0$, with
characteristic times depending on both $T_f$ and $T_0$, with characteristic
times obeying an Arrhenius law.

the precision for measuring d_n implies a lower bound of 10^5 TeV on the scale

functioning. We propose specific experiments in order to test our predictions.
