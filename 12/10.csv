results suggest that the nature of update is a relevant parameter for dynamic
universality classes of extended dynamical systems, generalizing results
obtained previously for the static properties. They also indicate that the

the redshift distribution within a suite of models for the evolution of
structure in the Universe, including models with Omega=1 (SCDM and CHDM) and
with Omega=0.4-0.5 (LCDM and OCDM). Using high-resolution dissipationless
N-body simulations, we analyze deep pencil-beam surveys from these models in
the same way that they are actually observed, identifying LBOs with the most
massive dark matter halos. We find that all the models (with SCDM as a marginal
exception) have a substantial probability of producing spikes similar to those
observed, because the massive halos are much more clumped than the underlying
matter -- i.e., they are biased. Therefore, the likelihood of such a spike is
not a good discriminator among these models. We find in these models that the
mean biasing parameter b of LBOs with respect to dark matter varies within a
range b ~2-5 on a scale of ~10Mpc/h. We also compute the two-body correlation
functions of LBOs predicted in these models. The LBO correlation functions are
less steep than galaxies today (gamma ~1.4), but show similar or slightly
longer correlation lengths.

scattering is caused by rough side boundaries, have been studied. The
conductance of such strips is highly sensitive to the intercorrelation
properties of inhomogeneities of the opposite edges. The case with completely
correlated statistically identical boundaries (CCB) is a peculiar one. Herein
the electron scattering is uniquely due to fluctuations of the asperity slope
and is not related to the strip width fluctuations. Owing to this, the electron
relaxation lengths, specifically the localization length, depend quite
differently on the asperity parameters as compared to the conductors with
arbitrarily intercorrelated edges. The method for calculating the dynamical
characteristics of the CCB electron waveguides is proposed clear of the
restrictions on the asperity height.

implementing the local gauge symmetry. In this way the so called fine-tuning

iterative solution of the RG equation; we perform one loop calculations in
order to determine how much the fermionic matter modifies the asymptotic form
of the couplings. Then we compute the beta-function and we check gluon
transversality. Finally, a proof of perturbative renormalizability is shown.

description of ground-state properties of Ni and Sn isotopes. The NL3 parameter
set is used for the effective mean-field Lagrangian, and pairing correlations
are described by the pairing part of the finite range Gogny interaction D1S.
Fully self-consistent RHB solutions are calculated for the Ni ($28\leq N\leq
50$) and Sn ($50\leq N\leq 82$) isotopes. Binding energies, neutron separation
energies, and proton and neutron $rms$ radii are compared with experimental
data. The model predicts a reduction of the spin-orbit potential with the
increase of the number of neutrons. The resulting energy splittings between
spin-orbit partners are discussed, as well as pairing properties calculated
with the finite range effective interaction in the $pp$ channel.

state dependent correlations having spin, isospin and tensor components. Fermi
hypernetted chain integral equations and single operator chain approximation
are used to evaluate one- and two-body densities and ground state energy. The
results are in good agreement with the available variational MonteCarlo data,
providing a first substantial check for the accuracy of the cluster expansion
method with state dependent correlations. The finite nuclei treatment of non
central interactions and correlations has, at least, the same level of accuracy
as in infinite nuclear matter. The binding energy for the full U14+TNI
interaction is computed, addressing its small momentum dependent contributions
in local density approximation. The nuclei are underbound by about 1 MeV per
nucleon. Further energy lowering might be achieved by a more accurate
variational minimization.

the total photon absorption cross sections $\sigma_{1/2}$ and $\sigma_{3/2}$ on
the nucleon via photon excitation of baryon resonances in the constituent quark
model. A total of seventeen, low-lying, non-strange baryon resonances are
included in this calculation. The transverse and longitudinal interference
cross section, $\sigma_{1/2}^{TL}$, is found to play an important role in the
study of the $Q^2$ variation of the sum rule. The results show that the GDH sum
rule is saturated by these resonances at a confidence level of 94%. In
particular, the $P_{33}(1232)$ excitation largely saturates the sum rule at
$Q^2 = 0$, and dominates at small $Q^2$. The GDH integral has a strong
$Q^2$-dependence below $Q^2= 1.0 {GeV}^2$ and changes its sign around $Q^2= 0.3
{GeV}^2$. It becomes weakly $Q^2$-dependent for $Q^2 > 1.0 {GeV}^2$ because of
the quick decline of the resonance contributions. We point out that the $Q^2$
variation of the GDH sum rule is very important for understanding the nucleon
spin structure in the non-perturbative QCD region.

spectrum is expected to be a smooth function of spin. Thus, fitting the
rotational spectrum in terms of a low order polynomial in spin seems to be
justified. However, this is not what we found in the present work. We show that
the measured spectrum is not necessarily a smooth function of the spin, which
is quite surprising. Whether or not it indicates the presence of some hidden
physics is an open question.

  revised version",,,,"q-alg hep-th math.QA",,"  Coherence phenomena appear in two different situations. In the context of
category theory the term `coherence constraints' refers to a set of diagrams
whose commutativity implies the commutativity of a larger class of diagrams. In
the context of algebra coherence constrains are a minimal set of generators for
the second syzygy, that is, a set of equations which generate the full set of
identities among the defining relations of an algebraic theory.
  A typical example of the first type is Mac Lane's coherence theorem for
monoidal categories, an example of the second type is the result of Drinfel'd
saying that the pentagon identity for the `associator' of a quasi-Hopf algebra
implies the validity of a set of identities with higher instances of this
associator.
  We show that both types of coherence are governed by a homological invariant
of the operad for the underlying algebraic structure. We call this invariant
the (space of) coherence constraints. In many cases these constraints can be
explicitly described, thus giving rise to various coherence results, both
classical and new.
