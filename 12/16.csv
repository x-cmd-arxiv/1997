tunable degree of neutrality. The model allows us to study the general
properties of molecular species undergoing neutral evolution. We find that a
number of phenomena seen in RNA sequence-structure maps are present also in our
general model. Examples are the occurrence of ""common"" structures which occupy
a fraction of the genotype space which tends to unity as the length of the
genotype increases, and the formation of percolating neutral networks which
cover the genotype space in such a way that a member of such a network can be
found within a small radius of any point in the space. We also describe a
number of new phenomena which appear to be general properties of neutrally
evolving systems. In particular, we show that the maximum fitness attained
during the adaptive walk of a population evolving on such a fitness landscape
increases with increasing degree of neutrality, and is directly related to the
fitness of the most fit percolating network.

convert the entire neutron matter into radiation. This process would release
~10^{54} ergs in electromagnetic radiation over ~10^{-4} sec, with negligible
baryonic contamination. The resulting fireball would have all the properties
necessary to produce a gamma-ray burst as a result of its interaction with
ambient interstellar gas. The subsequent Higgs decay would produce a
millisecond burst of ~10^{52} ergs in ~100 GeV neutrinos which might be

of correlation functions with redshift against current observational data to
constrain available models of structure formation. Theories that fit the

observed redshift evolution of galaxy clustering if galaxies are no more than
slightly biased at $z\sim 1$. We also discuss the interpretation of a

homogeneous media. For realistic galactic disks we show that the formation of
fragments is influenced by the amount of energy supply from the final number of
young stars in an OB association, the value of the sound speed, the
stratification and density of the ambient medium, the galactic differential
rotation and the gravitational force perpendicular to the galactic plane. The
typical size of gravitationally unstable shells is 1 kpc for an ambient gas
density n=1 cm^-3. In thick disk galaxies the fragmentation occurs in nearly
the whole shell while in thin disks it is restricted to the galactic equator.
Unstable fragments may become molecular and trigger the formation of molecular
clouds, and finally new star formation. We conclude that in dwarf galaxies the
star formation may propagate in all directions turning the system into a star-
burst. Contrary to that, the star formation in spiral galaxies propagates only
in some directions in a thin strip near the symmetry plane, basically at the
tips of the expanding shell.

strength of galaxy clustering, it is less clear whether straightforward biasing
schemes can change the shape of the galaxy correlation function on large
scales. Here we consider ""local"" biasing models, in which the galaxy density
field $\delta_g$ at a point is a function of the matter density field $\delta$
at that point: $\delta_g = f(\delta)$. We consider both deterministic biasing,
where $f$ is simply a function, and stochastic biasing, in which the galaxy
density is a random variable whose distribution depends on the matter density:
$\delta_g=X(\delta)$. We show that even when this mapping is performed on a
highly nonlinear density field with a hierarchical correlation structure, the
correlation function $\xi$ is simply scaled up by a constant, as long as $\xi
<< 1$. In stochastic biasing models, the galaxy autocorrelation function
behaves exactly as in deterministic models, with the mean value of $X$ for a
given value of $\delta$ taking the role of the deterministic bias function. We
extend our results to the power spectrum P(k), showing that for sufficiently
small k, the effect of local biasing is equivalent to the multiplication of
P(k) by a constant, with the addition of a constant term. If a cosmological
model predicts a large-scale mass correlation function in conflict with the
shape of the observed galaxy correlation function, then the model cannot be
rescued by appealing to a complicated but local relation between galaxies and
mass.

density, we associate each particle with the densest of the N_hop particles
nearest to it. Repeating this process allows us to trace a path, within the
particle set itself, from each particle in the direction of increasing density.
The path ends when it reaches a particle that is its own densest neighbor; all
particles reaching the same such particle are identified as a group. Combined
with an adaptive smoothing kernel for finding the densities, this method is
spatially adaptive, coordinate-free, and numerically straight-forward. One can
proceed to process the output by truncating groups at a particular density
contour and combining groups that share a (possibly different) density contour.
While the resulting algorithm has several user-chosen parameters, we show that
the results are insensitive to most of these, the exception being the outer
density cutoff of the groups.

existence of an extra-mixing process that becomes efficient on the red giant
branch only when the low-mass stars reach the so-called luminosity function
bump. We use the values of the carbon isotopic ratio observed in our sample to
get constraints on the mu-barriers that may shield the central regions of a
star from extra-mixing. We show that the same value of the critical gradient of

This ``observational critical mu-gradient'' is in very good agreement with the

strong clues on the nature of the extra-mixing which occurs on the RGB, and

this stellar component is removed, the gaseous emission is related to the
optical luminosity by Lx proportional to L_B^m, where m = 3.0-3.5,

a model whereby environment influences the X-ray behavior of these galaxies:
early-type galaxies attempt to drive partial or total galactic winds, which can
be stifled by the pressure of their environment. Stifled winds should lead to
hotter and higher luminosity systems, which would occur most commonly in the

is shown using a nonperturbative approach that quasi-localized states in weakly
disordered systems can cause the curvature distribution to be nonanalytic. In
$2d$ systems the distribution function $P(K)$ has a branching point at K=0 that
is related to the multifractality of the wave functions and thus should be a
generic feature of all critical eigenstates. A relationship between the
branching power and the multifractality exponent $d_{2}$ is suggested. Evidence
of the branch-cut singularity is found in numerical simulations in $2d$ systems

impurity-assisted, surface state assisted, and inelastic contributions to a
tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). Theoretically calculated direct tunneling in
iron group systems leads to about a 30% change in resistance, which is close to
experimentally observed values. It is shown that the larger observed values of
the TMR might be a result of tunneling involving surface polarized states. We
find that tunneling via resonant defect states in the barrier radically
decreases the TMR (down to 4% with Fe-based electrodes), and a resonant tunnel
diode structure would give a TMR of about 8%. With regards to inelastic
tunneling, magnons and phonons exhibit opposite effects: one-magnon emission
generally results in spin mixing and, consequently, reduces the TMR, whereas
phonons are shown to enhance the TMR. The inclusion of both magnons and phonons
reasonably explains an unusual bias dependence of the TMR.
  The model presented here is applied qualitatively to half-metallics with 100%
spin polarization, where one-magnon processes are suppressed and the change in
resistance in the absence of spin-mixing on impurities may be arbitrarily
large. Even in the case of imperfect magnetic configurations, the resistance
change can be a few 1000 percent. Examples of half-metallic systems are

quite naturally related to the electron localization function (ELF), which
provides a very informative analysis of the electron distribution. Studies of
ELF, as obtained from accurate Kohn-Sham orbitals in real materials, allow an

load for onset of crack motion are investigated both analytically and by
numerical simulations. Elasticity of the solid leads to long range stress
transfer along the crack front which is non-monotonic in time due to the
elastic waves in the medium. In the quasistatic limit with instantaneous stress
transfer, the crack front exhibits dynamic critical phenomenon, with a second
order like transition from a pinned to a moving phase as the applied load is
increased through a critical value. At criticality, the crack-front is
self-affine, with a roughness exponent $\zeta =0.34\pm 0.02$. The dynamic
exponent $z$ is found to be equal to $ 0.74\pm 0.03$ and the correlation length
exponent $\nu =1.52\pm 0.02$. These results are in good agreement with those
obtained from an epsilon expansion. Sound-travel time delays in the stress
transfer do not change the static exponents but the dynamic exponent $z$
becomes exactly one. Real elastic waves, however, lead to overshoots in the
stresses above their eventual static value when one part of the crack front
moves forward. Simplified models of these stress overshoots are used to show
that overshoots are relevant at the depinning transition leading to a decrease
in the critical load and an apparent jump in the velocity of the crack front
directly to a non-zero value. In finite systems, the velocity also shows
hysteretic behaviour as a function of the loading. These results suggest a
first order like transition. Possible implications for real tensile cracks are
discussed.

temperature, chiral phase structure depends on the number of flavours and to a
large extent on the particular values of the fermion masses. For two massless
flavours there is a true second order transition. It has been argued that this
transition belongs to the universality class of the three-dimensional O(4) spin
model. The arguments have been questioned recently, and the transition was
claimed to be mean field behaved. In this lecture we discuss this issue at the
example of the three-dimensional, parity symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite
temperature, with a large number N of fermions. At zero temperature there is a
phase where parity is spontaneously broken. At finite temperature, this model
has a parity restoring second order transition. It reveals considerable
similarity to the QCD chiral phase transition. There are related questions here
concerning the universality class. We solve this problem essentially by means
of the following methods: Large N expansion, dimensional reduction in the
framework of quantum field theory, and high order convergent series expansions
about disordered lattice systems.

explore certain aspects of selfdual, four dimensional gauge fields
(quasi)periodic in the Euclidean time. These fields are characterized by two
topological numbers and contain standard instantons and monopoles as different
limits. The iterations do not correspond directly to a discretized time
evolution of the gauge fields. They are implemented in an indirect fashion.
First, (t,r,\theta,\phi) being the standard coordinates, the (r,t) half plane
is mapped on the unit disc in an appropriate way. This provides an (r,t)
parametrization (Sec.1) of Z_0, the starting point of the iterations and makes
the iterates increasingly complex functions of r and t. These are then
incorporated as building blocks in the generating function of the fields
(Sec.2). We explain (starting in Sec.1 and at different stages) in what sense
and to what extent some remarkable features of our map (indicated in the title)
are thus carried over into the continuous time development of the fields.
Special features for quasiperiodicity are studied (Sec.3). Spinor solutions
(Sec.4) and propagators (Sec.5) are discussed from the point of view of the
mapping. Several possible generalizations are indicated (Sec.6). Some broader
topics are discussd in conclusion (Sec.7).
