and maps between flag manifolds. We establish a number of new identities among
these structure constants. This leads to formulas for some of these constants

partial order on the symmetric group which contains Young's lattice arises from
these investigations. We also derive formulas for certain specializations of

describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept)
and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is
the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that
precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point
out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition
containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of
choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a
formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the
feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation
formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In
addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers,
and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs
to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs
enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of
recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc.
We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the
computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a
particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.

  (SCGT 96), Nagoya, Japan",,,"BUHEP-97-7","hep-ph hep-lat",,"  The triviality of the scalar sector of the standard one-doublet Higgs model
implies that this model is only an effective low-energy theory valid below some
cut-off scale Lambda. We show that the experimental constraint on the amount of
custodial symmetry violation implies that the scale Lambda must be greater than
of order 7.5 TeV. The underlying high-energy theory must also include flavor
dynamics at a scale of order Lambda or greater in order to give rise to the
different Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to ordinary fermions. This flavor
dynamics will generically produce flavor-changing neutral currents. We show
that the experimental constraints on the neutral D-meson mass difference imply
that Lambda must be greater than of order 21 TeV. For theories defined about
the infrared-stable Gaussian fixed-point, we estimate that this lower bound on
Lambda yields an upper bound of approximately 460 GeV on the Higgs boson's
mass, independent of the regulator chosen to define the theory. We also show
that some regulator schemes, such as higher-derivative regulators, used to
define the theory about a different fixed-point are particularly dangerous
because an infinite number of custodial-isospin-violating operators become
relevant.
