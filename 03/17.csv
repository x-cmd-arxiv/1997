  of Figs. 4 & 6",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Part of the mystery around the Bulge carbon stars from Azzopardi et al.
(1991) is solved, if they are related to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The
carbon stars are in that case not metal-rich as previously thought, but they
have a metallicity comparable to the LMC, with an age between 0.1 to 1 Gyr. A
significant fraction of the carbon stars still have luminosities fainter than
the lower LMC limit of Mbol~-3.5. A similar trend is present among some of the
carbon stars found in other dwarf spheroidals, but they do not reach a limit as
faint as Mbol~-1.4 found for the SMC. At present, the TP-AGB evolution models
cannot explain the origin of carbon stars with Mbol>-3.5 through a single-star
evolution scenario, even if they form immediately after entering the TP-AGB
phase. Mass transfer through binary evolution is suggested as a possible
scenario to explain the origin of these low luminosity carbon stars.

dominated by stalled objects, while for R>R_e it is dominated by growing
objects. We also briefly investigate N(R) resulting from momentum-conserving
shell evolution. We predict a peak in N(R) corresponding to individual SNRs. To
estimate the MLF, we also examine evolutionary effects on the HII region
luminosity function (HII LF), finding that for nebular luminosity fading as a
power law in time, there is a minimum observed slope for the HII LFs.
Comparison with the largely complete HI hole catalog for the SMC shows
surprising agreement in the predicted and observed slope of N(R), suggesting
that no other fundamental process is needed to explain the size distribution of
shells in the SMC. Further comparison with largely incomplete HI data for M31,
M33, and Holmberg II is also encouraging. We present expressions for the ISM
porosity parameters, and estimate that they are substantially <1 for all of the

strongly dominated by a hot interstellar component. However, porosity results
for the Galaxy remain inconclusive.

models in which the initial and final conditions are independently specified,
and several authors have investigated experimental tests of such models.
  We point out here that GMH time-neutral models can allow superluminal
signalling, in the sense that it can be possible for observers in those
cosmologies, by detecting and exploiting regularities in the final state, to
construct devices which send and receive signals between space-like separated
points. In suitable cosmologies, any single superluminal message can be
transmitted with probability arbitrarily close to one by the use of redundant
signals. However, the outcome probabilities of quantum measurements generally
depend on precisely which past {\it and future} measurements take place. As the
transmission of any signal relies on quantum measurements, its transmission
probability is similarly context-dependent. As a result, the standard
superluminal signalling paradoxes do not apply. Despite their unusual features,
the models are internally consistent.
  These results illustrate an interesting conceptual point. The standard view
of Minkowski causality is not an absolutely indispensable part of the
mathematical formalism of relativistic quantum theory. It is contingent on the
empirical observation that naturally occurring ensembles can be naturally
pre-selected but not post-selected.

supersymmetric form in which a loop splitting and joining are represented by a
manifestly supersymmetric as well as supergauge invariant operation in
superspace. This is found to be a natural extension from the abelian case. We
solve the equation to leading order in perturbation theory or equivalently in
the linearized approximation, obtaining a desirable nontrivial answer. The
super Wilson-loop variable can be represented as the system of one-dimensional
fermion along the loop coupled minimally to the original theory. One-loop
renormalization of the one-point Wilson-loop average is explicitly carried out,
exploiting this property. The picture of string dynamics obtained is briefly
discussed.

volume enclosed by the surface. The associated variational problem yields as
solutions constant mean curvature surfaces. One may then show the equivalence
of this equation of motion to that of an SU(2) principal chiral model coupled
to gravity. It is also possible by means of the Kemmotsu representation
theorem, restricted to constant curvature surfaces, to map the solution space
of the string model into the one of the $CP^1$ nonlinear sigma model. I also
show how a description of the Gauss map of the surface in terms of SU(2)

Gross-Neveu spinorial model coupled to 2-D gravity. The standard
three-dimensional string equations can also be recovered by setting the

BPS bound states of type II superstring theories, and on the role of
supermembranes in M-theory. The first part describes classical solutions of 11d
supergravity which upon dimensional reduction and T-dualities give bound states
of NS-NS and R-R p-branes of type IIA and IIB string theories. In some cases
(e.g. (q_1,q_2) string bound states of type IIB string theory), these
non-perturbative objects admit a simple eleven-dimensional description in terms
of a fundamental 2-brane. The BPS excitations of such 2-brane are calculated
and shown to exactly match the mass spectrum for the BPS (q_1,q_2) string bound
states. Different 11d representations of the same bound state can be used to
provide inequivalent (T-dual) descriptions of the oscillating BPS states. This
permits to test T-duality beyond perturbation theory and, in certain cases, to
evade membrane instabilities by going to a stable T-dual representation. We
finally summarize the results indicating in what regions of the modular
parameter space a supermembrane description for M-theory on R^9 x T^2 seems to
be adequate.

proper-time integrals over the corresponding (complex) contours. The
vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitudes and number of created particles are
found and vacuum instability is discussed. The mean values of the current and
energy-momentum tensor are evaluated, and different approximations for them are
investigated. The back reaction of the particles created to the electromagnetic
field is estimated in different regimes. The connection between proper-time
method and effective action is outlined. The effective action in scalar QED in

strength. Possible further applications of the results are briefly mentioned.
