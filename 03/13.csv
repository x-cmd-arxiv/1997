amplitude of the fluctuation lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies,
spiral galaxies, and walls. The global rotation gives a natural explanation of
the empirical relation between the angular momentum and mass of galaxies:
$J\propto M^{5/3}$. The present angular velocity of the universe is estimated,

giant elliptical galaxies occur in an advection-dominated mode. The poor
radiative efficiency of this accretion solution accounts for the fact that
massive black holes, which are believed to reside in the centres of these
galaxies, do not have the luminosities expected if accretion from the hot
interstellar medium occurs at the Bondi rate. We discuss the
advection-dominated solution for the nucleus of M60 (NGC 4649) and show that
accretion at the Bondi rate is consistent with the core flux from radio to
X-ray. This solution allows for a black hole mass of ~ 10^9 solar masses as
required by independent arguments. The successful application of this model to
both M60, and previously to the well known nucleus of M87, suggests that
accretion of hot gas in an elliptical galaxy creates the ideal circumstances
for advection-dominated accretion flows to operate.

delayed with respect to the continuum variations by 50-110 days with the red

ratio is positively correlated with both the continuum flux and UV line
strength, a behavior different from other AGNs studied so far; (3) The blue
sides of the Ly_alpha and CIV profiles are similar to the blue side of the
Balmer lines, while the red sides are different, suggesting a different origin
for the red peak in the Balmer lines. Our results suggest: (1) The broad CIV

overall behaviour of the CIV/Ly_alpha ratio and the absence of a big blue bump,
strongly indicate the coexistence of optically thick as well as optically thin

the BLR gas is situated at 83$\pm$25 lightdays from the central source; (4)

for that concern photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy. The
evolution of the density of states as a function of concentration of charge

opening up of a gap between single polaronic and bi-polaronic states, in
analogy to the Hubbard problem for strongly correlated electron systems. The
crossover regime between adiabatic and anti-adiabatic small polarons is
triggered by two characteristic time scales: the renormalized electron hopping
rate and the renormalized vibrational frequency becoming equal. This crossover
regime is then characterized by temporarily alternating self- localization and
delocalization of the charge carriers which is accompanied by phase slips in
the charge and molecular deformation oscillations and ultimately leads to a
dephasing between these two dynamical components of the polaron problem. We
visualize these features by a study of the temporal evolution of the charge

The existence

backscattering of the field governed by the relevant wave equation. Strong
tails are characterised as those for which the purely radiative part of the

analysis of the high quality fusion data available for this system, we deduce
negative static quadrupole moments for both the first 2$^{+}$ and 3$^{-}$

computational times because the most interesting motions are very slow compared
with the fast oscillations of bond lengths and bond angles that limit the
integration time step. Simulation of dynamics in the space of internal
coordinates, that is with bond lengths, bond angles and torsions as independent
variables, gives a theoretical possibility to eliminate all uninteresting fast
degrees of freedom from the system. This paper presents a new method for
internal coordinate molecular dynamics simulations of macromolecules. Equations
of motion are derived which are applicable to branched chain molecules with any
number of internal degrees of freedom. Equations use the canonical variables
and they are much simpler than existing analogs. In the numerical tests the
internal coordinate dynamics are compared with the traditional Cartesian
coordinate molecular dynamics in simulations a 56 residue globular protein. It
is shown that the traditional and internal coordinate dynamics require the same
time step size for the same accuracy and that in the standard geometry
approximation of amino acids, that is with fixed bond lengths, bond angles and
rigid aromatic groups, the characteristic step size is 4 fsec, that is two
times higher than with fixed bond lengths only. The step size can be increased
up to 11 fsec when rotation of hydrogen atoms is suppressed.

describing a sector of matter above some critical distance scale, several
sectors of matter with different critical speeds in vacuum can coexist and an
absolute rest frame (the vacuum rest frame, possibly related to the local rest
frame of the expanding Universe) may exist without contradicting the apparent
Lorentz invariance felt by ""ordinary"" particles (particles with critical speed
in vacuum equal to $c$ , the speed of light). Sectorial Lorentz invariance,
reflected by the fact that all particles of a given dynamical sector have the
same critical speed in vacuum, will then be an expression of a fundamental
sectorial symmetry (e.g. preonic grand unification or extended supersymmetry)
protecting a parameter of the equations of motion. We study the breaking of
Lorentz invariance in such a scenario, with emphasis on mixing between the
""ordinary"" sector and a superluminal sector, and discuss with examples the
consequences of existing data. The sectorial universality of the value of the
high-energy speed in vacuum, even exact, does not necessarily imply that
Lorentz invariance is not violated and does not by itself exclude the
possibility to produce superluminal particles at accelerators or to find them
in experiments devoted to high-energy cosmic rays. Similarly, the stringent
experimental bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation at low energy cannot be
extrapolated to high-energy phenomena. Several basic questions related to
possible effects of Lorentz symmetry violation are discussed, and potential
signatures are examined.
