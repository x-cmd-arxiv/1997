the data of the homogeneous samples of early--type galaxies studied by Caon

consistent results, the relative distance moduli to Fornax and Coma with
respect to Virgo being Dmu(FV)=0.45+-0.15 and Dmu(CV)=3.55+-0.15) respectively.
The formal error on D(m-M) may be as small as 0.07 mag (~3% in distance),
provided that all the sources of bias are taken into account and a correct
statistical approach is used. Much of the actual uncertainty in the relative
distance of the clusters (12-15%), is due to the existence of systematic
departures in the measurements of the velocity dispersions among the various
datasets, and to the corrections for aperture effects. The above result for the
Fornax cluster is supported by the L-sigma-mu relation and, with lesser
accuracy, by the log(m)-log(re) relations. Our value of Dmu(FV) is in fair
agreement with the one derived using planetary nebulae and SNe-Ia, while is in
open contrast with that coming from surface brightness fluctuations, globular
clusters luminosity function, and infrared Tully-Fisher relation. In our data
Coma appears slightly nearer than indicated by the other distance indicators,
but now a better agreement with the Tully-Fisher relation seems to exist.
Finally we found that there aren't correlations of the residuals of the
Dn-sigma with the effective surface brightness, the total luminosity of the
galaxies, with the ellipticity and the shape parameter a4. Instead a
correlation seems to exists with maximum Vrot, with (V/sigma) and with the
exponent m of the r^1/m fit to major axis light of galaxies.

the survey is dominated by a population of galaxies with narrow optical

galaxies, with special emphasis on possible modifications of the Hubble ""tuning

Hubble's morphological types were defined in terms of standards observed at
small look-back times that were mostly located in the field, or in poor
clusters. It is pointed out that it is often difficult to shoehorn galaxies
located in the cores of rich clusters, or objects viewed at large look-back
times, into the Hubble classification system. The evolutionary relationships
between E, S0 and dSph galaxies are presently still controversial and poorly
understood. It is suggested that S0 galaxies may have arrived at their present
morphology along various evolutionary tracks. Late-type barred spirals are
found to be systematically less luminous than normal late-type galaxies. This
suggests that the dichotomy between normal and barred spirals may reflect
significant differences in their evolutionary histories. Such differences might
be explored by searching for systematic differences between the [O/Fe] values
in normal and barred spirals. Finally it is pointed out that the Large
Magellanic Cloud may have been a low surface brightness galaxy for an ~8 Gyr
period that ended 3-5 Gyr ago. This suggests that some galaxies can jump from
one morphological classification type to another.

weaker bursts at a high confidence level. The very weakest bursts have a
different shape (i.e., a different stretched exponential index) of their

large to be explained by trigger effects and Poisson noise. We interpret these
correlations as being the result of an intrinsic positive correlation between

that such a correlation can be observed should impose new constraints on the

suggests that measurement errors and ``astrophysical errors'' (such as
non-circular gas motion) on the H-alpha velocity widths are below 6%, and
optical widths are nearly as good for TFR studies as 21-cm widths. The scatter
and form of the TFR are found to be robust under choice of velocity
width-extraction algorithm, as long as the central portions of the optical

identifications were obtained using long exposures with the LDSS-2 spectrograph
on the William Herschel Telescope and demonstrate the capability of that
instrument to new limits, $R\simeq$24; the lensing magnification implies true
source magnitudes as faint as $R\simeq$25. Statistically, our measured
redshifts are in excellent agreement with those predicted from Kneib et al.'s
lensing analysis which gives considerable support to the redshift distribution
derived by the lensing inversion method for the more numerous and fainter

arising from both the mass distribution in the central regions of Abell 2218

discuss this result in the context of redshift distributions estimated from

suggest that photometric techniques may achieve a reasonable level of agreement

subsequent works on supersonic ambipolar diffusion, including C-type jets and

  The evolution away from jump shocks toward the numerous steady C-shock
sub-types is then investigated. The evolution passes through four stages, which
possess distinctive observational properties. The time scales and length scales
cover broad ranges. Specific results are included for shock types including
switch, absorber, neutralised, oblique, transverse and intermediate. Only
intermediate Type II shocks and `slow shocks', including switch-off shocks,
remain as J-type under the low ion levels assumed. Other shocks transform via a
steadily growing neutral precursor to a diminishing jump. For neutralised
shocks, this takes the form of an extended long-lived ramp.
  Molecular hydrogen emission signatures are presented. After the jump speed
has dropped to under 25 km/s, a non-dissociative jump section can dominate the
spectra for a long period. This produces a high-excitation spectrum. Once the
jump has further weakened, to < 8 km/s, the fully developed ion front is
responsible for brisk progress towards a constant C-type excitation. The time
scale for emission-line variations is ~(6 /n_i) yr, where n_i is the pre-shock

only a finite subset of the standard Rindler-like modes defined outside the
black hole horizon. The entropy $S_R$ of the Rindler modes, or entanglement
entropy, is always ultraviolet divergent, while the entropy of the ""physical""
modes is finite and it coincides in the induced gravity with $S^{BH}$. The two
entropies $S^{BH}$ and $S_R$ differ by a surface integral Q interpreted as a
Noether charge of non-minimally coupled scalar constituents of the model. We
demonstrate that energy E and Hamiltonian H of the fields localized in a part
of space-time, restricted by the Killing horizon $\Sigma$, differ by the
quantity $T_H Q$, where $T_H$ is the temperature of a black hole. The first law
of the black hole thermodynamics enables one to relate the probability
distribution of fluctuations of the black hole mass, caused by the quantum
fluctuations of the fields, to the probability distribution of ""physical"" modes
over energy E. The latter turns out to be different from the distribution of
the Rindler modes. We show that the probability distribution of the ""physical""
degrees of freedom has a sharp peak at E=0 with the width proportional to the
Planck mass. The logarithm of number of ""physical"" states at the peak coincides
exactly with the black hole entropy $S^{BH}$. It enables us to argue that the
energy distribution of the ""physical"" modes and distribution of the black hole
mass are equivalent in the induced gravity. Finally it is shown that the
Noether charge Q is related to the entropy of the low frequency modes
propagating in the vicinity of the bifurcation surface $\Sigma$ of the horizon.

temperatures rise with decreasing impact parameter from 4 MeV for peripheral to
about 10 MeV for the most central collisions.
  The good agreement with the breakup temperatures measured previously for
projectile spectators at an incident energy of 600 MeV per nucleon confirms the
observed universality of the spectator decay at relativistic bombarding
energies. The measured temperatures also agree with the breakup temperatures
predicted by the statistical multifragmentation model. For these calculations a
relation between the initial excitation energy and mass was derived which gives
good simultaneous agreement for the fragment charge correlations.
  The energy spectra of light charged particles, measured at $\theta_{lab}$ =
150$^{\circ}$, exhibit Maxwellian shapes with inverse slope parameters much
higher than the breakup temperatures. The statistical multifragmentation model,
because Coulomb repulsion and sequential decay processes are included, yields
light-particle spectra with inverse slope parameters higher than the breakup
temperatures but considerably below the measured values. The systematic
behavior of the differences suggests that they are caused by
light-charged-particle emission prior to the final breakup stage.

second moments. The modes are introduced in a self-consistent fashion with the
help of a suitable application of linear response theory. Quantum effects in
the fluctuations are governed by diffusion coefficients D_{\mu\nu}. The latter
are obtained through a fluctuation dissipation theorem generalized to allow for
a treatment of unstable modes. Numerical evaluations of the D_{\mu\nu} are
presented. We discuss briefly how this picture may be used to describe global
motion within a locally harmonic approximation. Relations to other methods are
discussed, like ""dissipative tunneling"", RPA at finite temperature and
generalizations of the ""Static Path Approximation"".

in which the fundamental units may have more than 2 states). In particular, we
consider codes derived from finite symplectic geometry assumed to have
additional global symmetries. From this standpoint, the analogues of
Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes and of GF(4)-linear codes turn out to be special
cases of the same construction. This allows us to construct families of quantum
codes from certain codes over number fields; in particular, we get analogues of
quadratic residue codes, including a single-error correcting code encoding one
letter in five, for any alphabet size. We also consider the problem of
fault-tolerant computation through such codes, generalizing ideas of Gottesman.
