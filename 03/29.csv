  This principal theorem essentially says the following : given an ample line
bundle O(1) on a projective variety X and a fixed upper bound M on the
multiplicities, there exists a lower bound D such that any generic union of
multiple points of multiplicity at most M imposes independent conditions on the

investigated by means of numerical integration of the two-dimensional
Fokker-Planck equation in energy--angular momentum space. The two- dimensional
Fokker-Planck equation allows the development of velocity anisotropy. We
include a spectrum of stellar masses in this paper. The radial anisotropy
develops, that is, the radial velocity dispersion exceeds the tangential one,
in the outer halo of multi-mass clusters as in single-mass clusters. However,
the evolution of the velocity anisotropy depends significantly on the stellar
mass in some cases. In fact the tangential velocity dispersion becomes dominant
around the half-mass radius for massive components in clusters with a steep
mass function. The development of this tangential anisotropy is closely related
to the initial cooling of the massive components toward energy equipartition.
Our simulation results indicate that multi-mass anisotropic King-Michie models
are not always appropriate for describing the velocity anisotropy in globular
clusters.

confirm that the positron fraction does not increase with energy above ~10 GeV,

At low energies the positron fraction is slightly larger than that reported

Since, inflation has had almost as much impact on cosmology as the big-bang
model itself. However, unlike the big-bang model, it has little observational
support. Hopefully, that situation is about to change as a variety and
abundance of data begin to test inflation in a significant way. The
observations that are putting inflation to test involve the formation of
structure in the Universe, especially measurements of the anisotropy of the
cosmic background radiation. The cold dark matter models of structure formation
motivated by inflation are holding up well as the observational tests become
sharper. In the next decade inflation will be tested even more significantly,
with more precise measurements of CBR anisotropy, the mean density of the
Universe, the Hubble constant, and the distribution of matter, as well as
sensitive searches for the nonbaryonic dark matter predicted to exist by
inflation. As an optimist I believe that we may be well on our way to a
standard cosmology that includes inflation and extends back to around 10^{-32}
sec, providing an important window on the earliest moments and fundamental
physics.

possibility of instantons, vacuum phase transitions, vacuum defects (monopoles,
domain walls, cosmic strings and nontopological solitons), vacuum energy, and
degenerate vacua states (with different local realizations of the laws of
physics). Cosmology offers a unique laboratory for exploring the ``physics of
nothing.'' In this lecture I focus on the implications of vacuum energy for

characteristic point of this new scheme is to take the fermion field to be a
vector in a 24-dimensional space which contains all leptons and quarks.
Corresponding to this specification, all gauge and Higgs boson fields are
represented in $24\times 24$ matrix forms. We incorporate two Higgs doublet
bosons $h$ and $SU(2)_R$ adjoint Higgs $\xi_R$ which are as usual transformed
as $(2,2^\ast,0)$ and $(1,3,-2)$ under $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)$,
respectively. Owing to the revise of the algebraic rules in a new NCG, we can
obtain the necessary potential and interacting terms between these Higgs bosons
which are responsible for giving masses to the particles included. Among the
Higgs doublet bosons, one CP-even scalar boson survives in the weak energy
scale and other four scalar bosons acquire the mass of the $SU(2)_R\times U(1)$
breaking scale, which is similar to the situation in the standard model.
$\xi_R$ is responsible to spontaneously break $SU(2)\ma{R} \times U(1)$ down to
$U(1)\ma{Y}$ and so well explains the seesaw mechanism. Up and down quarks have
the different masses through the vacuum expectation value of $h$.

universal quantum computer. Both first and second quantized descriptions are
considered, and the relative computational complexities are determined in each
case. In order to accommodate fermions using a first quantized Hamiltonian, an
efficient quantum algorithm for anti-symmetrization is given. Finally, a
simulation of the Hubbard model is discussed in detail.
