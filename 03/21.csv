potential energy). In this paper, we present another similarity between these
sources. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of GRO J1744-28 show that at
least 10 out of 94 bursts are followed by quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO)
with frequencies of about 0.4 Hz. The period of the oscillations decreases over
their 30--80 s lifetime, and they occur during a spectrally hard ``shoulder''
(or ``plateau'') which follows the burst. In one case the QPO show a modulation
envelope which resembles simple beating between two narrow-band oscillations at
0.325 and 0.375 Hz. Using EXOSAT observations, Lubin et al. found QPO with
frequencies of 0.039 to 0.056 Hz following 10 out of 95 type II bursts from the
Rapid Burster. As in GRO J1744-28, the period of these oscillations decreased
over their 100 s lifetime, and they occurred only during spectrally hard
``humps'' in the persistent emission. Even though the QPO frequencies differ by
a factor of 10, we believe that this is further evidence that a similar
accretion disk instability is responsible for the type II bursts from these two
sources.

strong Li lines in the spectra of some low mass K giant stars (de la Reza et

during a short time ($\sim 10^5 yr$) when compared to the red giant phase of 5
10^7 yr. In this ``Li period'', a large part of the stars are associated with
an expanding thin circumstellar shell supposedly triggered by an abrupt
internal mixing mechanism resulting in a surface new ^7Li enrichment. This
letter presents near 40 Li rich K giants known up to now. The distribution of
these Li rich giants, along with other 41 observed K giants that have shell,
but are not Li rich, in a color-color IRAS diagram confirms this scenario,
indicating, also as a new result, that a rapid Li depletion takes place on a
time scale of between $\sim 10^3$ and 10^5 yr. This model explains the problem
of the presence of K giants with far infrared excesses presented by Zuckerman

pre-BATSE missions of absorption lines in gamma-ray burst spectra and the
absence of a BATSE line detection necessitates a statistical analysis of this
discrepancy. This analysis requires a calculation of the probability that a
line, if present, will be detected in a given burst. However, the connection
between the detectability of a line in a spectrum and in a burst requires a
model for the occurrence of a line within a burst. We have developed the
necessary weighting for the line detection probability for each spectrum
spanning the burst. The resulting calculations require a description of each
spectrum in the BATSE database. With these tools we identify the bursts in
which lines are most likely to be detected. Also, by assuming a small frequency
with which lines occur, we calculate the approximate number of BATSE bursts in
which lines of various types could be detected. Lines similar to the Ginga
detections can be detected in relatively few BATSE bursts; for example, in only
~20 bursts are lines similar to the GB 880205 pair of lines detectable. Ginga
reported lines at ~20 and ~40 keV whereas the low energy cutoff of the BATSE
spectra is typically above 20 keV; hence BATSE's sensitivity to lines is less
than that of Ginga below 40 keV, and greater above. Therefore the probability
that the GB 880205 lines would be detected in a Ginga burst rather than a BATSE
burst is ~0.2. Finally, we adopted a more appropriate test of the significance
of a line feature.

polarization of SN 1993J evolved from being essentially negligible on April
3-4, to a peak value of ~ 1% in late April 1993, and started to decline by the
middle of May. The polarized flux spectrum in late April strongly resembled
spectra of Type Ib supernovae, with prominent He I lines but redshifted ~ 3380
km/s relative to the total flux spectrum. These data are consistent with models
of Hoflich; they suggest that the polarization was most likely produced by
either an asymmetric helium core configuration of material and/or flux, or
scattering from an asymmetric circumstellar distribution of dusty material. A
combination of electron and dust scattering, as well as a clumpy or stratified
distribution of the emitting gas, are possible as the polarization mechanism of
the continuum and emission lines. The latter interpretation is supported by the
fact that 1-2 months after the explosion, the observed rotations of
polarization position angle across prominent line features remain even after
correction for effects of interstellar polarization. This indicates that
emission lines of He I, Fe II, [O I], and H are all intrinsically polarized at
position angles different from that of the continuum, with the non-Balmer lines
generally being most highly polarized. If the supernova had an oblate geometry,
our data are consistent with a small viewing angle (i.e., more or less
equator-on), although the degree of asphericity that gave rise to the
polarization at early times is probably smaller (minor to major axis ratio >
0.7) than has been previously suggested.

a non-singular regular vacuum; and (c) the creation rate is initially higher

for $H$ then has a remarkably simple exact solution, in which a non-adiabatic
inflationary era exits smoothly to the radiation era, without a reheating

independent of the two latter physical parameters. The osmotic and disjoining
pressures are found to coincide at the free energy minimum, while the total
quadrupole moment of the electric double-layer formed by the platelet and the

equation-of-state is calculated for a variety of physical conditions. The limit
of vanishing platelet concentration is considered in some detail, and the force
acting between two coaxial platelets is calculated in that limit as a function

homological invariants, corresponding to infinite dimensional representations

normalized characters converge. Also, we find an approximation theorem for
residually finite $p$-groups ($p$ is a prime), where we use the homology with
coefficients in a finite field $\fp$.
  We view sequences of finite dimensional flat bundles of growing dimension as
examples of growth processes. We study a von Neumann category with a Dixmier
type trace, which allows to describe the asymptotic invariants of growth
processes. We introduce a new invariant of torsion objects, the torsion
dimension. We show that the torsion dimension appears in general as an
additional correcting term in the approximation theorems; it vanishes under
some arithmeticity assumptions. We also show that the torsion dimension allows
to establish non-triviality of the Grothendieck group of torsion objects.
