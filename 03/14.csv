requires that the accretion flow in this object must consist of two components:
a cold outer accretion disk and an extremely hot inner advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF). In quiescence, the model predicts a spectrum which is in
good agreement with observations, with most of the observed radiation coming
from the ADAF. By fitting the observed spectrum, we estimate the mass accretion
rate of the quiescent system and the transition radius between the disk and the
ADAF. We present a detailed numerical simulation of a dwarf-nova type
instability in the outer disk. The resulting heat front reaches the ADAF cavity
promptly; however, it must then propagate inward slowly on a viscous time
scale, thereby delaying the onset of the X-ray flux. The model reproduces the
observed optical and X-ray light curves of the April 1996 outburst, as well as
the 6-day X-ray delay. Further, the model gives an independent estimate of the
quiescent mass accretion rate which is in very good agreement with the rate
estimated from fitting the quiescent spectrum. We show that a pure thin disk
model without an ADAF zone requires significant tuning to explain the X-ray
delay; moreover, such a model does not explain the quiescent X-ray emission of

at relevant resolutions, for box-sizes, $r$, between cutoffs given by the
average rod length $<\ell>$ and the average inter-rod distance $r_1$, these
systems exhibit apparent fractal behavior. It is shown that unlike the case of
randomly distributed isotropic objects, the upper cutoff $r_1$ is not only a
function of the coverage but also depends on the excluded volume, averaged over
the orientational distribution. Moreover, the apparent fractal dimension also
depends on the orientational distributions of the rods and decreases as it
becomes more anisotropic. For box sizes smaller than $<\ell>$ the box counting
function is determined by the internal structure of the rods, whether simple or
itself fractal. Two examples are considered - one of regular rods of one
dimensional structure and rods which are trimmed into a Cantor set structure
which are fractals themselves. The models examined are relevant to adsorption
of linear molecules and fibers, liquid crystals, stress induced fractures and
edge imperfections in metal catalysts. We thus obtain a distinction between two
ranges of length scales: $r < <\ell>$ where the internal structure of the
adsorbed objects is probed, and $<\ell> < r < r_1$ where their distribution is
probed, both of which may exhibit fractal behavior. This distinction is
relevant to the large class of systems which exhibit aggregation of a finite
density of fractal-like clusters, which includes surface growth in molecular
beam epitaxy and diffusion-limited-cluster-cluster-aggregation models.

an effective mu is generated by the VEV of S, leading to a natural solution to
the mu problem. There are a variety of scenarios leading to acceptably small
Z-Z' mixing and other phenomenological consequences, all of which involve some
but not excessive fine tuning. One class, driven by a large trilinear soft
supersymmetry breaking term, implies small mixing, a light Z' (e.g., 200 GeV),
and an electroweak phase transition that may be first order at tree level. In
another class, with m_S^2 < 0 (radiative breaking), the typical scale of
dimensional parameters, including M_{Z'} and the effective mu, is O(1 TeV), but
the electroweak scale is smaller due to cancellations. We relate the soft
supersymmetry breaking parameters at the electroweak scale to those at the
string scale, choosing Yukawa couplings as determined within a class of string
models. We find that one does not obtain either scenario for universal soft
supersymmetry breaking mass parameters at the string scale and no exotic
multiplets contributing to the renormalization group equations. However, either
scenario is possible when the assumption of universal soft breaking is relaxed.
Radiative breaking can also be generated by exotics, which are expected in most

R-matrices. The conjecture is proved in certain cases.

It
explains the violation of Bell's inequality by maintaining realism and the
principle of locality. Schrodinger's cat paradox and the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox are solved, too. The new approach assumes the
universal validity of the Schrodinger equation, while von Neumann's postulates
about the measurement process are replaced with a new, consistent set of
postulates. The underlying idea is that quantum states depend on quantum
reference systems in a fundamental way. Quantum reference systems (a new
concept, first introduced in this paper) are themselves physical systems which
contain the system to be described.

parsimonious `adiabatic' computation. This is contingent on logical
reversibility of computation. An example is the idea of quantum computations
which are reversible except for the irreversible observation steps. We propose
to study quantitatively the exchange of computational resources like time and
space for irreversibility in computations. Reversible simulations of
irreversible computations are memory intensive. Such (polynomial time)
simulations are analysed here in terms of `reversible' pebble games. We show
that Bennett's pebbling strategy uses least additional space for the greatest
number of simulated steps. We derive a trade-off for storage space versus
irreversible erasure. Next we consider reversible computation itself. An
alternative proof is provided for the precise expression of the ultimate
irreversibility cost of an otherwise reversible computation without
restrictions on time and space use. A time-irreversibility trade-off hierarchy
in the exponential time region is exhibited. Finally, extreme
time-irreversibility trade-offs for reversible computations in the thoroughly
unrealistic range of computable versus noncomputable time-bounds are given.

and time entangled photons at wavelengths of 704 and 1310 nm are produced by
parametric downconversion in KNbO3 and are sent through optical fibers into a
bulk-optical (704 nm) and an all-fiber Michelson-interferometer (1310 nm),
respectively. The two interferometers are located 35 meters aside from one
another. Using Faraday-mirrors in the fiber-interferometer, all birefringence
effects in the fibers are automatically compensated. We obtained two-photon
fringe visibilities of up to 95 % from which one can project a violation of
Bell's inequality by 8 standard deviations. The good performance and the
auto-aligning feature of Faraday-mirror interferometers show their potential
for a future test of Bell's inequalities in order to examine
quantum-correlations over long distances.
