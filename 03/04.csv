investigated by means of high resolution N-body simulations. The simulations
are performed using a newly developed multi-mass scheme which combines a PM
code with a high resolution N-body code. Numerical effects due to time stepping
and gravitational softening are investigated as well as the influence of the
simulation box size and of the assumed boundary conditions. Special emphasis is
laid on the formation process and the influence of various cosmological
parameters. Cosmogonies with massive neutrinos are also considered. Differences
between clusters in the same cosmological model seem to dominate over
differences due differing background cosmogony. The cosmological model can
alter the time evolution of cluster collapse, but the merging pattern remains
fairly similar, e.g. number of mergers and mass ratio of mergers. The gross
properties of a halo, such as its size and total angular momentum, also evolve
in a similar manner for all cosmogonies and can be described using analytical
models. It is shown that the density distribution of a halo shows a
characteristic radial dependence which follows a power law with a slope of
$\alpha=-1$ at small and $\alpha=-3$ at large radii, independent of the
background cosmogony or the considered redshift. The shape of the density
profiles follows the generic form proposed by Navarro et al. (1996) for all
hierarchically clustering scenarios and retains very little information about
the formation process or the cosmological model. Only the central matter
concentration of a halo is correlated to the formation time and therefore to
the corresponding cosmogony. We emphasise the role of non-radial motions of the
halo particles in the evolution of the density profile.

X-ray data of PKS1830-211 observed with ROSAT PSPC. The X-ray spectrum shows
that absorption in excess of the Galactic contribution is highly likely, which
at the redshift of the lensing galaxy ($z_l=0.886$) corresponds to
N$_H=3.5^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\times 10^{22}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$. The effective optical

extinction, the two point optical to X-ray slope \aox\ of PKS1830-211 lies just
within the observed range of quasars. It is argued here that both compact

the friction of the interface is experimentally observed to circulate through a
hysteretic loop. The asymptotic behaviour of the hysteresis loop is approached
exponentially. We describe how this behaviour is connected to the collective
properties of the elastic instabilities suffered by the elastic body as it is
displaced quasistatically. We express the length scale of the exponential in

substrate. The predicted scalings are confirmed numerically.

supersymmetries (meaning here ones that do not close on the Hamiltonian) for
one-dimensional non-linear supersymmetric sigma models. The issue relates to
ambiguities, due to partial integrations in superspace, both in the actual
definition of these supersymmetries and in the Noether definition of the
associated supercharges. The unique consistent forms of both these definitions
have to be determined simultaneously by a process that adjusts the former
definitions so that the associated supercharges do indeed correctly generate
them with the aid of the canonical formalism. The paper explains and
illustrates these matters and gives some new results.

from the TBA equations with the results obtained by the Truncated Conformal

extension of this which includes the particle-particle and hole-hole (PPHH)

is the boundary momentum $k_M$ beyond which the single-particle potential
energy is set equal to zero. This is also the boundary of the model space
within which the PPHH diagrams are calculated. It has been rather uncertain
which value should be used for $k_M$. We have carried out model-space nuclear
matter and neutron matter calculations with and without PPHH diagrams for
various choices of $k_M$ and using several modern nucleon-nucleon potentials.
Our results exhibit a saturation region where the nuclear and neutron matter
matter energies are quite stable as $k_M$ varies. The location of this region
may serve to determine an ""optimum"" choice for $k_M$. However, we find that the
strength of the tensor force has a significant influence on binding energy
variation with $k_M$. The implications for nuclear and neutron matter
calculations are discussed.

smectic liquid crystals undergo electroconvection when subjected to a large
enough potential difference. The resulting counter-rotating vortices form a
very simple convection pattern and exhibit a variety of interesting nonlinear
effects. The linear stability problem for this system has recently been solved.
The convection mechanism, which involves charge separation at the free surfaces
of the film, is applicable to any sufficiently two-dimensional fluid. In this
paper, we derive an amplitude equation which describes the weakly nonlinear
regime, by starting from the basic electrohydrodynamic equations. This regime
has been the subject of several recent experimental studies. The lowest order
amplitude equation we derive is of the Ginzburg-Landau form, and describes a
forward bifurcation as is observed experimentally. The coefficients of the
amplitude equation are calculated and compared with the values independently
deduced from the linear stability calculation.

replaced by Dunkl operators and the generalized exponential kernel K of the
Dunkl transform. In case of the symmetric group $S_N$, our setting includes the
polynomial eigenfunctions of certain Calogero-Sutherland type operators. The
second part of this paper is devoted to the heat equation associated with
Dunkl's Laplacian. As in the classical case, the corresponding Cauchy problem
is governed by a positive one-parameter semigroup; this is assured by a maximum
principle for the generalized Laplacian. The explicit solution to the Cauchy
problem involves again the kernel K, which is, on the way, proven to be
nonnegative for real arguments.
