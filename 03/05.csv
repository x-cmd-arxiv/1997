  It is found that mass transfer is usually stable, so long as the the wind's
specific angular momentum does not exceed the angular momentum per reduced mass
of the system. This holds for both dynamical and thermal timescales. Those
systems which are not stable will usually transfer mass on the thermal

Fundamental Plane (FP), and is obtained by replacing the velocity dispersion
parameter with the difference between the magnitude of a galaxy and that of the
mode of the Gaussian luminosity function of E and S0 galaxies. The dispersion
in the PFP is comparable to that of the standard FP. However, the use of the
mode of the luminosity function to compute the magnitude differences introduces
a systematic uncertainty in the derivation of the PFP relation zero-point, so
that its accuracy for distance determinations does not scale with the square
root of the number of objects used to perform the fit. The method is also
vulnerable to any bias that might affect the estimate of the mode of the
luminosity function. If however the mode of the luminosity function can be
reliably determined, the PFP relation can provide distance estimates with an
accuracy comparable to the FP relation, with the advantage that the use of
photometric parameters alone reduces drastically the observational requirements
of the PFP, in comparison with those of the FP relation. This practical
advantage makes the PFP a very economical distance indication method.

centroid frequency of the higher-frequency peak varies from ~875 to ~1085 Hz.
We detect none of the additional QPO peaks at higher frequencies predicted in

peaks near 45 and 90 Hz whose frequency increases with mass accretion rate. We

conclude that the magnetospheric BFM and the PBM are now unlikely to explain
the kHz QPO in Sco X-1. In order to succeed in doing so, any BFM involving the

collisions and merging of primordial binaries for the origin of BSS. The
observed luminosity functions of BSS in the inner and outer parts of the

period, but the final coalescence may be dynamical and driven to a large degree
by hydrodynamic effects, particularly if there is a critical separation at
which the system becomes dynamically unstable toward merger. Indeed, if weakly
relativistic systems (such as white dwarf-white dwarf binaries) encounter a
point of dynamical instability at some critically close separation, coalescence
may be entirely a classical, hydrodynamic process. Therefore, a proper
investigation of this stage of binary evolution must include three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations. We have constructed equilibrium sequences of
synchronously rotating, equal-mass binaries in circular orbit with a single
parameter - the binary separation - varying along each sequence. Sequences have
been constructed with various polytropic as well as realistic white dwarf and
neutron star equations of state. Using a Newtonian, finite-difference
hydrodynamics code, we have examined the dynamical stability of individual
models along these equilibrium sequences. Our simulations indicate that no
points of instability exist on the sequences we analyzed that had relatively
soft equations of state (polytropic sequences with polytropic index $n=1.0$ and
1.5 and two white dwarf sequences). However, we did identify dynamically
unstable binary models on sequences with stiffer equations of state ($n=0.5$
polytropic sequence and two neutron star sequences). We thus infer that binary
systems with soft equations of state are not driven to merger by a dynamical
instability.

and assuming that B-L is violated spontaneously to generate light neutrino
masses via a seesaw mechanism, it is observed that string theory solutions
generically face the problem of producing an excessive $\nu_L-{\tilde H}$
mixing mass at the GUT scale, which is some nineteen orders of magnitude larger
than the experimental bound of 1 MeV. The suppression of $\nu_L-{\tilde H}$
mixing, like proton longevity, thus provides one of the most severe constraints
on the validity of any string theory solution. We examine this problem in a
class of superstring derived models. We find a family of solutions within this
class for which the symmetries of the models and an allowed pattern of VEVs,
surprisingly, succeed in adequately suppressing the neutrino-Higgsino mixing
terms. At the same time they produce the terms required to generate small
neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism.

  validity of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a highly
  condensed Bose gas","RevTeX, 11 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1414","VUWQO-001","quant-ph",,"  The Bogoliubov method for the excitation spectrum of a Bose-condensed gas is
generalized to apply to a gas with an exact large number $ N$ of particles.
This generalization yields a description of the Schr\""odinger picture field
operators as the product of an annihilation operator $A$ for the total number
of particles and the sum of a ``condensate wavefunction'' $\xi(x)$ and a phonon
field operator $\chi(x)$ in the form $\psi(x) \approx A\{\xi(x) +
\chi(x)/\sqrt{N}\}$ when the field operator acts on the N particle subspace. It
is then possible to expand the Hamiltonian in decreasing powers of $\sqrt{N}$,
an thus obtain solutions for eigenvalues and eigenstates as an asymptotic
expansion of the same kind. It is also possible to compute all matrix elements
of field operators between states of different N.

Schr\""odinger equation from three basic postulates. This new derivation sheds
some light on the thermodynamic character of the quantum formalism. We also
show the formal connection between this derivation and the one previously done
by other means. Some considerations about metaestability are also drawn. We
return to an example previously developed to show how the connection between
both derivations works.
