  http://hea-www.harvard.edu/QEDT/Papers/luminosity.ps.gz",,"10.1086/310673",,"astro-ph",,"  We have derived the quasar luminosity function assuming that the quasar
activity is driven by a thermal-viscous unstable accretion disk around a
supermassive black hole. The instabilities produce large amplitude, long-term
variability of a single source. We take a light curve of a single source and
calculate the luminosity function, from the function of time it spends at each
luminosity. Convolving this with an assumed mass distribution we fit well the
observed optical luminosity function of quasars at four redshifts. As a result
we obtain the evolution of the mass distribution between redshifts 2.5 and 0.5.
The maximum of the active black hole mass function moves towards lower mass by
a factor ~10 at the low redshift. The number of high mass sources declines
rapidly, and so low mass sources become dominant at lower redshift. The main
conclusions are following: 1) The quasar long-term variability due to the disk
thermal-viscous instabilities provides a natural explanation for the observed
quasar luminosity function. 2) The peak of the mass function evolves towards
lower black hole masses at lower redshifts by a factor ~10. 3) High mass
sources die subsequently when redshift gets smaller. 4) The number of high mass
sources declines rapidly, and so low mass sources become dominant at lower
redshift. 5) The periodic outbursts of activity appear as long as the matter is
supplied to the accretion disk. 6) Since the time-averaged accretion rate is
low, the remnant sources (or sources in the low activity phase) do not grow to
very massive black holes. 7) A continuous fuel supply at a relatively low
accretion rate (~0.01 - 0.1 \dot M_{Edd}$) for each single source is required
over the lifetime of the entire quasar population.

the observed value to the LMC (Alcock et al. 1996c). The observed several
microlensing events towards the LMC can be explained by a tidal debris tail

twice that of the disc of the LMC. The LMC stars can either lense stars in the

also differ from Sahu's (1994) LMC-self-lensing model by predicting a higher

the newly discovered correlations of the globular cluster specific frequency
$S_N$ in these galaxies with other galaxy and cluster properties and puts forth
an interpretation of these results. $S_N$ is found to correlate strongly with
measures of the cluster density, such as the velocity dispersion of the cluster
galaxies and the cluster X-ray temperature and luminosity (especially ``local''
X-ray luminosity). Within a cluster, galaxies at smaller projected distances
from the X-ray center are found to have higher values of $S_N$. Taken together,
the scaling of $S_N$ with cluster density and the relative constancy of central
galaxy luminosity suggest a scenario in which globular clusters form in
proportionate numbers to the available mass, but galaxy luminosity
``saturates'' at a maximum threshold, resulting in higher \sn\ values for
central galaxies in denser clusters as well as the suitability of these
galaxies as ``standard candles.'' Thus, these galaxies do not have too many
globular clusters for their luminosity; rather, they are underluminous for
their number of globular clusters.

that the clusters exhibit polymorphism and structural transitions. Upon
quenching, we observe a large hysterisis of the transition temperature,
consistent with recent experiments on lead. In contrast, we find macroscopic
sintering theories to be totally unable to describe the coalescing behaviour of
two small clusters. We attribute this failure to the fact that the nanocrystals
are facetted, while the sintering theories are formulated for macroscopically
smooth crystallites. The time for coalescence from our calculations is
predicted to be much longer than expected from the macroscopic theory. This has
important consequences for the morphology of cluster-assembled materials.

high Bjorken--$x$. However, the $x$ distributions differ considerably;
moreover, H1 sees more events with lower luminosity. Taken separately, the $x$
distributions and the number of observed events are consistent between the two
experiments at the few percent level. However, when combined it becomes clear
that the results of H1 and ZEUS are as (in)compatible with each other as each
is with the Standard Model.

classical observables of correlators using the Weyl correspondence rule. The
resulting equation of motion for the Wigner functional of the density matrix is
found to be of the Liouville type. To illustrate the methods developed, we
explicitly consider a scalar theory with quartic self-interaction and derive
the short time behaviour with the non-interacting thermal density matrix as
initial condition. In the scalar case, the complete correlator hierarchy is
studied and restrictions are derived for spatially homogeneous initial
conditions and systems with unbroken symmetry.

integrating out a massless Dirac fermion is known to give either a

the overlap formalism. We show that the result is parity invariant in contrast
to the formulation using Wilson fermions in the massless limit. This
facilitates a non-perturbative study of three-dimensional massless Dirac
fermions interacting with a gauge field in a parity invariant setting with no
need for fine-tuning.

hydrodynamical model. In contrast to one-fluid hydrodynamics, it accounts for
the finite stopping power of nuclear matter, i.e. for nonequilibrium effects in
the early stage of the reaction. Within this model, we study baryon dynamics in
the BNL-AGS energy range. For the system Au+Au we find that kinetic equilibrium
between projectile and target nucleons is established only after a time
$t_{CM}^{eq}\approx 5~fm/c\simeq 2R_{Au}/\gamma_{CM}$. Observables which are
sensitive to the early stage of the collision (like e.g. nucleon flow)
therefore differ considerably from those calculated in the one-fluid model.
