existence of an ionization cone in this object but also show for the first time
a complex of ionized filaments extending radially from the nucleus out to
distances of 1 kpc. Arcs suggestive of bow shocks are observed at the terminus
of some of these filamentary structures. Most spectacular of all, one of the
structures appears to be a scaled-up version of a Herbig-Haro jet. The velocity
field of the filaments confirms that they represent material expelled from the
nucleus (possibly in the form of `bullets') or entrained in a wide-angle wind
roughly aligned with the polar axis of the galaxy. The motions observed across
the ionization cone are highly supersonic, so high-velocity shocks are likely
to contribute to the ionization of the line emitting gas. However, it is not
clear at present whether shock ionization dominates over photoionization by the
Seyfert 2 nucleus. Extrapolation of the filaments to smaller radii comes to
within 1 arcsec (about 20 pc) of the infrared nucleus, therefore suggesting a
AGN or nuclear starburst origin to these features. The complex of radial
filaments detected in the Circinus galaxy is unique among active galaxies. The
frequency of such events is unknown since only a handful of galaxies have been
observed at the sensitivity level of our present observations. The event in the
Circinus galaxy may represent a relatively common evolutionary phase in the
lives of gas-rich active galaxies during which the dusty cocoon surrounding the
nucleus is expelled by the action of jet or wind phenomena.

an improved separation of the intrinsic CMB signal from noise. Our analysis
demonstrates the existence of common structure in independent data scans at 15

auto-correlation function, a likelihood analysis of our combined results at 15

coherence scale of 4 degrees; the equivalent analysis for a
Harrison-Zel'dovitch model gives a power spectrum normalisation of Q_{rms-ps} =
22^{+10}_{-6} uK. The fluctuation amplitude is seen to be consistent at the 68%
confidence level with that reported for the COBE two-year data for primordial
fluctuations described by a power law model with a spectral index in the range
1.0 \le n \le 1.6. This limit favours the large scale CMB anisotropy being
dominated by scalar fluctuations rather than tensor modes from a gravitational
wave background. The large scale Tenerife and COBE results are considered in

questioned. The attempt to extract a scaling exponent \nu from the correlation
integral n(r) by plotting log(n(r)) vs. log(r) is unreliable unless the
underlying point set is approximately monofractal. The extraction of a spectrum
of generalized dimensions \nu_q from a plot of the correlation integral
generating function G_n(q) by a similar procedure is probably an indication
that G_n(q) does not scale at all. We explain these assertions after defining
the term multifractal, mutually--inconsistent definitions having been confused
together in the cosmology literature. Part of this confusion is traced to a
misleading speculation made earlier in the dynamical systems theory literature,
while other errors follow from confusing together entirely different
definitions of ``multifractal'' from two different schools of thought. Most
important are serious errors in data analysis that follow from taking for
granted a largest term approximation that is inevitably advertised in the
literature on both fractals and dynamical systems theory.

Lorentzian wormholes in Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetimes is calculated as a
result of the spontaneous decay of vacuum due to a real tunneling
configuration. In the magnetic case it only depends on the field theoretical
fine structure constant. We predict that the quantum probability corresponding
to the nucleation of such geodesically complete spacetimes should be actually
negligible in our physical Universe.

involving supersymmetry which we resolve. In particular, by taking into account
the gauge constraint and central charge we explain how the system preserves
supersymmetry despite having different numbers of bosonic and fermionic
variables. The resulting zero-point energy leads to a linear potential
consistent with supersymmetry, and the metric is largely unconstrained. We
discuss implications for type I' string theory and the matrix model proposal
for M theory.

where N=4 supersymmetry is broken spontaneously to N=2 and N=1 with moduli
dependent gravitino masses. The spectrum of the spontaneously broken theory
with lower supersymmetry is in one-to-one correspondence with the spectrum of
the heterotic N=4 string. The mass splitting of the N=4 spectrum depends on the
compactification moduli as well as the three R-symmetry charges. We also show
that, in string theory, chiral theories can be obtained after spontaneous
breaking of extended supersymmetry. This was impossible at the level of field
theory. In the large moduli limit a restoration of the N=4 supersymmetry is
obtained. As expected the graviphotons and some of the gauge bosons become
massive in N=1 vacua. At some special points of the moduli space some of the
N=4 states with non-zero winding numbers and with spin 0 and {1/2} become
massless chiral superfields of the unbroken N=1 supersymmetry. Such vaccua have
a dual type II description, in which there are magnetically charged states with
spin 0 and {1/2} that become massless. The heterotic-type II duality suggests
some novel non-perturbative transitions on the type II side. Such transitions
do not seem to have a geometric interpretation, since they relate type II
vaccua with symmetric worlsheet structure to assymetric ones. The heteroric
interpretation of such a transition is an ordinary Higgsing of an SU(2) factor.
In the case of N=4 --> N=2, the perturbative N=2 prepotential is determined by
the perturbative N=4 BPS states. This observation let us to suggest a method
which determines the exact non-perturbative prepotential of the effective N=2
supergravity using the shifted spectrum of the non-perturbative BPS states of
the underlying N=4 theory.

supersymmetries in the context of interacting p-branes strongly suggest that
the signature of spacetime includes two timelike dimensions. This leads to the
puzzle of how ordinary physics with a single timelike dimension emerges. In
this letter we suggest that the two timelike dimensions could be real, and
belong to two physical sectors of a single theory each containing its own
timelike dimension. Effectively there is a single time evolution parameter. We
substantiate this idea by constructing certain actions for interacting p-branes
with signature (n,2) that have gauge symmetries and constraints appropriate for
a physical interpretation with no ghosts. In combination with related ideas and
general constraints in S-theory, we are led to a cosmological scenario in
which, after a phase transition, the extra timelike dimension becomes part of
the compactified universe residing inside microscopic matter. The internal
space, whose geometry is expected to determine the flavor quantum numbers of
low energy matter, thus acquires a Minkowski signature. The formalism meshes
naturally with a new supersymmetry in the context of field theory that we
suggested in an earlier paper. The structure of this supersymmetry gives rise
to a new Kaluza-Klein type mechanism for determining the quantum numbers of low
energy families, thus suggesting that the extra timelike dimension would be
taken into account in understanding the Standard Model of particle physics.

pattern is stable in an infinite region. However, laboratory and numerical
experiments are carried out in finite domains, and this imposes certain
constraints on the possible patterns. In finite rectangular domains, it is
shown that a regular hexagonal pattern cannot occur if the aspect ratio is
rational. In practice, it is found experimentally that in a rectangular region,
patterns of irregular hexagons are often observed. This work analyses the
geometry and dynamics of irregular hexagonal patterns. These patterns occur in
two different symmetry types, either with a reflection symmetry, involving two
wavenumbers, or without symmetry, involving three different wavenumbers. The
relevant amplitude equations are studied to investigate the detailed
bifurcation structure in each case. It is shown that hexagonal patterns can
bifurcate subcritically either from the trivial solution or from a pattern of
rolls. Numerical simulations of a model partial differential equation are also
presented to illustrate the behaviour.

form of a `reversible' pebble game. While such simulations incur little
overhead in additional computation time, they use a large amount of additional
memory space during the computation. The reacheable reversible simulation
instantaneous descriptions (pebble configurations) are characterized
completely. As a corollary we obtain the reversible simulation by Bennett and
that among all simulations that can be modelled by the pebble game, Bennett's
simulation is optimal in that it uses the least auxiliary space for the
greatest number of simulated steps. One can reduce the auxiliary storage
overhead incurred by the reversible simulation at the cost of allowing limited
erasing leading to an irreversibility-space tradeoff. We show that in this
resource-bounded setting the limited erasing needs to be performed at precise
instants during the simulation. We show that the reversible simulation can be
modified so that it is applicable also when the simulated computation time is
unknown.
