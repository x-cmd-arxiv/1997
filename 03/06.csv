surfaces in P^4, not of general type, in degrees varying from 12 up to 14, and
to describe their geometry. By using mainly syzygies and liaison techniques, we
construct the following families of surfaces:
  - minimal proper elliptic surfaces of degree 12 and sectional genus 13,
  - two types of non-minimal proper elliptic surfaces of degree 12 and
sectional genus 14,
  - non-minimal K3 surfaces of degree 13 and sectional genus 16, and -
non-minimal K3 surfaces of degree 14 and sectional genus 19.

monitored for more than thirteen years to investigate the nature of the source
of its broad, double-peaked hydrogen Balmer emission lines. The shape of the
lines varied subtly; there was an interval during which the variation in the
ratio of the fluxes of the two peaks appeared to be sinusoidal, with a period
of 2.16 years and an amplitude of about 16% of the average value. The variable
part of the broad H-alpha line is well fit by a model in which a region of
excess emission (a quiescent ``hot spot'') within an accretion disk (fitted to
the non-varying portion of the double-peaked line) completes at least two
circular orbits and eventually fades. Fits to spectra from epochs when the hot
spot is not present allow determination of the disk inclination, while fits for
epochs when it is present provide a measurement of the radius of the hot spot's
orbit. From these data and the period of variation, we find that the mass
within the hot spot's orbit is 2.2 +0.2/-0.7 times 10^8 solar masses, within
the range of previous estimates of masses of active galactic nuclei. Because
this mass is determined at a relatively small distance (~1000 AU) from the
central body, it is extremely difficult to explain without assuming that a
supermassive black hole lies within Arp 102B. The lack of any systematic change
in the velocity of the blue peak over time yields a lower limit on the combined
mass of the two bodies in a binary black hole model like that of Gaskell (1983)
of 10^10 solar masses.

important for the present discussion because it is not seriously affected by
obscuration. There is reasonably convincing evidence that the distribution of
exponential disk central surface brightnesses is bimodal. Disks avoid the
domain between the high and low surface brightness zones. The few intermediate
surface brightness examples in the sample all have significant nearby
neighbors. The high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies exhibit a range
-21<M(B)<-17 while the low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies are found with
-19<M(B) down to the completion limit. HSB and LSB galaxies in the overlap
regime -19<M(B)<-17 that are indistinguishable in luminosity-line width plots
have very distinct locations in surface brightness-scale length plots. The
existence of separate HSB and LSB families suggests that there are discrete
radial configurations that are stable. Galaxies are driven into one of these
regimes. The HSB state has a lower luminosity cutoff. It is likely that the HSB
galaxies are dominated by dissipational matter at their centers while the LSB
galaxies are dark matter dominated. The HSB family subdivides into those with,
and without, substantial bulges. Evidently, there are two thresholds probably
controlled by angular momentum content or transfer. Passing from high to low
specific angular momentum, there is first the transition from LSB to HSB
regimes, then the transition from exponential disk to disk plus bulge regimes.

which agree well with those for the Coma cluster. The RMS scatter of the Leo I

of 9.01 +/- 0.51, 8.77 +/- 0.43, and 8.82 +/- 0.31, respectively, with a
weighted mean of 8.84 +/- 0.23. The general agreement among the three colors

  The Coma-Leo I distance ratio coupled with estimates of the absolute distance
to the Leo I group allows the Hubble constant to be determined, free of the
uncertainties which arise when working with the Virgo cluster. Several high
quality distance estimates are available from a variety of techniques: Cepheids

Freedman, & Madore 1996). Adopting a cosmic recession velocity of the Coma

quiescence and outburst, using multi-temperature plasma models for the
continuum and line emission, together with their reflection from the X-ray
illuminated white dwarf and accretion disk. Reflection is clearly detected in
all the spectra, but its contribution is larger in the softer X-ray spectra
seen in outburst than in quiescence. This supports models in which the
quiescent inner disk is not present or not optically thick, so that the only
reflector is the white dwarf surface rather than the white dwarf plus the disk.
We detect partially ionized absorption in the ASCA outburst spectrum, which is
probably the X-ray signature of the outflowing wind. The ASCA data also allow a
detailed measure of the elemental abundances. We find that all detectable lines
from the hot plasma (except perhaps Si and S) are a factor $\sim 2.5\times$
weaker than expected from solar abundances. We examine possible deviations from
coronal equilibrium, but conclude that the heavy elements are truly
underabundant in SS Cyg.
  In quiescence the underlying intrinsic spectrum is consistent with a single
temperature plasma. This conflicts with the expected cooling of the material,
and requires that either the plasma is reheated or that the cooler emission is
masked by absorption in an optically thin inner disk which affects only that
part of the boundary layer emission below the disk. By contrast, the outburst
spectrum is much softer and is dominated by the cooling components but has a
total hot plasma luminosity similar to that in quiescence, showing that the
optically thin plasma emission is important even in outburst.

there is no detectable change in the relationship of optical velocity
dispersion to X-ray temperature with redshift. Most cosmological simulations
driven primarily by gravity predict substantial changes in the L-T relation due
to the recent rapid growth of clusters. Our results are consistent either with
models in which the cluster core entropy is dominated by pre-heating, or with
low Omega models in which cluster structure does not evolve strongly with time.
The intrinsic variance in the L-T relation at a fixed redshift can be due a
variety of possibilites e.g. a change in the baryonic fraction from cluster to

order to understand the interplay between defect induced states, enhanced

In-chain and off-chain substitutions quench the spin-Peierls state and induce
3D antiferromagnetic order at T\leq 5 K. Consequently a suppression of a 1D
gap-induced mode as well as a constant intensity of a spinon continuum are
observed at low temperatures. A 3D two-magnon density of states now gradually
extends to higher temperatures T\leq 60K compared with pure CuGeO_3. This
effect is more pronounced in the case of off-chain substitutions (Si) for which
a N\'eel state occurs over a larger substitution range, starting at very low
concentrations. Besides, additional low energy excitations are induced. These
effects, i.e. the shift of a dimensional crossover to higher temperatures are
due to an enhancement of the spin-spin correlations induced by a small amount
of substitutions. The results are compared with recent Monte Carlo studies on
substituted spin ladders, pointing to a similar instability of coupled,
dimerized spin chains and spin ladders upon substitution.

reviewed and is then applied to analyze the so-called global Liouville
equation. The review is self-contained, elementary and is tailor-made for the
application. It is well-known that the Liouville equation for a smooth, real
field $\phi$ under periodic boundary condition is a reduction of the SL(2,R)
WZNW model on the cylinder, where the WZNW field g in SL(2,R) is restricted to
be Gauss decomposable. If one drops this restriction, the Hamiltonian reduction
yields, for the field $Q=\kappa g_{22}$ where $\kappa\neq 0$ is a constant,
what we call the global Liouville equation. Corresponding to the winding number
of the SL(2,R) WZNW model there is a topological invariant in the reduced
theory, given by the number of zeros of Q over a period. By the substitution
$Q=\pm\exp(- \phi/2)$, the Liouville theory for a smooth $\phi$ is recovered in
the trivial topological sector. The nontrivial topological sectors can be
viewed as singular sectors of the Liouville theory that contain blowing-up
solutions in terms of $\phi$. Since the global Liouville equation is
conformally invariant, its solutions can be described by explicitly listing
those solutions for which the stress-energy tensor belongs to a set of
representatives of the Virasoro coadjoint orbits chosen by convention. This
direct method permits to study the `coadjoint orbit content' of the topological
sectors as well as the behaviour of the energy in the sectors. The analysis
confirms that the trivial topological sector contains special orbits with
hyperbolic monodromy and shows that the energy is bounded from below in this
sector only.

q-alg/9601010, q-alg/9505030 and q-alg/9501026. We discuss four procedures to
generate eigenstates of a complete set of commuting operators starting from the
rest state. One result of this work is the fact that upon deforming to the
quantum Poincar\'e algebra the rest state is split into an infinite number of
states. Another result is that the energy spectrum of these states is discrete.
Some curious residual degeneracy remains: there are states constructed by
applying different operators to the rest state which nevertheless are
indistinguishable by eigenvalues of all the observables in the algebra.

developed. Closed form expressions are given for the action of the generators
of U on the basis vectors of finite dimensional irreducible representations. It
is shown how representation theory of U has a close connection to combinatorial
identities involving summation formulas. A general formula is obtained for the
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $C^{j_1,j_2,j}_{n_1,n_2,m}(h)$ of U. These
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are shown to coincide with those of su(2) for
$n_1+n_2 \leq m$, but for $n_1+n_2 > m$ they are in general a nonzero monomial
in $h^{n_1+n_2-m}$.

  November 1997",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This paper is a response to some recent discussions of many-minds
interpretations in the philosophical literature. After an introduction to the
many-minds idea, the complexity of quantum states for macroscopic objects is
stressed. Then it is proposed that a characterization of the physical structure
of observers is a proper goal for physical theory. It is argued that an
observer cannot be defined merely by the instantaneous structure of a brain,
but that the history of the brain's functioning must also be taken into
account. Next the nature of probability in many-minds interpretations is
discussed and it is suggested that only discrete probability models are needed.
The paper concludes with brief comments on issues of actuality and identity
over time.
