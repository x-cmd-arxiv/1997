near 4.67 micron shows that CO-mantled grains can be aligned in cold molecular
clouds. These observations conflict with a theory of grain alignment which
attributes the polarization in molecular clouds to the effects of cosmic rays:
according to this theory, oblate spheroidal grains with H_2O and CO_2-dominated
ice mantles are spun up to suprathermal energies by molecular evaporation from
cosmic ray impact sites but spin up does not occur for CO-mantled grains.
Motivated by this conflict, we reexamine the effects of cosmic rays on the
alignment of icy grains. We show that the systematic torques produced by cosmic
rays are insufficient to cause suprathermal spin. In principle, the random
torques due to cosmic rays can enhance the efficiency of Davis-Greenstein
alignment by raising the grain rotational temperature. However, a significant
enhancement would require cosmic ray fluxes 6--7 orders of magnitude larger
than the flux in a typical cold cloud.

  Astrophysical Journal Letters, in press",,"10.1086/310645",,"astro-ph",,"  We present analysis of the light curve from the ROSAT HRI monitoring
observations of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 390.3. Observed every three days
for about 9 months, this is the first well sampled X-ray light curve on these
time scales. The flares and quiescent periods in the light curve suggest that
the variability is nonlinear, and a statistical test yields a detection with >6
sigma confidence. The structure function has a steep slope ~0.7, while the
periodogram is much steeper with a slope ~2.6, with the difference partially
due to a linear trend in the data. The non-stationary character of the light
curve could be evidence that the variability power spectrum has not turned over
to low frequencies, or it could be an essential part of the nonlinear process.
Evidence for X-ray reprocessing suggests that the X-ray emission is not from
the compact radio jet, and the reduced variability before and after flares
suggests there cannot be two components contributing to the X-ray short term
variability. Thus, these results cannot be explained easily by simple models
for AGN variability, including shot noise which may be associated with flares
in disk-corona models or active regions on a rotating disk, because in those
models the events are independent and the variability is therefore linear. The
character of the variability is similar to that seen in Cygnus X-1, which has
been explained by a reservoir or self-organized criticality model. Inherently
nonlinear, this model can reproduce the reduced variability before and after
large flares and the steep PDS seen generally from AGN. The 3C 390.3 light
curve presented here is the first support for such models to explain AGN
variability on intermediate time scales from a few days to months.

the distance of the Virgo cluster is important for the determination of the
Hubble constant ($H_0$). The Virgo cluster is thereby often used as an
important stepping stone. The first HST measurement of the distance of a Virgo
galaxy (M100) using Cepheid variables provided a value for $H_0=80(\pm 17)$
km/s/Mpc (Freedman et al. 1994). This measurement was preceeded by a ground
based study of the Virgo spiral NGC4571 (Pierce et al. 1994) formally providing
$H_0= 87\pm7$ km/s/Mpc. These determinations rely on the accuracy with which
the position of this observed spiral galaxy can be located with respect to the
Virgo cluster center. This uncertainty introduces a major error in the
determination of $H_0$, together with the uncertainty in the adopted Virgo
infall velocity of the Local Group. Here we propose the use of spiral galaxies
which show clear signs of being stripped off their interstellar medium by the
intracluster gas of the Virgo cluster as targets for the Cepheid distance
measurements. We show that the stripping process and the knowledge of the
intracluster gas distribution from ROSAT X-ray observations allow us to locate
these galaxies with an at least three times higher precision with respect to
M87 than in the case of other spirals like M100. The X-ray observations further
imply that M87 is well centered within the intracluster gas halo of the Virgo
cluster and that M86 is associated with a group of galaxies and a larger dark
matter halo. The combination of these informations could enable us to locate
the two stripped spiral galaxies quite precisely within the Virgo cluster and
could greatly improve the determination of the Virgo cluster distance.

two ASCA observations of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 390.3. These data were
obtained during the period 1995 January 2 to 1995 October 6 as part of an
intensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign. The soft X-ray flux in the ROSAT
band varied by nearly a factor of four during the campaign, and the
well-resolved light-curve shows several distinct features. Several large
amplitude flares were observed, including one in which the flux increased by a
factor of about 3 in 12 days. Periods of reduced variability were also seen,
including one nearly 30 days long. While the HRI hardness ratio decreased
significantly, it is apparently consistent with that expected due to the
detector during the monitoring period.
  The two ASCA observations were made on 1995 January 15 and 1995 May 5. The
0.5-10.0 keV spectra can be adequately described by an absorbed power-law.
There is no evidence for a soft excess in the ASCA spectra, indicating that the
ROSAT HRI is sampling variability of the X-ray power-law. A broad iron line was
observed in a longer 1993 ASCA observation, and while there is statistical
evidence that the line is present in the 1995 spectra, it could not be resolved
clearly. There is evidence, significant at >90% confidence, that the photon
index changed from 1.7 to 1.82 while the flux increased by 63%. The spectral
change can be detected in the spectra below 5 keV, indicating that the origin
cannot be a change in ratio of reflected to power-law flux. A compilation of
results from ASCA and Ginga observations show that on long time scales the
intrinsic photon index is correlated with the flux.

exponent larger than or equal to one), even if the spectrum behaves non
anomalously. Another cause is what we term an intrinsically anomalous spectrum,
in whose scaling an independent exponent exists, which induces different
scaling properties for small and large length scales (that is, the surface is
not self-affine). In this case, the surface does not need to be super-rough in
order to display anomalous scaling. In both cases, we show how to extract the
independent exponents and scaling relations from the correlation functions, and
we illustrate our analysis with two exactly solvable examples. One is the
simplest linear equation for molecular beam epitaxy , well known to display
anomalous scaling due to super-roughening. The second example is a random

an analytical representation of the internal structure of the sun are
discussed. For a two-parameter family of a non-linear matter density
distribution, the run of mass, pressure, temperature, and luminosity throughout
the sun are expressed in terms of Gauss' hypergeometric function. The system of
differential equations governing hydrostatic equilibrium and energy
conservation for the sun generates another field of application of special
functions.

in particular on its zeros and the associated $q$-Lommel polynomials.

framework of an isobaric model up to energies of about 1 GeV above threshold
for all six isospin channels. The hadronic coupling constants in the model are
determined by fitting to the available experimental data. We give a brief
status report on the state of these models and discuss problems to be attacked
in the future. We include hadronic form factors and show that they are
essential for a proper description of the dynamics even though their inclusion
has to be done carefully in order to preserve gauge invariance. We also
investigate the effects of the K0 electromagnetic form factors for two quark
models on the longitudinal and transverse differential cross sections. It is
found that only the reaction n(e,e'K0)\Lambda is sufficiently sensitive to
extract the K0 form factor.
