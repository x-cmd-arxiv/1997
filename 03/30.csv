  in Physical Review Letters",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.4629",,"cond-mat",,"  Using a frustrated XY model on a lattice with open boundary conditions, we
numerically study the magnetization change near a flux lattice melting
transition at low fields. In both two and three dimensions, we find that the
melting transition is followed at a higher temperature by the onset of large
dissipation associated with the zero-field XY transition. It is characterized
by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs (in 2D) or vortex loops (in
3D). At the upper transition, there is a sharp increase in magnetization, in
qualitative agreement with recent local Hall probe experiments.

spin glass in magnetic field undergoes a mean field like phase transition. We
use a dynamical approach: we simulate large lattices (of volume $V$) and work
out the behavior of the system in limit where both $t$ and $V$ go to infinity,
but where the limit $V \to \infty$ is taken first. By showing that the dynamic
overlap $q$ converges to a value smaller than the static one we exhibit replica
symmetry breaking. The critical exponents are compatible with the ones obtained
by mean field computations.

neutrino experiments.

consistent. We demonstrate how this is mimicked in the matrix model.

A_{\hbar,\eta}(\hat{sl_2}) recently proposed by Khoroshkin, Lebedev and
Pakuliak (KLP). Unlike the work of KLP, we associate to the new algebras the
structure of an infinite Hopf family of algebras in contrast to the one
containing only finite number of algebras introduced by KLP. Bosonic
representation for A_{\hbar,\eta}(\hat{g}) at level 1 is obtained, and it is
shown that, by repeated application of Drinfeld-like comultiplications, a
realization of A_{\hbar,\eta}(\hat{g}) at any positive integer level can be
obtained. For the special case of g=sl_{r+1}, (r+1)-dimensional evaluation
representation is given. The corresponding intertwining operators are defined
and the intertwining relations are also derived explicitly.
