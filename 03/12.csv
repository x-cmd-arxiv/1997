gravity. We have reduced the linearized perturbation equations to a
second-order differential equation which resembles the Schr\""{o}dinger equation
with the potential of a harmonic oscillator. Depending on the signs of energy
and potential terms, eigensolutions can be classified into ``continuum'' and
``discrete'' families. When magnetic field is ignored, the continuum family is
identified as the convective mode, while the discrete family as
acoustic-gravity waves. If the effective adiabatic index $\gamma$ is less than
unity, the former develops into the convective instability. When a magnetic
field is included, the continuum and discrete families further branch into
several solutions with different characters. The continuum family is divided
into two modes: one is the original Parker mode, which is a slow MHD mode
modulated by the gravity, and the other is a stable Alfv\'en mode. The Parker
modes can be either stable or unstable depending on $\gamma$. When $\gamma$ is
smaller than a critical value $\gamma_{cr}$, the Parker mode becomes unstable.
The discrete family is divided into three modes: a stable fast MHD mode
modulated by the gravity, a stable slow MHD mode modulated by the gravity, and
an unstable mode which is also attributed to a slow MHD mode. The unstable
discrete mode does not always exist. Even though the unstable discrete mode
exists, the Parker mode dominates it if the Parker mode is unstable. However,
if $\gamma \ge \gamma_{cr}$, the discrete mode could be the only unstable one.
When $\gamma$ is equal $\gamma_{cr}$, the minimum growth time of the unstable
discrete mode is $1.3 \times 10^8$ years with a corresponding length scale of
2.4 kpc. It is suggestive that the corrugatory features seen in the Galaxy and
external galaxies are related to the unstable discrete mode.

$T_c$, and is threaded with a uniform magnetic field with strength $\sim

on the value of the cosmological constant. The density of cold gas at redshifts
z=3+-1 is obtained from the mean HI column density of DLAs per cosmological
path length. This path length per unit redshift is in turn a sensitive function
of the vacuum density parameter, Omega_v. We compare the total inferred mass of
cold gas at high redshifts to that observed in stars today for flat
cosmologies. We define ""eta"" to be net fraction of the baryonic content of
local galaxies which was expelled since z=3, and use Bayesian inference to
derive confidence regions in the (eta, Omega_v) plane. In all cosmologies we
find that eta<0.4 with at least 95% confidence if <25% of the current stellar
population formed before z=3. The most likely value of eta is negative,
implying a net increase by several tens of percent in the baryonic mass of
galaxies since z=3+-1. On the other hand, recent observations of high metal
abundances in the intracluster medium of rich clusters (Loewenstein & Mushotzky
1996) require that metal-rich gas be expelled from galaxies in an amount
approximately equal to the current mass in stars. Based on our results and the
low metallicity observed in DLAs at z>2, we infer that more than half of the
baryonic mass processed through galaxies must have been assembled and partly
expelled from galaxies after z=2. We expect our constraints to improve
considerably as the size of the DLA sample will increase with the forthcoming

yields the following results. (1) The dense cluster of C IV doublets at 2.432 <
z(abs) < 2.441 shows the weak line of one C IV absorber apparently aligned with
the strong line of a different C IV doublet, i.e., line locked, for two pairs
of C IV absorbers. This is surprising since these absorption lines are
displaced by more than 24000 km/s from the QSO redshift, but it is possible
that these alignments are coincidental. (2) Physical conditions in the Lyman
limit absorber at z(abs) = 2.3150 differ significantly from the Galactic
gaseous halo, and photoionization models require [Si/H] > -0.95 and [Al/H] >
-0.96 for the strongest component of this absorber. Abundances of three other
Lyman limit absorbers are also derived from photoionization models. (3)
Unsaturated C IV and rather strong N V are detected in the associated absorber
at z(abs) = 2.7125. The apparent column density profiles indicate that N V is
affected by unresolved saturation or that the N V absorbing gas does not
completely cover the QSO flux source. From photoionization models we derive
[N/H] > -0.65 and [C/H] > -0.82. (4) We tentatively conclude that the number of
Mg II systems detected per unit redshift is dominated by weak Mg II lines with
rest equivalent width less than 0.3 A.

quantum fluctuation effects, is approximately obtained by simple finite-size

which becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions. The ground state
properties and the one-electron spectral function are obtained for a single
electron interacting with Einstein phonons by a mapping of the lattice problem
onto a polaronic impurity model. The one-electron propagator of the impurity
model is calculated through a continued fraction expansion (CFE), both at zero
and finite temperature, for any electron-phonon coupling and phonon energy. In
contrast to the ground state properties such as the effective polaron mass,
which have a smooth behaviour, spectral properties exhibit a sharp qualitative
change at low enough phonon frequency: beyond a critical coupling, one energy
gap and then more and more open in the density of states at low energy, while
the high energy part of the spectrum is broad and can be explained by a strong
coupling adiabatic approximation. As a consequence narrow and coherent
low-energy subbands coexist with an incoherent featureless structure at high
energy. The subbands denote the formation of quasiparticle polaron states.
Also, divergencies of the self-energy may occur in the gaps. At finite
temperature such effect triggers an important damping and broadening of the
polaron subbands. On the other hand, in the large phonon frequency regime such
a separation of energy scales does not exist and the spectrum has always a
multipeaked structure.

is described; it will work for all systems that possess complete sets of
perennials whose Lie algebras close and which generate a sufficiently large
symmetry groups. The construction leads to a quantum theory including a Hilbert
space, a complete system of operator observables and a unitary time evolution.
The method is applied to the 2+1 gravity. The paper is restricted to the
metric-torus sector, zero cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and it makes strong
use of the so-called homogeneous gauge; the chosen algebra of perennials is
that due to Martin. Two frequent problems are tackled. First, the Lie algebra
of perennials does not generate a group of symmetries. The notion of group
completion of a reparametrization invariant system is introduced so that the
group does act; the group completion of the physical phase space of our model
is shown to add only some limit points to it so that the ranges of observables
are not unduly changed. Second, a relatively large number of relations between
observables exists; they are transferred to the quantum theory by the
well-known methods due to Kostant and Kirillov. In this way, a uniqueness of
the physical representation of some extension of Martin's algebra is shown. The
Hamiltonian is defined by a systematic procedure due to Dirac; for the torus
sector, the result coincides with that by Moncrief. The construction may be
extensible to higher genera and non-zero $\Lambda$ of the 2+1 gravity, because
some complete sets of perennials are well-known and there are no obstructions
to the closure of the algebra.

the zeros of the partition function in the complex mass plane remain on a
curve. In this paper we study the effects of the fermion determinant at nonzero
chemical potential on the Dirac spectrum by means of the resolvent, G(z), of
the QCD Dirac operator. The resolvent is studied both in a one-dimensional U(1)
model (Gibbs model) and in a random matrix model with the global symmetries of
the QCD partition function. In both cases we find that, if the argument z of
the resolvent is not equal to the mass m in the fermion determinant, the
resolvent diverges in the thermodynamic limit. However, for z =m the resolvent
in both models is well defined. In particular, the nature of the limit $z
\rightarrow m$ is illuminated in the Gibbs model. The phase structure of the
random matrix model in the complex m and \mu-planes is investigated both by a
saddle point approximation and via the distribution of Yang-Lee zeros. Both
methods are in complete agreement and lead to a well-defined chiral condensate

world sheets of the spin networks In 2+1 dimensions, this can be accomplished
by working in a lattice dual to a tetrahedral lattice constructed on a face

variables over boundaries or singular lines -- which now always bound three
coloured surfaces -- only contributes when four singular lines intersect at one
vertex and can be explicitly computed producing a 6-j or Racah symbol. We
performed a strong coupling expansion for the free energy. The convergence of
the series expansions is quite different from the series expansions which were
performed in ordinary cubic lattices. In the case of ordinary cubic lattices
the strong coupling expansions up to the considered truncation number of
plaquettes have the great majority of their coefficients positive, while in our

of the string is given by the unique even unimodular Lorentzian lattice
$II_{1,1}$ or $II_{9,1}$, respectively. The former leads to the Borcherds

imaginary simple roots can be exhibited, whereas the DDF construction provides
an explicit Lie algebra basis in terms of purely longitudinal states of the
compactified string in two dimensions. The second example is the Borcherds

$E_{10}$. The imaginary simple roots at level 1, which give rise to irreducible

collision properties, which have not been observed in any other (1+1)
dimensional soliton system so far. In particular, we identify the exciting
possibility of switching solitons between modes by changing the phase. However,
the standard elastic collision property of solitons is regained with specific
choices of parameters.
