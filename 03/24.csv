the value for the mass function allows us to determine the mass of the compact

both classes of objects. We also compare the time-averaged spectrum to that at
the time of gamma-ray outbursts. The spectrum of the average AGN is softer than
that of the extragalactic gamma-ray background. It may be that BL Lacs, which
on average have a harder spectrum than FSRQs, make up the bulk of the
extragalactic background. We also find apparent cut-offs at both low and high
energies in the spectra of FSRQs at the time of gamma-ray outbursts. While the
cut-off at high energies may have something to do with opacity, the cut-off at
low energies may be taken as indication that the gamma-ray emission of FSRQs is

possible by considering the equations of motion of various anomalous averages.
The resulting equation explicitly includes the effect of repeated binary

conditions that dressing of the intermediate states of a collision can be
ignored, this equation is shown to reduce to the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii
equation in the pseudopotential limit. Extending the treatment, we show first
how the occupation of excited (bare particle) states affects the collisions,
and thus obtain the many-body T-matrix approximation in a trap. In addition, we
discuss how the bare particle many-body T-matrix gets dressed by mean fields
due to condensed and excited atoms. We conclude that the most commonly used
version of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation can only be put on a microscopic basis
for a restrictive range of conditions. For partial condensation, we need to
take account of interactions between condensed and excited atoms, which, in a
consistent formulation, should also be expressed in terms of the many-body
T-matrix. This can be achieved by considering fluctuations around the
condensate mean field beyond those included in the conventional finite
temperature mean field, i.e. Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB), theory.

propagating at the speed of light. To show that this $SL(2,R)$ cannot be

compactify the final two dimensions on a two-torus and confirm that it changes
the conformal structure of this two-torus.

Schr\""odinger equation with a help of the Schwinger -- DeWitt expansion. For
many of potentials this expansion is divergent. But there were established
nontrivial potentials for which the Schwinger -- DeWitt expansion is
convergent. These are, e.g., V=g/x^2, V=-g/cosh^2 x, V=g/sinh^2 x, V=g/sin^2 x.
For all of them the expansion is convergent when $g=\lambda (\lambda -1)/2$ and
$\lambda$ is integer. The theories with these potentials have no divergences
and in this meaning they are ""good"" potentials contrary to other ones. So, it
seems natural to pay special attention namely to these ""good"" potentials.
Besides convergence they have other interesting feature: convergence takes
place only for discrete values of the charge $g$. Hence, in the theories of
this class the charge is quantized.

sensors, controller, and actuators are quantum systems and interact coherently

coherent. Unlike conventional semiclassical feedback control of quantum
systems, feedback control by quantum controllers is not stochastic, preserves
the initial state of the controlled system, and can control quantum systems in
ways that are not possible using conventional, incoherent feedback control. In
particular, the target state to which the quantum controller drives the system
can be entangled with another quantum system. This paper investigates quantum
controllers and states necessary and sufficient conditions for a Hamiltonian
quantum system to be observable and controllable by a quantum controller.
