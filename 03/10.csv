that the anomalous location of S1040 in the CMD is likely due to a prior

allow only a few choices of helicity and flavour structure that could roughly
fit the HERA data. The data are instead quite consistent with the Q^2
distribution expected from a leptoquark state. We study the production cross
sections of such a particle at the Tevatron and at HERA. The absence of a

  Feb. 1997",,,"UGI-97-04","hep-ph nucl-th",,"  A dynamical model of confinement based on a microscopic transport description
of the Friedberg-Lee model is extended to explicit color degrees of freedom.
The string tension is reproduced by an adiabatic string formation from the
nucleon ground state. As a particular application, we address the question of
how a charmonium state might be dissociated by the strong color electric fields
when moving through a color electric flux tube and speculate on the importance
of such an effect with respect to the issue of $J/\psi $--suppression observed
in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Furthermore, we show the dynamical
breakup of flux tubes via $q-\bar{q}$-particle production and the
disintegration into mesons. There we encounter some problems within the
Vlasov-type realization of describing the motion of the quarks which can be
resolved by a molecular dynamical approach.

theory involving bosons and fermions which is defined in terms of a set of
simple roots for a Lie superalgebra. It is shown that a simple root system for
a superalgebra has two natural bosonic root systems associated with it which
can be found very simply using Dynkin diagrams; the construction is closely
related to the question of how to recover the signs of the entries of a Cartan
matrix for a superalgebra from its Dynkin diagram. The significance for Toda
theories is that the bosonic root systems correspond to the purely bosonic
sector of the integrable model, knowledge of which can determine the bosonic
part of the extended conformal symmetry in the theory, or its classical mass
spectrum, as appropriate. These results are applied to some special kinds of
models and their implications are investigated for features such as
supersymmetry, positive kinetic energy and generalized reality conditions for
the Toda fields. As a result, some new families of integrable theories with
positive kinetic energy are constructed, some containing a mixture of massless
and massive degrees of freedom, others being purely massive and supersymmetric,
involving a number of coupled sine/sinh-Gordon theories.

the framework of boost-invariant, cylindrically symmetric hydrodynamics. It is
investigated how the inverse widths of the two-particle correlation functions
in out- and side-direction depend on the average transverse momentum of the
particle pair, the initial energy density, and the equation of state of the
system. The QCD transition leads to a time delay in the expansion of the system
and consequently to an enhancement of the ratio of inverse widths in out- and
side-direction. This time-delay signal is found to be particularly strong for
large average transverse momenta of order 1 GeV and initial energy densities
accessible at RHIC. Neutral kaon pair correlation functions, which are not
influenced by final state Coulomb effects and less contaminated by resonance
decays than pion correlation functions, seem to be the ideal tool to detect
this collective time-delay signature of the QCD transition.

prove that the trace functions and correlations functions associated with such

suitable conditions, afford a representations of the modular group of the type
prescribed in string theory. We establish the rationality of conformal weights

generalized Moonshine conjectures of Conway-Norton-Queen and to equivariant
