connected, complex algebraic reductive group G we show that the tensor category
of representations of the dual group $\check G$ is naturally equivalent to a
certain category of perverse sheaves on the loop Grassmannian of G. The above
result has been announced by Ginsburg in \cite{G} and some of the arguments are
borrowed from \cite{G}. However, we use a more ""natural"" commutativity
constraint for the convolution product, due to Drinfeld. Secondly, we give a
direct geometric proof that the global cohomology functor is exact and
decompose this cohomology functor into a direct sum of weights. We avoid the
use of the decomposition theorem of \cite{BBD} which makes our techniques
applicable to perverse sheaves with coefficients over arbitrary commutative
rings. This note includes sketches of (some of the) proofs. The details, as
well as the generalization to representations over arbitrary fields and
commutative rings will appear elsewhere.

with normal crossing singularities on a nonsingular complex projective variety.
This is done by introducing a level structure (which gives rise to
``pre-D-modules''), and then introducing a notion of (semi-)stability and
applying Geometric Invariant Theory to construct a coarse moduli scheme for
semistable pre-D-modules. A moduli is constructed also for the corresponding
perverse sheaves, and the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence is represented by an
analytic morphism between these moduli spaces.

that required to explain the dark matter, but the estimated MACHO mass (~0.4
Msun) is most consistent with stars that should have been seen. Toward the
bulge, the total mass is consistent with that given by dynamical estimates of
the bulge mass, but the observed timescales seem to require that a large
fraction of the bulge is made of brown dwarfs. I discuss possible experiments
to resolve these puzzles. I also discuss several applications of microlensing
to non-dark-matter problems including searching for planets and imaging the
black hole at the center of a quasar with 10^{-10} arcsec resolution.

approximation is considered. In this approximation, which is still quartic in
the annihilation and creation operators, the model is explicitly solvable for
arbitrary space dimension d. The partition function and the correlation
functions are given by finite-dimensional integral representations.
Renormalization effects as well as symmetry breaking can be seen explicitly. It
is shown that the usual mean field approach, based on approximating the
Hamiltonian by a quadratic expression, may be misleading if the
electron-electron interaction contains higher angular momentum terms and the
space dimension is d=3. The perturbation theory of the solvable model is
discussed. There are cases where the logarithm of the partition function has
positive radius of convergence but the sum of all connected diagrams has radius
of convergence zero implying that the linked cluster theorem is not applicable
in these cases.

momentum dependent impurity scattering potential. This model is treated within
a self-consistent calculation to obtain the electronic density of states, the
optical conductivity, and the gap function in a two-dimensional
d_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconductor. It is argued that momentum dependent
scattering from the impurities may lead to extended gapless regions in the gap
function centered around the nodes of the pure d_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconductor.
The associated enhancement of the residual density of states may be responsible
for the rapid decrease of T_c and the increase of the London penetration depth
with hole doping observed in overdoped cuprate superconductors.

space and Hilbert space may not be constructible through any finite procedure.
If this is the case then the ""problem of time"" in quantum cosmology may be a
pseudo-problem, because the argument that time disappears from the theory
depends on constructions that cannot be realized by any finite beings that live
in the universe. We propose an alternative formulation of quantum cosmological
theories in which it is only necessary to predict the amplitudes for any given
state to evolve to a finite number of possible successor states. The space of
accessible states of the system is then constructed as the universe evolves
from any initial state. In this kind of formulation of quantum cosmology time
and causality are built in at the fundamental level. An example of such a
theory is the recent path integral formulation of quantum gravity of
Markopoulou and Smolin, but there are a wide class of theories of this type.
