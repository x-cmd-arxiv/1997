accretion-powered pulsar GX 1+4 with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory/BATSE
large-area detectors has found nearly continuous rapid spin-down, interrupted
by a bright 200-d spin-up episode. During spin-down, the torque becomes more
negative as the luminosity increases (assuming that the 20-60 keV pulsed flux
traces bolometric luminosity), the opposite of what is predicted by standard
accretion torque theory. No changes in the shape of the 20-100 keV pulsed
energy spectrum were detected, so that a very drastic change in the spectrum
below 20 keV or the pulsed fraction would be required to make the 20-60 keV
pulsed flux a poor luminosity tracer. These are the first observations which
flatly contradict standard magnetic disk accretion theory, and they may have
important implications for understanding the spin evolution of X-ray binaries,
cataclysmic variables, and protostars. We briefly discuss the possibility that
GX 1+4 may be accreting from a retrograde disk during spin-down, as previously
suggested.

studied based on background field equations which follow from a string theory.
The metrics in various cases are characterized by a real parameter which
specifies a ratio of the lengths of two independent cycles. When the parameter
is a rational number, the space is asymptotically stretched along a cycle while
the other cycle kept finite. When the parameter is an irrational number, the
lengths of two cycles, as well as the space volume (area), grow in proportion
to the proper time $t$ for an observer sitting at rest in this universe in the
asymptotic region.

beyond a critical value a spontaneous deformation of the surface arises (normal
field instability). The instability is subcritical and leads to peaks of a
characteristic shape. We investigate the neighborhood of this instability
experimentally under the influence of a temporal modulation of the magnetic
field. We use a small vessel, where only one peak arises. The modulation can
either be stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the frequency and
amplitude. We observe a cascade of odd-numbered response-periods up to period
11, and also a domain of even-numbered periods. We propose a minimal model
involving a cutoff-condition which captures the essence of the experimental
observations.

interest, all being defined on the three-dimensional convex set of two-level
quantum systems. Each distribution is, following recent work of Petz and Sudar,
taken to be proportional to the volume element of a monotone metric on that
Riemannian manifold. We apply an entropy-based test (a variant of one recently
developed by Clarke) to determine which of two priors is more noninformative in
nature. This involves converting them to posterior probability distributions
based on some set of hypothesized outcomes of measurements of the quantum
system in question. It is, then, ascertained whether or not the original
relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler distance) between a pair of priors increases
or decreases when one of them is exchanged with its corresponding posterior.
The findings lead us to assert that the maximal monotone metric yields the most
noninformative (prior) distribution and the minimal monotone (that is, the
Bures) metric, the least. Our conclusions both agree and disagree, in certain
respects, with ones recently reached by Hall, who relied upon a less specific
test criterion than our entropy-based one.
