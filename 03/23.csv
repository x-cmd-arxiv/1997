complement of A is determined by a braid monodromy homomorphism from a finitely
generated free group to the pure braid group. Using the Gassner representation
of the pure braid group, we find an explicit presentation for the Alexander
invariant of A. From this presentation, we obtain combinatorial lower bounds
for the ranks of the Chen groups of A. We also provide a combinatorial
criterion for when these lower bounds are attained.

branching structure. We show that the global fractal dimension cannot give an
adequate description of the geometrical structure of cascades because it is
insensitive to the internal anisotropy. In order to give a more elaborate
description we introduce an angular correlation function, which takes into
account the direction of the local growth of the branches of the cascades. It
is demonstrated that the angular correlation function gives a quantitative
description of the directionality and the interrelation of branches. The power
law decay of the angular correlation is evidenced and characterized by an
exponent and an angular correlation length different from the radius of
gyration. It is demonstrated that the overlapping of subcascades has a strong
effect on the angular correlation.

Reports 295, 1 (1998)","10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00050-1",,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  This review is intended to give a pedagogical and unified view on the subject
of the statistics and scaling of physical quantities in disordered electron
systems at very low temperatures. Quantum coherence at low temperatures and
randomness of microscopic details can cause large fluctuations of physical
quantities. In such mesoscopic systems a localization-delocalization transition
can occur which forms a critical phenomenon. Accordingly, a one-parameter
scaling theory was formulated stressing the role of conductance as the
(one-parameter) scaling variable. However, the notion of an order parameter was
not fully clarified in this theory. Based on presently available analytical and
numerical results we focus here on the description of the total distribution
functions and their flow with increasing system size. Still, one-parameter
scaling theory does work in terms of typical values of the local density of
states and of the conductance which serve as order parameter and scaling
variable of the localization-delocalization transition, respectively. Below a
certain length scale, $\xi_c$, related to the value of the typical conductance,
local quantities are multifractally distributed. This multifractal behavior
becomes universal on approaching the localization-delocalization transition
with $\xi_c$ playing the role of a correlation length.
