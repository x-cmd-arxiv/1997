reported as 2-3% peak-to-peak, whereas our data show an amplitude of about 16%

periodic UV fluctuations in this shortest-known period binary system, due to
the cyclically changing aspect of the X-ray heated face of the secondary star
(perhaps a very low mass helium degenerate). However, prior to our
observations, this predicted modulation has not been detected. Employing the
Arons & King formalism, which invokes a number of different physical

Blazars ejecting relativistic radio jets at small angles to the line-of-sight
are the only type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) discovered above 100 MeV. The
gamma-rays apparently originate in the jets which explains the absence of
gamma-ray pair creation attenuation. The bulk Lorentz factor of the radio jets
is much smaller than the Lorentz factors of the emitting particles requiring in
situ particle acceleration such as Fermi acceleration at shocks. The mounting
evidence for a correlation between the optical and gamma-ray emission argues
for the same accelerated electrons emitting the polarized optical synchrotron
photons to be responsible for the high-energy emission. Alternatively, the
gamma-rays could be due to electrons of a secondary origin related to the
energy losses of protons accelerated at the same shocks as the synchrotron
emitting electrons. In this case blazars would produce an observable flux of
high-energy neutrinos. Unified schemes for AGN predict a circum-nuclear warm
dust torus attenuating gamma-rays above ~300 GeV emitted from within a central
sphere of radius ~2 10^4 Schwarzschild radii which rules out external Compton
scattering models as the origin of the TeV gamma-rays from Mrk421 and Mrk501.

measured in seeing sigma_* = .22 arcsec with the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope. Lauer et al. 1996, ApJ, 471, L79 have shown that NGC 4486B is
similar to M31 in having a double nucleus. We show that it also resembles M31
in its kinematics. The velocity dispersion gradient is very steep: sigma
increases from 116 +- 6 km/s at r = 2"" - 6"" to 281 +- 11 km/s at the center.
This is much higher than expected for an elliptical galaxy of absolute
magnitude M_B = -16.8: NGC 4486B is far above the scatter in the Faber-Jackson
correlation between sigma and bulge luminosity. Therefore the King core
mass-to-light ratio, M/L_V = 20, is unusually high compared with normal values
for old stellar populations. We construct dynamical models with isotropic
velocity dispersions and show that they reproduce black hole (BH) masses
derived by more detailed methods. We also fit axisymmetric, three-integral
models. Isotropic models imply that NGC 4486B contains a central dark object,
probably a BH, of mass M_BH = 6^{+3}_{-2} x 10^8 M_sun. However, anisotropic
models fit the data without a BH if the ratio of radial to azimuthal
dispersions is ~ 2 at 1"". Therefore this is a less strong BH detection than the
ones in M31, M32, and NGC 3115. A 6 x 10^8 M_sun BH is 9 % of the mass M_bulge
in stars; even if M_BH is smaller than the isotropic value, M_BH/M_bulge is
likely to be unusually large. Double nuclei are a puzzle because the dynamical
friction timescales for self-gravitating star clusters in orbit around each
other are short. Since both M31 and NGC 4486B contain central dark objects, our
results support models in which the survival of double nuclei is connected with
the presence of a BH (e. g., Tremaine 1995, AJ, 110, 628).

Furthermore, the phase space of the ferroelectric instability is greatly
reduced compared to KNbO3. Antiferrodistortive instabilities exist in

the angle of incidence of the incoming ions or their average penetration depth,

compressible quantum Hall system. The tunneling conductance is non-ohmic, due
to slow relaxation of electromagnetic and Chern-Simons field disturbances
caused by the tunneling electron. Universal results are obtained in the limit
of a large number of channels involved in the relaxation. The tunneling
exponent is found to be a continuous function of the filling factor nu, with a
a slope that is discontinuous at nu=1/2 in the limit of vanishing bulk
resistivity rho_xx. When nu corresponds to a principal fractional quantized
Hall state, our results agree with the chiral Luttinger liquid theories of Wen,
and Kane, Fisher and Polchinski.

Heisenberg dynamics of the observables are obtained as an expansion of the same
type. The dynamic equations for correlation functions result to be
selfconsistent nonlinear equations of the type known from mode-mode coupling
approximations. The approach yields a neccessary condition for the validity of
the presented equations. As a third consequence the static correlations can be
calculated from fluctuation-dissipation theorems, if the observables obey a Lie

As a further test, dynamic and static correlations are calculated for a

different from its value as it appears in the bare heavy quark propagator (S(p)
= 1/vp). The origin of the difference, which is effectively a lattice-induced
renormalization, is the reduction of Lorentz (or O(4)) invariance to
(hyper)-cubic invariance. The renormalization is finite and depends
specifically on the form of the discretization of the reduced heavy quark Dirac
equation. For the Forward Time - Centered Space discretization, we compute this
renormalization non-perturbatively, using an ensemble of lattices at beta = 6.1
provided by the Fermilab ACP-MAPS Collaboration. The calculation makes crucial
use of a variationally optimized smeared operator for creating composite
heavy-light mesons. It has the property that its propagator achieves an
asymptotic plateau in just a few Euclidean time steps. For comparison, we also
compute the shift perturbatively, to one loop in lattice perturbation theory.
The non-perturbative calculation of the leading multiplicative shift in the
classical velocity is considerably different from the one-loop estimate, and
indicates that for the above parameters, v is reduced by about 10-13%.

validity of certain soft-photon amplitudes are examined. We comment on aspects
of their analysis which lead to incorrect conclusions about published
amplitudes and point out important criteria which were omitted from their
analysis.

A",,"10.1364/JOSAA.14.002290",,"physics.optics cond-mat hep-th",,"  It is shown that the two-by-two Jones-matrix formalism for polarization
optics is a six-parameter two-by-two representation of the Lorentz group. The
attenuation and phase-shift filters are represented respectively by the
three-parameter rotation subgroup and the three-parameter Lorentz group for two
spatial and one time dimensions. It is noted that the Lorentz group has another
three-parameter subgroup which is like the two-dimensional Euclidean group.
Possible optical filters having this Euclidean symmetry are discussed in
detail. It is shown also that the Jones-matrix formalism can be extended to
some of the non-orthogonal polarization coordinate systems within the framework
of the Lorentz-group representation.

application, we treat in a unified manner all Kac-Moody algebras of rank 2

A_{n-1}^{(1)}.
