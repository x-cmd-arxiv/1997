constituents of the ubiquitous dark matter. I then discuss the motivations
for-and the fundamentals of-inflationary cosmology, particularly emphasizing
the quantum origin of metric (density and gravity-wave) perturbations.
Inflation addresses the shortcomings of the standard cosmology, specifies the
nature of the dark matter, and provides the ""initial data"" for structure
formation. I conclude by addressing the implications of inflation for structure
formation and discussing the different versions of cold dark matter. The flood
of data-from the Heavens and from Earth-should in the next decade test
inflation and discriminate between the different cold dark matter models.

as piecewise continuous functions on phase space, the variance of the
fluctuations can distinguish classically chaotic and regular motions, thus
providing a novel diagnostic devise of quantum chaos. We uncover several
features of the relaxation fluctuations that are shared by disparate systems

and discuss a number of potential problems with existing analyses. The most
important issue is that of the overall normalization of the hadronic spectral
functions should not be fixed by assuming complete resonance dominance of the
continuum threshold region as it can overestimate the resonance contributions
to spectral integrals by factors as large as $\sim 5$. The second important
uncertainty comes from the assumed location, $s_0$, of the onset of duality
with perturbative QCD, as the extracted quark masses depend very sensitively on
this parameter. The assumption of duality and the requirement of positivity of
$\rho_5(s)$ imposes very severe constraints on the shape of the relevant
spectral function in the dual region, and leads to rigorous lower bounds for
$m_u+m_d$ as a function of $s_0$. In the extractions of $m_s$ we find that the
conventional choice of the value of $s_0$ is not physical. For a more
reasonable choice of $s_0$ we are not able to find a solution that is stable
with respect to variations of the Borel transform parameter. This problem can
be overcome only if the hadronic spectral function is determined up to
significantly larger values of $s$ than is currently possible. Finally, we also
estimate the error associated with the convergence of perturbative QCD
expressions used in the sum rule analyses. Our conclusion is that, taking all
of these issues into account, the resulting sum rule estimates for both
$m_u+m_d$ and $m_s$ could easily have uncertainties as large as a factor of 2.

curvature connections in a dual gauge theory description. The low-energy string
fluctuation spectrum is reproduced exactly by the gauge theory in the case of
vanishing field strength; however, this correspondence breaks down for fixed
nonzero field strength. We show that in many cases the full Born-Infeld action
correctly captures the low-energy spectrum in the case of non-vanishing field
strength. This gives a field theory description of the low-energy physics of
systems of diagonally wound branes and branes at angles as considered by
Berkooz, Douglas and Leigh. This description extends naturally to
non-supersymmetric configurations, where the tachyonic instability associated
with brane-anti-brane systems appears as an instability around a saddle point
solution of the corresponding Yang-Mills/Born-Infeld theory. In some cases, the
field theory description requires a non-abelian generalization of the
Born-Infeld action. We follow Tseytlin's recent proposal for formulating such
an action. In the case of intersecting branes, the non-abelian Born-Infeld
theory produces a transcendental relation which comes tantalizingly close to
reproducing the correct spectrum; however, a discrepancy remains which
indicates that a further clarification of the non-abelian Born-Infeld action
may be necessary.

global N=4 supersymmetry and provides a second hamiltonian structure for a new
N=4 supersymmetric integrable hierarchy defined on N=2 affine supercurrents.
This system is an N=4 extension of at once two hierarchies, N=2 NLS and N=2
mKdV ones. It is related to N=4 KdV hierarchy via a generalized
Sugawara-Feigin-Fuks construction which relates N=2 $\hat{sl(2)\oplus u(1)}$
algebra to ``small'' N=4 SCA. We also find the underlying affine hierarchy for
another integrable system with the N=4 SCA second hamiltonian structure,
``quasi'' N=4 KdV hierarchy. It respects only N=2 supersymmetry. For both new
hierarchies we construct scalar Lax formulations. We speculate that any N=2
affine algebra admitting a quaternionic structure possesses N=4 supersymmetry
and so can be used to produce N=4 supersymmetric hierarchies. This suggests a
way of classifying all such hierarchies.

aim is to highlight the possibility of looking at new hypercomplex groups by
the use of barred operators as fundamental step toward a clear and complete
discussion of HGT.

is given. This famous 3-dimensional difference equation is known to provide a
canonical integrable discretization for most important types of soliton
equations. Similarly to the continuous theory, HBDE is a member of an infinite
hierarchy. The central point of our exposition is a discrete version of the
zero curvature condition explicitly written in the form of discrete
Zakharov-Shabat equations for M-operators realized as difference or
pseudo-difference operators. A unified approach to various types of M-operators
and zero curvature representations is suggested. Different reductions of HBDE
to 2-dimensional equations are considered. Among them discrete counterparts of
the KdV, sine-Gordon, Toda chain, relativistic Toda chain and other typical
examples are discussed in detail.
