contain an equipartition primarily poloidal magnetic field and the effect of
jet density on jet dynamics and structure is evaluated. The jet is precessed at
the origin to excite Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable helical modes. We extensively
compare the structure in these simulations with linear stability theory. The
jet that is dense with respect to the external medium develops a high speed
core surrounded by a less dense sheath consisting of slower moving jet fluid.
These simulations suggest that extended extragalactic jets propagate to such
large distances because they are surrounded by a lobe or cocoon whose density
is less than the jet density. (Abridged abstract.)

  available from http://hea-www.harvard.edu/QEDT/niel/papers/papers.html",,"10.1093/mnras/285.3.L25",,"astro-ph",,"  The soft (\approx 0.1--2.0 keV) X-ray spectra of narrow-line Seyfert 1
galaxies are known to be generally steeper than those of Seyfert 1 galaxies
with broader optical permitted lines. This has been attributed to the presence
of strong soft X-ray excesses, over the hard X-ray power law, in many
narrow-line Seyfert 1s. Here we use the currently available ASCA data to
systematically compare the harder (\approx 2--10 keV) X-ray continua of soft
ROSAT narrow-line Seyfert 1s with those of Seyfert 1s with larger H-beta FWHM.
Our robust and nonparametric testing suggests, with high statistical
significance, that soft ROSAT narrow-line Seyfert 1s have generally steeper
intrinsic hard X-ray continua than Seyfert 1s with larger H-beta FWHM. The hard
photon index trend appears similar to the previously known soft photon index
trend, although with a reduced photon index spread. If the soft X-ray excesses
of all Seyfert 1s are confined to below \approx 1 keV they cannot directly
affect the \approx 2--10 keV spectra studied here. However, as suggested for
the extreme narrow-line Seyfert 1 RE J 1034+393, a strong soft X-ray excess may
affect the accretion disc corona which creates the underlying hard X-ray power
law. If this is occurring, then more detailed study of this physical process
could give clues about the formation of the underlying continua of all
Seyferts. Other effects, such as intrinsic 2--10 keV continuum curvature, could
also lead to the observed photon index trend and need further study.

continuous version of the Lie algebra gl(inf) of infinite matrices with only
finite number of nonzero entries. The gl(lambda) was first introduced by
B.L.Feigin in [1] in connection with the Lie algebra cohomologies of the
differential operators on the complex line. The paper is devoted to the
representation theory of the gl(lambda). The Shapovalov's form determinant is
calculated; it depends polynomially on lambda and the parameters of the
representation. It is natural to include the Hamiltonian Lie algebra of
functions on the hyperboloid to the range of gl(lambda), relating it to the
value lambda = infinity. Thus, every family of representations of gl(lambda)
depending holomorphically on lambda is associated with a holomorphic vector
bundle on the Riemann sphere. The determinant of the Shapovalov's form thus
determines the corresponding line bundle. The Chern class of this bundle is
calculated in two different ways (for every level on the representation). The
comparison of the two formulas yields new combinatorial identities with power
series.
