associate a linear combination of the determinant bundle and the relative

We improve the bound on the order of this element found by Faltings and Chai.
In particular, we obtain an optimal bound when the degree of the line bundle d
is odd and the set of residue characteristics of the base does not intersect
the set of primes p dividing d, such that $p\equiv -1\mod(4)$ and p<2g, where g

entail singularities of transition processes without bifurcations are described
as well. The analogue of the Smale order for general dynamical systems under

of three-jet observables at LEP, different from QCD Sum Rules and Lattice

would allow to extract the b quark mass far from threshold, in contrast to the
other methods described above and it would provide a test of the QCD
Renormalization Group predictions. From our NLO calculation, we have estimated,
by exploring the $\mu$-dependence of our prediction at m_Z, a theoretical
b-quark mass uncertainty of at most 250(MeV) in the DURHAM algorithm, 300(MeV)
for JADE and EM and 500(MeV) for the E algorithm. Furthermore, quark mass
effects are expected to be quite more important in top production at NLC (Next
Linear Collider) and our calculation would be of a great interest.

compared to schemes with enhanced family symmetries only. We illustrate these
ideas in the context of the Pati-Salam gauge group SU(4)xSU(2)_LxSU(2)_R$
supplemented by a U(1)_X gauged family symmetry. In the case of symmetric mass
matrices, two of the solutions of Ramond, Roberts and Ross that may not be

non-symmetric textures, new structures arise in models of this type. To
distinguish between the solutions in this latter case, we performed a numerical
fit to the charged fermion mass and mixing data. The best solution we found

Within the setting of a quantum particle in an electromagnetic field it yields
the standard Feynman-Kac formula for the corresponding Schr\""odinger semigroup.
In this case rigorous criteria for its validity are compiled. Finally,
phase-space path-integral representations for more general quantum Hamiltonians
are derived. These representations rely on a generalized Lie-Trotter formula
which takes care of the operator-ordering multiplicity, but in general is not
related to a path measure.

perform different unitary operations on a data register, depending on the input
to some program register. It is shown that a universal quantum gate array - a
gate array which can be programmed to perform any unitary operation - exists
only if one allows the gate array to operate in a probabilistic fashion. The
universal quantum gate array we construct requires an exponentially smaller
number of gates than a classical universal gate array.

atoms with a relative phase coherence maintained by the detection process. We
study this system for two forms of thermal pumping, both with and without the
influence of inter-atomic collisions. We also examine the effects of pumping on
the phenomenon of collapses and revivals of the relative phase between the
condensates.

quantum well vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs). Langevin
equations are derived on the basis of a generalized rate equation model in
which the influence of competing gain-loss and frequency anisotropies is
included. This reveals how the anisotropies and the quantum well confinement
effects shape the correlations and the magnitude of fluctuations in ellipticity
and in polarization direction. According to our results all parameters used in
the rate equations may be obtained experimentally from precise time resolved
measurements of the intensity and polarization fluctuations in the emitted
laser light. To clarify the effects of anisotropies and of quantum well
confinement on the laser process in VCSELs we therefore propose time resolved
measurements of the polarization fluctuations in the laser light. In
particular, such measurements allow to distinguish the effects of frequency
anisotropy and of gain-loss anisotropy and would provide data on the spin
relaxation rate in the quantum well structure during cw operation as well as
representing a new way of experimentally determinig the linewidth enhancement
factor alpha.
