surfaces, which consist of three blocks such that inside each block all Ext
groups between the sheaves are zero. We show that the ranks of all sheaves in
such a block are the same and the three ranks corresponding to a complete
3-block exceptional collection satisfy a Markov-type Diophantine equation that
is quadratic in each variable. For each Del Pezzo surface, there is a finite
number of these equations; the complete list is given. The 3-string braid group
acts by mutations on the set of complete 3-block exceptional collections. We
describe this action. In particular, any orbit contains a 3-block collection
with the sum of ranks that is minimal for the solutions of the corresponding
Markov-type equation, and the orbits can be obtained from each other via
tensoring by an invertible sheaf and with the action of the Weyl group. This
allows us to compute the number of orbits up to twisting.

method yields physical insight into the maximum-likelihood determinations of
the luminosity and velocity distribution and enables us to conduct a vigorous
Monte Carlo investigation into various systematic effects. We apply our

distribution of RR Lyrae stars is highly non-Gaussian, with kurtoses K_\pi =
2.04, K_\theta = 3.22 and K_z = 4.28 in the three principal directions, but
this has almost no effect on either the best fit or the uncertainty of the
luminosity determination. Indeed, our principal result is that the statistical
parallax method is extremely robust in the face of all systematic effects that
we considered. Our analysis, applied to the Layden et al. RR Lyrae sample,
strictly confirms the majority of their results. The mean RR Lyrae absolute
magnitude is M_V = 0.75 +/- 0.13 at the mean metallicity of the sample <[Fe/H]>
= -1.61, compared to M_V = 0.71 +/- 0.12 obtained by Layden et al. Most of the

molecular cloud due to ambipolar diffusion. This model allows us to follow the
quasi-static evolution of the cloud's core prior to collapse and the subsequent
evolution of the remaining envelope. By neglecting the thermal pressure
gradients in comparison with magnetic stresses and by assuming that the ion
velocity is small compared with the neutral velocity, we are able to find exact
analytic solutions to the MHD equations. We show that, in the case of a
centrally condensed cloud, a core of finite mass collapses into the origin
leaving behind a quasi-static envelope, whereas initially homogeneous clouds
never develop any structure in the absence of thermal stresses, and collapse as
a whole. Prior to the collapse of the core, the cloud's evolution is
characterized by two phases: a long, quasi-static phase where the relevant
timescale is the ambipolar diffusion time (treated in this paper), and a short,
dynamical phase where the characteristic timescale is the free-fall time. The
collapse of the core is an ""outside-in"" collapse. The quasi-static evolution
terminates when the cloud becomes magnetically supercritical; thereafter its
evolution is dynamical, and a singularity develops at the origin-a protostar.
After the initial formation of the protostar, the outer envelope continues to
evolve quasi-statically, while the region of dynamical infall grows with
time-an ""inside-out"" collapse. We use our solution to estimate the magnetic
flux trapped in the collapsing core and the mass accretion rate onto the newly
formed protostar. Our results agree, within factors of order unity, with the

fact that these models allow the possibility of enough inflation and dynamical
compactification of the extra dimensions, we examine in the context of these

inflation lead to constraints on the allowed values taken by the parameters of
these models. A model with a ten dimensional JBD field is able to satisfy the

a bistable medium is studied. A parameter range beyond the nonequilibrium
Ising-Bloch bifurcation is found where traveling domains collapse. Only beyond
a second threshold the repulsive front interactions become strong enough to
balance attractive interactions and asymmetries in front speeds, and form
stable traveling pulses. The analysis is carried out for the forced complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation. Similar qualitative behavior is found in the bistable
FitzHugh-Nagumo model.

forecasting/assimilation models for the North Sea, with the emphasis on the
assimilation schemes. One model is the WAM model, in combination with an
optimal interpolation method (OIP). The other model, DASWAM, consists of the
third generation wave model PHIDIAS in combination with an approximate
implementation of the adjoint method.
  In an experiment over the period February 19 - March 30, 1993, the models are
driven by the same wind field (HIRLAM analysis winds), and the same observation
data set is assimilated. This set consists of a) spectra from three
pitch-and-roll buoys and b) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) spectra from the
ERS-1 satellite. Three analysis/forecast runs are performed: one without
assimilation, one with assimilation of buoy measurements only, and one with all
data assimilated. For validation, observations from four buoys, altimeter data
from ERS-1 and Topex-Poseidon, and scatterometer data from ERS-1 are used.
  A detailed analysis of the ""Wadden Storm"" (February 20-22) shows the very
different nature of the two assimilation schemes: the wave and wind field
corrections of the WAM/OIP scheme are all in the vicinity of the observations,
whereas the DASWAM adjustments are more of a global nature. The impact of some
individual buoy and SAR observations is visualized. A comparison of the
performance of the two schemes is somewhat obscured by the very different
behaviour of the two first-guess runs.
  A statistical analysis over the whole 39-day period gives the following
results. In a comparison with buoy observations it is shown that a positive
impact of wave data assimilation remains until about 12 hours in forecast in

interpretation of CDYB was given by Drinfeld and gave rise to the theory of
Poisson-Lie groups. The classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (CDYBE) is an
important differential equation analagous to CYBE and introduced by Felder as
the consistency condition for the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations for
correlation functions in conformal field theory on tori. Quantization of CDYBE
allowed Felder to introduce an interesting elliptic analog of quantum groups.
It becomes clear that numerous important notions and results connected with
CYBE have dynamical analogs. In this paper we classify solutions to CDYBE and
give geometric interpretation to CDYBE. The classification and interpretation
are remarkably analogous to the Belavin-Drinfeld picture.

decoherence and cooperative decoherence. The scheme operates by pairing each
qubit (two-state quantum system) with an ancilla qubit and by encoding the
states of the qubits into the corresponding coherence-preserving states of the
qubit-pairs. In this scheme, the amplitude damping (loss of energy) is
prevented as well as the phase damping (dephasing) by a strategy called the
free-Hamiltonian-elimination We further extend the scheme to include quantum
gate operations and show that loss and decoherence during the gate operations
can also be prevented.
