amplitude acoustic waves with radiation damping now included. Monochromatic
adiabatic waves, due to unbalanced heating, generate continuously rising
chromospheric temperature plateaus in which the low frequency resonances
quickly die out. All non-adiabatic calculations lead to stable mean
chromospheric temperature distributions determined by shock dissipation and
radiative cooling. For non-adiabatic monochromatic wave excitation, a critical
frequency f_cr ~ 1/25 Hz is confirmed, which separates domains of different
resonance behaviour. For waves of frequency f < f_cr, the resonances decay,
while for waves of f > f_cr persistent resonance oscillations occur, which are
perpetuated by shock merging. Excitation with acoustic frequency spectra
produces distinct dynamical mean chromosphere models where the detailed
temperature distributions depend on the shape of the assumed spectra. The
stochasticity of the spectra and the ongoing shock merging lead to a persistent
resonance behaviour of the atmosphere. The acoustic spectra show a distinct
shape evolution with height such that at great height a pure 3 min band becomes
increasingly dominant. With our Eulerian code we did not find appreciable mass
flows at the top boundary.

a flat Omega=0.2 model, with little dependence on other cosmological parameters
for simulations normalized to the observed cluster abundance. The dynamically
derived local mass-to-light ratio, which has little radial variation, converts
the observed light profile to a mass profile. We find that the scale radius of
the mass distribution, 0.20<= a_rho <= 0.30 (depending on modeling details,

history of (proto-)galaxies with varying axis ratios. More massive and/or
roughly spherical systems reach the threshold-metallicity for a transition to a
multi-phase interstellar medium earlier than less massive, more flattened
systems. Therefore, more flattened, lower-mass systems start to form stars
actively at smaller redshifts. A natural explanation is found in the overall
robustness of the interstellar medium against complete expulsion (blow-away) at
high total masses, and in the prevention of metal enrichment in the outer
regions due to axial outflow along the symmetry axis of a non-spherical
proto-galaxy (blow-out). We suggest that the observed predominance of
spheroidal systems observed at high redshift, e.g. in the Hubble Deep Field, is
due to this effect: At z>2, roundish (proto-)galaxies with total
(dark+baryonic) masses of ~10^11 M_o and/or the inner spheroidal cores of
similarly massive flattened systems sustain a multi-phase interstellar medium,
and therefore a high star-formation rate, whose magnitude depends on the
fraction of baryonic matter in the systems. Conversely, the peak at z~1-2 in
the observed cosmological metal production rate coincides with the epochs of
star formation of lower mass spheroidals, as well as of massive proto-galactic

primarily on the recently discovered population of Lyman-break galaxies at

mock galaxy catalogues subject to identical selection criteria to those applied
to the real data. We find that the expected number of Lyman-break galaxies is
very sensitive to the assumed stellar initial mass function and to the
normalization of the primordial power spectrum. For reasonable choices of these
and other model parameters, it is possible to reproduce the observed abundance
of Lyman-break galaxies in CDM models with $\Omega_0=1$ and with $\Omega_0<1$.
These galaxies generally form from rare peaks at high redshift and, as a
result, their spatial distribution is strongly biased, with a typical bias
parameter, $b\simeq 4$, and a comoving correlation length, $r_0\simeq 4 \mpc$.
The typical sizes of these galaxies, $\sim 0.5\kpc$, are substantially smaller
than those of present day bright galaxies. In combination with data at lower
redshifts, the Lyman-break galaxies can be used to trace the cosmic star
formation history. Most galaxies (in our models and in the data) never
experience star formation rates in excess of a few solar masses per year. Our
models predict that even at $z=5$, the integrated star formation rate is
similar to that measured locally, although less than 1% of all the stars have
formed prior to this redshift. These galaxies mark the onset of the epoch of
galaxy formation that continues into the present day. The basic ingredients of
a consistent picture of galaxy formation may well be now in place.

for interacting fermions, we first bosonize the theory by introducing composite

the fermion degrees of freedom. The saddle point solution of the resulting
matrix field theory reproduces a disordered Hartree-Fock approximation and an
expansion to Gaussian order about the saddle point corresponds to a disordered
RPA-like theory. In the clean limit they reduce to the ordinary Hartree-Fock
and random-phase approximations. We first concentrate on disordered systems,
and perform a symmetry analysis that allows for a systematic separation of the
massless modes from the massive ones. By treating the massive modes in a simple
approximation, one obtains a technically satisfactory derivation of the
generalized nonlinear sigma-model that has been used in the theory of
metal-insulator transitions. The theory also allows for the treatment of other
phase transitions in the disordered Fermi liquid. We further use
renormalization group techniques to establish the existence of a disordered
Fermi-liquid fixed point, and show that it is stable for all dimensions d>2.
The so-called weak-localization effects can be understood as corrections to
scaling near this fixed point. The general theory also allows for studying the
clean limit. For that case we develop a loop expansion that corresponds to an
expansion in powers of the screened Coulomb interaction, and that represents a
systematic improvement over RPA. We corroborate the existence of a Fermi-liquid
fixed point that is stable for all dimensions d>1, in agreement with other
recent field-theoretical treatments of clean Fermi liquids.

thermodynamically stable quasicrystals are predicted for parameters approaching
the limits of mechanical stability of the crystalline structures. The results

$-m R(x,y)$ from a path of length R(x,y) connecting the events $x^i$ and $y^i$.
Using this action in a path integral, one can obtain the Feynman propagator for
a spinless particle of mass m in any background spacetime. If one of the
effects of quantizing gravity is to introduce a minimum length scale $L_P$ in
the spacetime, then one would expect the segments of paths with lengths less
than $L_P$ to be suppressed in the path integral. Assuming that the path
integral amplitude is invariant under the `duality' transformation ${\cal R}\to
L_P^2/R$, one can calculate the modified Feynman propagator in an arbitrary
background spacetime. It turns out that the key feature of this modification is
the following: The proper distance $(\Delta x)^2$ between two events, which are
infinitesimally separated, is replaced by $\Delta x^2 + L_P^2$; that is the
spacetime behaves as though it has a `zero-point length' of $L_P$. This
equivalence suggests a deep relationship between introducing a
`zero-point-length' to the spacetime and postulating invariance of path
integral amplitudes under duality transformations. In the Schwinger's proper
time description of the propagator, the weightage for a path with proper time s
becomes $m(s+L_P^2/s)$ rather than as ms. As to be expected, the ultraviolet
behavior of the theory is improved significantly and divergences will disappear
if this modification is taken into account. Implications of this result are
discussed.

hadronically and the other leptonically, i.e., <N_had(2W)> \ne 2 <N_{had}(W)>,
associated with the formation of hadronic clusters by `exogamous' pairs of
partons. We discuss the dependence of this possible difference in multiplicity
on the center-of-mass energy, on the hadron momenta, and on the angular
separation between the $W^{\pm}$ dijets. If it were observed, any such
multiplicity difference would indicate that the W's do not hadronize
independently, and hence raise questions about the accuracy with which the W

lead to defect formation. We find that this region is rather wide, and the GUT
defects are not produced after inflation. This fact shows that the positiveness
of the effective mass square of the field and production of large fluctuations

corresponding expansion $(Q^2)^{-2} \sum_{n,j=0} c_{nj} t^{-n} \ln^j t$, with
$t=Q^2/m^2$ and $j \leq 4$. Results for the coefficients at several first
powers are presented. For a diagram with two non-zero masses, results for all
the logarithms and the leading power, i.e. the coefficients $c_{nj}$ for n=0
and j=4,3,2,1,0 are obtained. A typical feature of these explicit formulae
(written through a sum over a specific family of subgraphs of a given graph,
similar to asymptotic expansions for off-shell limits of momenta and masses) is
an interplay between ultraviolet, collinear and infrared divergences which
represent themselves as poles in the parameter $\eps=(4-d)/2$ of dimensional
regularization. In particular, in the case of the second diagram, which is free
from the divergences, individual terms of the asymptotic expansion involve all
the three kinds of divergences resulting in poles, up to $1/\eps^4$, which are
successfully canceled in the sum.

in the regimes of very large and very small radii a of the background space.
For the gauge symmetry broken in the flat limit ($a \to \infty$) there is a
critical value of a for which the symmetry is restored in both quantum states.
Moreover, the phase transitions which occur at large or at small a are of the
first or of the second order, respectively, regardless the vacuum considered.

move freely through the lattice without being pinned. Numerical simulations
reveal that kink dynamics in this system is significantly less dissipative than
that of the conventional discrete phi^4 system, so that even on extremely

argued, therefore, that this is a natural discretization for the purpose of
