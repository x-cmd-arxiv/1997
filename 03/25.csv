the X-ray fluxes of 8 low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE). The characteristics of these QPOs are remarkably
similar from one source to another. In particular, the highest observed QPO
frequencies for 6 of the 8 sources fall in a very narrow range: 1,066 to 1,171
Hz. This is the more remarkable when one considers that these sources are
thought to have very different luminosities and magnetic fields, and produce
very different count rates in the RXTE detectors. Therefore it is highly
unlikely that this near constancy of the highest observed frequencies is due to
some unknown selection effect or instrumental bias. In this letter we propose
that the highest observed QPO frequency can be taken as the orbital frequency
of the marginally stable orbit. This leads to the conclusions that the neutron
stars in these LMXBs are inside their marginally stable orbits and have masses
in the vicinity of 2.0 solar masses. This mass is consistent with the
hypothesis that these neutron stars were born with about 1.4 solar masses and
have been accreting matter at a fraction of the Eddington limit for 100 million

  NATO ASI Series C433, Kluwer, p. 415-440 (1994)",,,"astro-ph",,"  In recent years, our knowledge of photospheric magnetic fields went through a
thorough transformation--nearly unnoticed by dynamo theorists. It is now
practically certain that the overwhelming majority of the unsigned magnetic
flux crossing the solar surface is in turbulent form (intranetwork and hidden
fields). Furthermore, there are now observational indications (supported by
theoretical arguments discussed in this paper) that the net polarity imbalance
of the turbulent field may give a significant or even dominant contribution to
the weak large-scale background magnetic fields outside unipolar network areas.
This turbulent magnetic field consists of flux tubes with magnetic fluxes below
1e10 Wb (1e18 Mx). The motion of these thin tubes is dominated by the drag of
the surrounding flows, so the transport of this component of the solar magnetic
field must fully be determined by the kinematics of the turbulence (i.e. it is
""passive""), and it can be described by a one-fluid model like mean-field theory
(MFT). This paper reviews the theory of passive magnetic field transport using
mostly first (and occasionally higher) order smoothing formalism; the most
important transport effects are however also independently derived using
Lagrangian analysis for a simple two-component flow model. Solar applications
of the theory are also presented. Among some other novel findings it is
proposed that the observed unsigned magnetic flux density in the photosphere
requires a small-scale dynamo effect operating in the convective zone and that
the net polarity imbalance in turbulent (and, in particular, hidden) fields may
give a major contribution to the weak large-scale background magnetic fields on
the Sun.

The model generalizes the GISS model of homogeneous isotropic turbulence; the
generalization involves the solution of the GISS equations along a set of
integration paths in wavenumber (k-) space. In order to make the problem
tractable, these integration paths (""cascade lines"") must be chosen in such a
way that the behaviour of the energy spectral function along different cascade
lines should be reasonably similar. In practice this is realized by defining
the cascade lines as the streamlines of a cascade flow; in the simplest case
the source of this flow may be identified with the source function of the
turbulence. Owing to the different approximations involved, the resulting
energy spectral function is not exact but is expected to give good
approximative values for the bulk quantities characterising the turbulent
medium, and for the measure of the anisotropy itself in particular.
  The model is then applied to the case of low Prandtl number thermal
convection. The energy spectral function and the bulk quantities characterizing
the flow are derived for different values of the parameter $S=Ra \sigma$. The
most important new finding is that unlike the anisotropy of the most unstable
mode in linear stability analysis the anisotropy of the turbulence does not
grow indefinitely with increasing S but it rather saturates to a relatively
moderate finite asymptotic value.

correlation function of galaxies, $\xi_0,$ much higher than that expected in
linear perturbation theory. This initially high ``bias'' would consequently
decrease to the near-unityvalues expected from local observations. Such a
``Decreasing Correlation Period'' (DCP), detected in N-body simulations under
certain conditions by several authors, is parametrised in a simple way, ending
at a ``transition'' redshift $z_t.$ Consequences on $w_0,$ the amplitude of the
angular correlation function of faint galaxies (for a fixed apparent magnitude
range), have been estimated. The sensitivity of $w_0$ to $z_t,$ and how this is
affected by the redshift distribution of the galaxies in the sample, by low
redshift spatial correlation function behaviour, by cosmology, and by the rate
at which $\xi_0$ decreases during the DCP, are shown and discussed. This simple
model is intended as a first exploration of the effects of the DCP for a likely
range of parameter space. Comparison with the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) estimate
of $w_0$ (Villumsen et al. 1996) indicates that the DCP is compatible with
observation for values of $z_t$ in the theoretically expected range $z_t
\gtapprox 1.$ However, tighter observational constraints on the HDF redshift
distribution and on low redshift correlation function growth will be needed
either to detect the DCP unambiguously or to constrain $z_t$ to redshifts
greater than those of galaxies in existing surveys.

The line complex basically consists of three components, as previously
reported. A weak red wing of the 6.4 keV fluoresence iron K line is found. A
plausible explanation is Compton scattering in optically thick, cold matter
which can be identified with an obscuring torus or cold gas in the host galaxy.
We also show that this `Compton shoulder' should be observable with ASCA using
a simulated reflection spectrum. In order to explain the two higher energy
lines as well as the cold 6.4 keV line, we fit the ASCA data with a composite
model of cold and warm reflection. This shows that cold reflection dominates
the observed X-ray emission above 4 keV. The two higher energy lines have large
equivalent width with respect to the warm-scattered continuum, suggesting that
efficient resonant scattering operates. The line energies are systematically
lower than those expected from resonant lines for FeXXV and FeXXVI by 100 eV.
The redshifts may be due to either the ionized gas of the warm mirror receding
at a radial velocity of 4000-5000 km/s, or effects of Compton scattering in a
complicated geometry.

obtained, and used to derive an asymptotically exact (at low wavevectors q)

to be of ``Quantum Hexatic"" type, possessing long-range orientational order and
quasi-long-range translational order but with zero shear modulus. Possible
scenaria of the ground-state phase transitions as function of $\alpha$ are

space-based laser interferometer for measuring low-frequency gravitational
waves from galactic and extragalactic sources. LISA is not a pointed
instrument; it is an all-sky monitor with a quadrupolar beam pattern. LISA will
measure simultaneously both polarization components of incoming gravitational
waves, so the data will consist of two time series. All physical properties of
the source, including its position, must be extracted from these time series.
LISA's angular resolution is therefore not a fixed quantity, but rather depends
on the type of signal and on how much other information must be extracted.
Information about the source position will be encoded in the measured signal in
three ways: 1) through the relative amplitudes and phases of the two
polarization components, 2) through the periodic Doppler shift imposed on the
signal by the detector's motion around the Sun, and 3) through the further
modulation of the signal caused by the detector's time-varying orientation. We
derive the basic formulae required to calculate the LISA's angular resolution
$\Delta \Omega_S$ for a given source. We then evaluate $\Delta \Omega_S$ for
two sources of particular interest: monchromatic sources and mergers of
supermassive black holes. For these two types of sources, we calculate (in the
high signal-to-noise approximation) the full variance-covariance matrix, which
gives the accuracy to which all source parameters can be measured. Since our
results on LISA's angular resolution depend mainly on gross features of the
detector geometry, orbit, and noise curve, we expect these results to be fairly
insensitive to modest changes in detector design that may occur between now and
launch. We also expect that our calculations could be easily modified to apply
to a modified design.

proportional to (the dual of) the gradient of the massless free scalar field,
reflecting a symmetry enhanced from $O(2)$ to $O(2)\times O(2)$. More
generally, the massless continuum limit of a spin model with a symmetry given

argument was the m_b^2/s suppression of the background process gamma-gamma (J_z

background processes (in which the m_b^2/s suppression is absent) to the
quasi-two-jet-like events with at least one, but preferably two, tagged
energetic b jets. Within a complete study of the radiative processes, we find
that a sizeable background contribution can come from the helicity-violating
gamma-gamma (J_z = 0) -> bbbar process accompanied by soft gluon emission.
These latter radiative corrections contain a new type of double logarithmic
(DL) terms. We clarify the physical nature of these novel DL corrections.
Despite the fact that the one-loop DL terms are comparable or even larger than
the Born term, fortunately we find that the calculation of the cross section in
the two-loop approximation is sufficient for a reliable evaluation of the

branes, from the corresponding low energy U(Q_1)xU(Q_5) gauge theory. Finite
horizon size at weak coupling requires both Q_1 and Q_5 to be large. We derive
the result in the moduli space approximation (say for Q_1>Q_5) and appeal to
supersymmetry to argue its validity beyond weak coupling. As a result of a
combination of quenched Z_{Q_1} Wilson lines and a residual Weyl symmetry, the
low-lying excitations of the U(Q_1)xU(Q_5) gauge theory are described by an
effective N=4 superconformal field theory with c=6 in 1+1 dimensions, where the
space is a circle of radius RQ_1Q_5. We also discuss the appearance of a
marginal perturbation of the effective conformal field theory for large but
finite values of Q_5.
