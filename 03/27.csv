described by Wardle, using a version of the ZEUS code modified to include a

dimensions, thin sheets parallel to the shock velocity and perpendicular to the
magnetic field lines form. High resolution, two-dimensional models show that
the sheets are confined by the Brandenburg & Zweibel ambipolar diffusion
singularity, forcing them to numerically unresolvable thinness. Hot and cold
regions form around these filaments, disrupting the uniform temperature
structure characteristic of a steady-state C-shock. This filamentary region
steadily grows as the shock progresses. We compare steady-state to unstable
C-shocks, showing excitation diagrams, line ratios, and line profiles for
molecular hydrogen lines visible in the K-band, with the Infrared Space

probing regions close to compact objects, degenerate dwarfs, neutron stars,
stellar black holes and the central engines of AGN. Temporal studies with the
ASM and PCA have already yielded rich results which pertain to the environs,
evolution, and nature of the compact objects in galactic systems. Here I review
some selected results from these instruments, as obtained by various RXTE
observers. The ASM is providing detailed light curves of about 60 detected
sources and has uncovered new temporal/spectral states of galactic binary
systems. The bizarre behavior of the possibly very young binary system, Cir
X-1, is being revealed in detail by both the ASM and the PCA. A rare high/soft
state of the black-hole candidate, Cyg X-1 provides new insight into the nature
of the low/high transitions in black-hole binaries. The PCA has made possible
the discovery of oscillations near 1 kHz in ten low-mass X-ray binary systems.
These are most probably direct indicators of the neutron-star spin in some
cases and probably indirect indicators in others. Studies of microquasars have
unveiled a host of new temporal phenomena which may provide links between
accretion processes and the radio jets in these systems.

L_X(M,z) scale as power laws in mass and epoch, in order to construct expected

luminosity function while the degree of evolution in the X-ray luminosity with
redshift L_X \propto (1+z)^s is left open, with s an interesting free parameter
which we investigate. We examine open and flat cosmologies with initial,
scale-free fluctuation spectra having indices n = 0, -1 and -2. An independent
constraint arising from the slope of the luminosity-temperature relation
strongly favors the n = -2 spectrum.
  The expected counts demonstrate a strong dependence on \Omega_0 and s, with
lesser dependence on \lambda_0 and n. Comparison with the observed counts
reveals a ""ridge"" of acceptable models in the \Omega_0 - s plane, roughly
following the relation s = 6 \Omega_0 and spanning low-density models with a
small degree of evolution to \Omega = 1 models with strong evolution. Models
with moderate evolution are revealed to have a strong lower limit of \Omega_0
\gtrsim 0.3, and low-evolution models imply that \Omega_0 < 1 at a very high
confidence level. We suggest observational tests for breaking the degeneracy
along this ridge, and discuss implications for evolutionary histories of the

equilibrium structure, oxygen is found to buckle slightly out of the plane and,
as a result, the characters of the energy bands near EF are found to be similar
to those of other optimally doped HTSCs. For the EPI we find lambda(s)=0.4, in
accord with previous LDA calculations for YBa2Cu3O7. This supports the common
belief that the EPI mechanism alone is insufficient to explain HTSC.
Lambda(x^2-y^2) is found to be positive and nearly as large as lambda(s). This
is surprising and indicates that the EPI could enhance some other d-wave
pairing mechanism. Like in YBa2Cu3O7, the buckling modes contribute
significantly to the EPI, although these contributions are proportional to the
static buckling and would vanish for flat planes. These numerical results can
be understood from a generic tight-binding model originally derived from the

be a computationally intensive process if a single bank of template wave forms
(i.e., a one step search) is used. In an earlier paper we had presented a
detection strategy, called a two step search}, that utilizes a hierarchy of
template banks. It was shown that in the simple case of a family of Newtonian
signals, an on-line two step search was about 8 times faster than an on-line
one step search (for initial LIGO). In this paper we extend the two step search
to the more realistic case of zero spin 1.5 post-Newtonian wave forms. We also
present formulas for detection and false alarm probabilities which take
statistical correlations into account. We find that for the case of a 1.5
post-Newtonian family of templates and signals, an on-line two step search
requires about 1/21 the computing power that would be required for the
corresponding on-line one step search. This reduction is achieved when signals
having strength S = 10.34 are required to be detected with a probability of
0.95, at an average of one false event per year, and the noise power spectral
density used is that of advanced LIGO. For initial LIGO, the reduction achieved
in computing power is about 1/27 for S = 9.98 and the same probabilities for
detection and false alarm as above.

order 50% in the mass range of interest. We also calculate the leptoquark
average transverse momentum squared and find it to be rather small. Various
leptoquark production cross sections at the Tevatron $p \bar p$ collider are
also considered. We investigate in detail the leptoquark interpretation of the
HERA data. First we assume a minimal leptoquark model with a single diagonal
Yukawa coupling to first family lepton and quark mass eigenstates only. In this
case constraints from atomic parity violating experiments allow only isodoublet
scalar leptoquark production at HERA. This interpretation can be confirmed or
ruled out in the near future by high luminosity data at the Tevatron. The
Tevatron data already appear to rule out the vector leptoquark interpretation
of the HERA data. We also consider a more general model which allows for all
possible left-handed, right-handed, flavour and lepton number changing
couplings. The allowed values of the Yukawa couplings of this general model
offer several different interpretations of the data which are radically
different from the minimal model solutions. However these somewhat ad hoc tuned
solutions can easily be tested by future HERA experiments.

  Review A","Phys.Rev. A56 (1997) 44","10.1103/PhysRevA.56.44",,"quant-ph",,"  A continuous measurement of energy which is sharp (perfect) leads to the
quantum Zeno effect (freezing of the state). Only if the quantum measurement is
fuzzy, continuous monitoring gives a readout E(t) from which information about
the dynamical development of the state vector of the system may be obtained in
certain cases. This is studied in detail. Fuzziness is thereby introduced with
the help of restricted path integrals equivalent to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
For an otherwise undisturbed multilevel system it is shown that this
measurement represents a model of decoherence. If it lasts long enough, the
measurement readout discriminates between the energy levels and the von Neumann
state reduction is obtained. For a two-level system under resonance influence
(which undergoes in absence of measurement Rabi oscillations between the
levels) different regimes of measurement are specified depending on its
duration and fuzziness: 1) the Zeno regime where the measurement results in a
freezing of the transitions between the levels and 2) the Rabi regime when the
transitions maintain. It is shown that in the Rabi regime at the border to the
Zeno regime a correlation exists between the time dependent measurement readout
and the modified Rabi oscillations of the state of the measured system.
Possible realizations of continuous fuzzy measurements of energy are sketched.

  Impurities","20 pages, Latex, no figures",,"10.1088/0305-4470/30/9/019",,"quant-ph",,"  A one-dimensional discrete Stark Hamiltonian with a continuous electric field
is constructed by extension theory methods. In absence of the impurities the
model is proved to be exactly solvable, the spectrum is shown to be simple,
continuous, filling the real axis; the eigenfunctions, the resolvent and the
spectral measure are constructed explicitly. For this (unperturbed) system the
resonance spectrum is shown to be empty. The model considering impurity in a
single node is also constructed using the operator extension theory methods.
The spectral analysis is performed and the dispersion equation for the
resolvent singularities is obtained. The resonance spectrum is shown to contain
infinite discrete set of resonances. One-to-one correspondence of the
constructed Hamiltonian to some Lee-Friedrichs model is established.
