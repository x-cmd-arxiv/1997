strength and inelasticity of weak interactions in hot nuclear matter. Neutrino
interactions with nonrelativistic nucleons are mainly governed by the dynamical
structure function for the nucleon spin density which describes its
fluctuations. It has recently been shown that these fluctuations give rise to a
new mode of energy transfer between neutrinos and nucleons which inside the
neutrinosphere is of comparable or greater importance than ordinary recoil. We
calculate numerically the spin density structure function in the limit of a
dilute, non-degenerate medium from exact two-nucleon wave functions for some
representative nuclear interaction potentials. We show that spectrum and
magnitude of the energy transfer can deviate significantly from those based on
the Born approximation. They are, however, rather insensitive to the particular
nuclear potential as long as it reproduces experimental nucleon scattering
phase shifts at energies up to a few tens of MeV. We also compare with
calculations based on a one-pion exchange potential in Born approximation and
briefly comment on their applicability near the center of a supernova core. Our
study is relevant for numerical simulations of the neutrino spectra emerging
from type-II supernovae.

observations show that dark matter halos represent a one-parameter family with
self similar density profiles. The global halo parameters, like total mass and
scale length are coupled by simple scaling relations. The inner halo regions
resemble non-singular, isothermal spheres with constant density cores. The
observations are compared with dark matter halos, resulting from cosmological
cold dark matter simulations. The theoretical models predict that dark matter
halos represent a one-parameter family in agreement with the observations.
However, in contradiction to the observations, the calculations lead to dark
matter halos with $r^{-1}$ density cusps in the center and non-isothermal
velocity dispersion profiles. Processes which might affect the inner halo

position of a galaxy within this plane is determined by its redshift,

photometry and the published redshifts, we have quantified the

estimates for four models, starting from the standard extragalactic method and
then adding the physical effects of temperature distributions, extinction
distributions, requiring positive definite extinctions, and metallicity. While
we find general agreement with published distances when we make similar
systematic assumptions, there is a clear problem in the standard distances
because they require Cepheids with negative extinctions, particularly in low
metallicity galaxies, unless the mean LMC extinction exceeds E(B-V) > 0.25. The
problem can be explained by the physically expected metallicity dependence of
the Cepheid distance scale, where metal-poor Cepheids are hotter and fainter
than metal-rich Cepheids. For V and I we found that the mean magnitude change
is -0.14 +/- 0.14 mag/dex and the mean color change is 0.13 +/- 0.04 mag/dex,
with the change in color dominating the change in distance. The effect on Type
Ia supernova estimates of the Hubble constant is dramatic because most were
found in the metal poor galaxies with the bluest Cepheids. The Type Ia
Multi-color Light Curve Shape (MLCS) method estimate for H_0 formally rises
from 69 +/- 8 km/s Mpc to 80 +/- 6 km/s Mpc with the metallicity correction.

superconductors in a random pinning potential.
  For the static case we review the prediction that the phase diagram of such
systems consists of a topologically ordered Bragg glass phase, with quasi long
range translational order, at low fields. This Bragg glass phase undergoes a
transition at higher fields into another glassy phase, with dislocations, or a
liquid. This proposition is compatible with a large number of experimental
results on BSCCO or Thalium compounds. Further experimental consequences of our
results and relevance to other systems will be discussed.
  When such vortex systems are driven by an external force, we show that, due
to periodicity in the direction transverse to motion, the effects of static
disorder persist even at large velocity. In $d=3$, at weak disorder, or large
velocity the lattice forms a topologically ordered glass state, the ``moving
Bragg glass'', an anisotropic version of the static Bragg glass. The lattice
flows through well-defined, elastically coupled, static channels. We determine
the roughness of the manifold of channels and the positional correlation
functions. The channel structure also provides a natural starting point to
study the influence of topological defects such as dislocations. In $d=2$ or at
strong disorder the channels can decouple along the direction of motion leading
to a ``smectic'' like flow. We also show that such a structure exhibits an
effective transverse critical pinning force due to barriers to transverse
motion, and discuss the experimental consequences of this effect.

then examine the case with no neutral chiral superfields, so that the goldstino
is charged, and the gauge symmetry is also broken. In this context, we discuss
the singularity structure and the associated unitarity constraints, relating

It is clarified that the relatively low-lying mixed-symmetry states behave like
doorway states. For these nearly spherical nuclei, the lowest mixed-symmetry
state is shown to have $J^P=2^+$. An indication of the mixed-symmetry 3^+ state
is obtained. The sequence of the mixed-symmetry 2^+, 1^+ and 3^+ levels and its
nucleus-dependence are discussed. Calculated M1 and M3 transitions in the
low-energy region suggest that the mixed-symmetry 1^+ and 3^+ components are
detectable. We investigate the B(M1) distribution in a wider energy range,
without breaking the isospin quantum number. It is confirmed that the
mixed-symmetry 1^+ component is well separated from the peak of the spin
excitation. The isospin-raising component has a peak, separated well from the
isospin-conserving one. The orbital angular-momentum contributes destructively
to the spin excitations.

encountered in the quantization of such $n$-ary structures, explain their
reason and present the recently obtained solution combining deformation
quantization with a ""second quantization"" type of approach on ${\Bbb R}^n$. The
solution is called ""Zariski quantization"" because it is based on the
factorization of (real) polynomials into irreducibles. Since we want to
quantize composition laws of the determinant (Jacobian) type and need a Leibniz
rule, we need to take care also of derivatives and this requires going one step
further (Taylor developments of polynomials over polynomials). We also discuss
a (closer to the root, ""first quantized"") approach in various circumstances,
especially in the case of covariant star products (exemplified by the case of
su(2)). Finally we address the question of equivalence and triviality of such
deformation quantizations of a new type (the deformations of algebras are more
general than those considered by Gerstenhaber).
