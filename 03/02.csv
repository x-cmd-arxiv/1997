with the relativistic effect of magnetic-field dissipation during collapse into
a black hole taken into account.
  A burst-type solution can be obtained both for a direct collapse and for the
formation of a rapidly-rotating, self-gravitating object - a spinar - using a
simple model. Analytical dependences on radius describing an electromagnetic
burst are derived. The time dependence of the burst shape for an infinitely
distant observer and the maximum energy of relativistic particles accelerated
by an electric field are numerically calculated.
  The objects under consideration are of particular interest because particles
in their vicinity can be accelerated up to the Planck energies. Possible
astrophysical applications to the theory of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and
QSOs are briefly discussed. It is shown for the first time that a spinar can be
produced by a merger of neutron stars; this possibility is considered in and
without connection with the formation of gamma-ray bursts.

methods. Typically, these wave functions consist of a sum of a small number of
Slater determinants multiplied by a Jastrow factor. In this paper we study the
importance of including high-order, nucleus-three-electron correlations in the
Jastrow factor. An efficient algorithm based on the theory of invariants is
used to compute the high-body correlations. We observe significant improvements
in the variational Monte Carlo energy and in the fluctuations of the local
energies but not in the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energies. Improvements
for the ground states of physical, fermionic atoms are found to be smaller than
those for the ground states of fictitious, bosonic atoms, indicating that
errors in the nodal surfaces of the fermionic wave functions are a limiting
factor.

long-range order in the Hubbard bilayer with an arbitrary chemical potential.
With this operator and a constraint condition on annihilation and creation
operators, we construct explicitly eigenstates which possess simultaneously
three kinds of off-diagonal long-range order, i.e., the intralayer one and the
interlayer one for on-site pairing, and that for interlayer nearest-neighbor
pairing. As in the simple Hubbard model there is also an SO(4) symmetry, with
the the generators properly defined. A sufficient condition leads to at least
one of the above three kinds of off-diagonal long-range order. A constraint
relation among different kinds of off-diagonal long-range order is also given.
There exists a triplet of collective modes if the U(1) symmetry of a subgroup
is spontaneously broken.

experimental data via Neural Network (NN) or similar devices: Let $N$ data be
given, such that $N=N_s+N_b$, where $N_s$ is the number of signals, $N_b$ the
number of background events, both unknown. Assume that a NN has been trained,
such that it will tag signals with efficiency $F_s$, $(0<F_s<1)$ and background
data with $F_b$, $(0<F_b<1)$. Applying the NN yields $N^Y$ tagged events. We
demonstrate that the knowledge of $N^Y$ is sufficient to calculate confidence
bounds for the signal likelihood, which have the same statistical
interpretation as the Clopper-Pearson bounds for the well-studied case of
direct signal observation. Subsequently, we discuss rigorous bounds for the
a-posteriori distribution function of the signal probability, as well as for
the (closely related) likelihood that there are $N_s$ signals in the data. We
compare them with results obtained by starting off with a maximum entropy type
assumption for the a-priori likelihood that there are $N_s$ signals in the data
and applying the Bayesian theorem. Difficulties are encountered with the latter
method.

gauge theories. Given a two dimensional orientable surface of genus $g$, the
partition function $Z$ is defined for a triangulation consisting of $n$
triangles of area $\epsilon$. The reason these models are called
quasi-topological is that $Z$ depends on $g$, $n$ and $\epsilon$ but not on the
details of the triangulation. They are also soluble in the sense that the
computation of their partition functions can be reduced to a soluble one
dimensional problem. We show that the continuum limit is well defined if the
model approaches a topological field theory in the zero area limit, i.e.,
$\epsilon \to 0$ with finite $n$. We also show that the universality classes of
such quasi-topological lattice field theories can be easily classified.
Yang-Mills and generalized Yang-Mills theories appear as particular examples of
such continuum limits.

integral of a density. Suppose the divergence term in the density of the
Poisson bracket be fixed so that it becomes a bilinear form of densities of two
functionals. Then the left-hand side of the Jacobi identity written in terms of
densities is not necessarily zero but a divergence of a trilinear form. The
question is: what can be said about this trilinear form, what kind of a higher
Jacobi identity (involving four fields) it enjoys? Two examples whose origin is
the theory of integrable systems are given.
