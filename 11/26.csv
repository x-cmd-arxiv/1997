the central masses of galaxies can be measured with a resolution 5 to 10 times

black holes in galaxy nuclei. The discovery of small (r ~ 100-200 pc) rotating
gaseous and stellar disks in the centers of many early-type galaxies provides a
new and efficient means for measuring the central potentials of galaxies.
Concomitantly, VLBI observations of water masers in the nuclei of NGC 4258 and
NGC 1068 revealed exquisite Keplerian rotation curves around massive black
holes at radii as small as 0.1 pc. Recent terrestrial K-band measurements of
the proper motions of stars in the cluster at the center of the Galaxy provide
irrefutable evidence for a black hole with a mass of 2.7E+6 M_sun. At the time
of this symposium, the presence of central massive black holes has been
established in 12 galaxies. The evidence suggests that there are massive black
holes in the centers of all AGNs and in most, if not all, nucleated galaxies.
The present data show at best a weak correlation between black hole mass and

responsible for the production of these lines is photoionization by a
``typical'' active galactic nucleus continuum. The chemical elements vary their
abundance together with oxygen, except nitrogen, which is assumed to be a
product of secondary nucleosynthesis. The calibrations are calculated for the
range $8.4 \le 12+log(O/H) \le 9.4$, and tested using NLR data for a sample of
Seyfert's and LINER's having HII regions in the vicinity of the nucleus. The
gaseous abundances of these HII regions have been determined in previous works,
and the NLR abundances are obtained on the assumption that they can be
extrapolated from those of the HII regions. The calibrations work very well for
the Seyfert's, giving abundance values which agree with those obtained from the
HII regions, and can thus be used for quick estimates of the chemical
abundances of the NLR's. For the LINER's, the calibrations give lower values
than those derived from the corresponding HII regions, suggesting that the
assumptions of the models do not apply for them, and that there are different

though the model has no core-collapse SNe within three kpc of the center, a
considerable fraction of the core-collapse SNe are projected into the inner

The model predicts that because of extinction, SNe projected into the central

scatter than those in the outer regions. In particular, the model predicts a
strong deficit of bright core-collapse events inside a projected radius of a

  held June 30- July 2, 1997 in Chicago, IL",,,,"astro-ph",,"  During the months when the galactic bulge is visible from the southern
hemisphere, there are typically about 8 to 10 on-going microlensing events at
any given time. If the lensing stars have planets around them, then the
signature of the planets can be seen as sharp, extra peaks on the microlensing
light curves. And if every lensing star has a Jupiter around it, then the
probability of detecting an extra spike is of the order of 10%. Thus continuous
and frequent monitoring of the on-going microlensing events, with a sampling
interval of a few hours, provides a powerful new method to search for planets
around lensing stars.
  Such monitoring programs are now being carried out using a network of 1-meter
class telescopes situated at appropriately spaced longitudes in the southern
hemisphere (for example, by PLANET collaboration). However, the galactic bulge
is visible from the south pole throughout this period, and hence a single
automated telescope at the south-pole can provide an efficient means of
carrying out the monitoring program. Up to about 20 events can be monitored
during a single 3-month season with a 1-meter telescope, potentially leading to
the detection of two planetary signals. The telescope can also be used for
several other research projects involving microlensing and variability of
stars.

provides the gap distribution function, the mean scaling dimension for the

identities, all the integrals occurring in the evaluation of a Feynman graph of
given topology can be expressed in terms of a few independent master integrals.
It is shown in this paper that the integration by part identities can be
further used for obtaining a linear system of first order differential
equations for the master integrals themselves. The equations can then be used
for the numerical evaluation of the amplitudes as well as for investigating
their analytic properties, such as the asymptotic and threshold behaviours and
the corresponding expansions (and for analytic integration purposes, when
possible). The new method is illustrated through its somewhat detailed
application to the case of the one loop self-mass amplitude, by explicitly
working out expansions and quadrature formulas, both in arbitrary continuous
dimension n and in the n \to 4 limit. It is then shortly discussed which
features of the new method are expected to work in the more general case of
multi-point, multi-loop amplitudes.

capture the anti-screening behaviour that contributes the dominant `-4' to the

gauge theory in the Hamiltonian formalism and choosing the Coulomb gauge, the
origins of all screening and anti-screening contributions in gluon processes
are found in terms of the physical degrees of freedom. The overwhelming anti-
screening contribution of `-4' is seen to originate in the renormalisation of a
Coulomb interaction by a transverse gluon. The lesser screening contribution of
`1/3' is seen to originate in processes involving transverse gluon
interactions. It is thus apparent how the variational ansatz must be developed

might wonder if secure quantum bit commitment protocols exist at all. We answer
this question by showing that the same type of attack by Alice will, in
principle, break any bit commitment scheme. The cheating strategy generally
requires a quantum computer. We emphasize the generality of this ``no-go

ruled out by this result. Since bit commitment is a useful primitive for
building up more sophisticated protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, our
results cast very serious doubt on the security of quantum cryptography in the

For specific values of the angle parameters and small amplitude of the
canonical CS components these states approaches multimode Fock states with one,
two or three bosons/photons. It is shown that eigenstates of a squared
non-Hermitian operator A^2 (generalized cat states) can exhibit squeezing of
the quadratures of A.

To be published in Optics Communication","Opt. Comm. 149, 152 (1998).","10.1016/S0030-4018(97)00688-3",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider the effect of loss on quantum-optical communication channels. The
channel based on direct detection of number states, which for a lossless
transmission line would achieve the ultimate quantum channel capacity, is
easily degraded by loss. The same holds true for the channel based on homodyne
detection of squeezed states, which also is very fragile to loss. On the
contrary, the ``classical'' channel based on heterodyne detection of coherent
states is loss-invariant. We optimize the a priori probability for the
squeezed-state and the number-state channels, taking the effect of loss into
account. In the low power regime we achieve a sizeable improvement of the
mutual information, and both the squeezed-state and the number-state channels
overcome the capacity of the coherent-state channel. In particular, the
squeezed-state channel beats the classical channel for total average number of
photons $N<8$. However, for sufficiently high power the classical channel
always performs as the best one. For the number-state channel we show that with
a loss $\eta\lesssim .6$ the optimized a priori probability departs from the
usual thermal-like behavior, and develops gaps of zero probability, with a
considerable improvement of the mutual information (up to 70 % of improvement
at low power for attenuation $\eta=.15$).

are discussed as well as the problems encountered in the numerical computation
of the quantum exponents. Although an example of true quantum chaos may be
exhibited, the taming effect of quantum mechanics on chaos is quite apparent in
the computation of the quantum exponents. However, even when the exponents
vanish, the functionals used for their definition may still provide a
characterization of distinct complexity classes for quantum behavior.
