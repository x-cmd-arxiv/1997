the powerful radio galaxies selected at high and low redshift have different
evolutionary histories, but must contain a similar mass of stars, a few times
10-to-the-power-11 solar masses, and so conspire to produce the `passively
evolving' K-z relation observed. We discuss this model in the context of the

Because the ongoing microlensing observations and extensions of them should be
able to discover planets in wide orbits, we provide a foundation for the search
through detailed calculations and simulations that quantify the expected
results and compare the relative benefits of various search strategies. If
planetary systems similar to our own or to some of the known extra-solar
systems are common, then the predicted detection rates of wide-orbit events are
high, generally in the range 2-10% of the present detection rate for apparently
single events by stars. The expected high rates should allow the microlensing
observing teams to either place significant limits on the presence of planetary
systems in the Galactic Bulge, or begin to probe the population in detail
within the next few years. We also address the issues of (1) whether planets
discovered via microlensing are likely to harbor life, (2) the feasibility of
follow-up observations to learn more about planet microlenses, and (3) the

  In particular, an HI component at the same velocity as the southwestern

between the HII region and M17 SW, in un-shocked PDR gas. We have detected a
steep enhancement in the 20 km/s HI column density and line of sight magnetic
field strengths (Blos) toward this boundary. A lower limit for the peak 20 km/s
HI column density is N_{HI}/T_s > 5.6 x 10^{19} cm^{-2}/K while the peak Blos
is ~ -450 muG. In addition, blended components at velocities of 11-17 km/s
appear to originate from shocked gas in the PDR between the HII region and an
extension of M17 SW, which partially obscures the southern bar of the HII

at cosmological distances can provide an important probe of the physical state
and structure of material at the heart of these complex systems. Applying these
results to the macrolensed BAL quasar system, H1413+117, the observed spectral
variations are readily reproduced, but without the fine-tuning requirements of
earlier studies which employ more simplistic models.

the survival of this radionuclide in thermally pulsing AGB stars. This problem
is made difficult by the high sensitivity to temperature and density of the
rates of the weak interaction processes that are able to produce or destroy
205Pb. In view of this sensitivity, a recourse to detailed stellar models is
mandatory. With the help of some simplifying assumptions concerning in
particular the third dredge-up characteristics, some of which (like its depth)
being considered as free parameters, predictions are made for the 205Pb
contamination of the stellar surface at the end of a pulse-interpulse cycle
following a series of a dozen of pulses in three different intermediate-mass
stars (M=3M_sun,Z=0.02; M=6M_sun,Z=0.02; M=3M_sun,Z=0.001). It is concluded
that the chances for a significant 205Pb surface enrichment are likely to
increase with M for a given Z, or to increase with decreasing Z for a given M.
More specifically, following the considered pulses at least, the enrichment
appears to be rather unlikely in the 3M_sun star with Z=0.02, while it seems to
be much more probable in the other two considered stars. It is also speculated
that the (3M_sun,Z=0.02) star could possibly experience some 205Pb enrichment

  Sanchez, editor, ``Current Topics in Astrofundamental Physics (1997)'',
  Kluwer Academic, 1998",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss three recent developments in the calculation of CMB anisotropies.
First, we consider relativistic corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.
By extending the Kompaneets equation to the relativistic domain we are able to
derive simple analytic forms for the SZ spectral distortion. Second, we discuss
covariant kinetic theory methods for the gauge-invariant calculation of CMB
anisotropies. We present a covariant version of the Boltzmann equation which we
use to derive covariant and gauge-invariant equations describing a CDM model,
which are independent of background curvature and type of perturbation (scalar,
vector or tensor). By integrating the covariant Boltzmann equation along the
line of sight, and using the instantaneous recombination approximation, we
obtain an expression for the large-scale anisotropy which agrees with an
expression derived recently by Dunsby. Third, we discuss recent accurate
calculations of the CMB anisotropy in global defect models of cosmic structure
formation. In such models the effects of vector modes are significant and when
combined with the effects of decoherence lead to a suppression of the Doppler
peaks. The result is that global defect models may already be at variance with
the growing volume of CMB and large scale structure data.

in Virgo. The object was observed with broad-band and H$\alpha$ imaging, UV
observations, and radio synthesis. Our data were combined with published
optical observations, with HI single-beam observation and with FIR data, and
were compared to results of evolutionary synthesis programs. The radio
observations revealed a compact source of HI coincident with the optical
galaxy, embedded in a diffuse, HI cloud which has no trace in the optical.
While the overall velocity dispersion and size of the HI structure suggests
that the total mass in stars and gas is not sufficient to gravitationally bind
the system, the HI clump coincident with the optical galaxy requires little or
no dark matter to be self-gravitating. The optical-UV data can be explained by
a single population of stars formed in a recent burst, indicating that this is
a genuine young galaxy. The efficiency of star formation is similar to that in
large disk galaxies. The IR emission indicates the presence of dust; this must
have been formed very recently, or was already present within the original HI
cloud from which the galaxy was formed. The round and smooth isophotes and HI
redshifts, and the lack of any suitable nearby galaxy, indicate that the
starburst was probably not triggered by an external interaction with a visible
galaxy. The distribution of HI fits better a blow-out scenario than an
accretion or collision with a companion. We point out features in common with
other actively star-forming dwarf galaxies and conclude that, at least in the
southern outskirts of the Virgo cluster, intensive star formation, perhaps for
the first time in some objects, takes place at present.

flip-related (or the appropriate number of symmetry-related in the non-Ising

exhibits at most a pair of delta-functions at plus/minus the self-overlap. This
rules out the nonstandard SK picture introduced by us earlier, and when
combined with our previous elimination of more standard versions of the mean
field picture, argues against the possibility of even limited versions of mean
field ordering in realistic spin glasses. If broken spin flip symmetry should
occur, this leaves open two main possibilities for ordering in the spin glass
phase: the droplet/scaling two-state picture, and the chaotic pairs many-state
picture introduced by us earlier. We present scaling arguments which provide a
possible physical basis for the latter picture, and discuss possible reasons

crucial, and are described by a two-particle S-matrix which has a
super-universal form at low momenta. This is established by computations on the
O(3) $\sigma$-model, and strong and weak coupling expansions (the latter using
a Majorana fermion representation) for the two-leg S=1/2 Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic ladder. As an aside, we note that the strong-coupling
calculation reveals a S=1, two particle bound state which leads to the presence
of a second peak in the T=0 inelastic neutron scattering (INS) cross-section
for a range of values of momentum transfer. We obtain exact, or numerically
exact, universal expressions for the thermal broadening of the quasi-particle
peak in the INS cross-section, for the magnetization transport, and for the
field dependence of the NMR relaxation rate $1/T_1$ of the effective
semiclassical model: these are expected to be asymptotically exact for the
quantum antiferromagnets. The results for $1/T_1$ are compared with the
experimental findings of Takigawa et al and the agreement is quite good. In the

inflation do not lead to infinite open universes, as it was previously thought,
but to an ensemble of very large but finite inflating `islands'. The reason is
that the quantum tunneling responsible for the nucleation of the bubble does
not occur simultaneously along both field directions and equal-time
hypersurfaces in the open universe are not synchronized with equal-density or
fixed-field hypersurfaces. The most probable tunneling trajectory corresponds
to a zero value of the inflaton field; large values, necessary for the second
period of inflation inside the bubble, only arise as localized fluctuations.
The interior of each nucleated bubble will contain an infinite number of such
inflating regions of comoving size of order $\gamma^{-1}$, where $\gamma$
depends on the parameters of the model. Each one of these islands will be a
quasi-open universe. Since the volume of the hyperboloid is infinite, inflating
islands with all possible values of the field at their center will be realized
inside of a single bubble. We may happen to live in one of those patches of
comoving size $d\lesssim \gamma^{-1}$, where the universe appears to be open.
In particular, we consider the ``supernatural'' model proposed by Linde and
Mezhlumian. There, an approximate U(1) symmetry is broken by a tunneling field
in a first order phase transition, and slow-roll inflation inside the nucleated
bubble is driven by the pseudo-Goldstone field. We find that the excitations of
the pseudo-Goldstone produced by the nucleation and subsequent expansion of the
bubble place severe constraints on this model. We also discuss the coupled and
uncoupled two-field models.

massless type IIA superspace vacuum. We find that the extended algebra contains
not only topological charges that probe the presence of compact spacetime
dimensions but also pieces that measure non-trivial configurations of the gauge
field on the worldvolume of the brane. Furthermore there are terms that measure
the coupling of the non-triviality of the worldvolume regarded as a U(1)-bundle
of the gauge field to possible compact spacetime dimensions. In particular, the
extended algebra carried by the D-2-brane can contain the charge of a Dirac
monopole of the gauge field. In the course of this work we derive a set of
generalized Gamma-matrix identities that include the ones presently known for
the IIA case.
  In the first part of the paper we give an introduction to the basic notions
of Noether current algebras and charge algebras; furthermore we find a Theorem
that describes in a general context how the presence of a gauge field on the
worldvolume of an embedded object transforming under the symmetry group on the
target space alters the algebra of the Noether charges, which otherwise would
be the same as the algebra of the symmetry group. This is a phenomenon recently
found by Sorokin and Townsend in the case of the M-5-brane, but here we show
that it holds quite generally, and in particular also in the case of D-branes.

well-defined quantum M-theory necessarily requires the presence of both M-2 and
