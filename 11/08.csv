the ROSAT PSPC. We detected 13 point-like sources in this galaxy, 10 of which
were previously unknown. We measured extended X-ray radiation from almost the
whole optically visible galaxy. Comparing the diffuse soft and hard X-ray
emission components, we observed a different asymmetric distribution and a
slower radial decrease of the intensity profile of the soft X-ray emission.
Both these results support the existence of a huge spherical gas halo of 10-15
kpc radius. On the other hand, the radial scale lengths of the hard X-ray
radiation, that of the thermal radio emission and the profile of the optical
surface brightness are similar, favouring the idea that all these emission
processes are connected to star formation in the galaxy's disk. M83 is the
first face-on galaxy where the diffuse X-ray emission spectrum can be
characterized by a two-temperature thermal plasma: a soft X-ray emitting warm
`halo component' and an internally absorbed hot `disk component' which is
dominating the emission in the hard (0.5-2.0 keV) ROSAT energy range. The
combination of X-ray and radio polarization observations allows an estimate of
the plasma parameter beta = U_therm/U_magn which is found to be 0.2+/-0.1. This
result supports the hypothesis that magnetic fields play an important role for
the evolution and structure of galactic gas haloes. The high energy input rate
in the active star-forming disk of M83 seems to be responsible for the outflow
of hot gas and the halo formation.

Physics. This led to the surprising result that galaxy correlations are fractal
and not homogeneous up to the limits of the available catalogs. The usual
statistical methods, which are based on the assumption of homogeneity, are
therefore inconsistent for all the length scales probed so far, and a new, more
general, conceptual framework is necessary to identifythe real physical
properties of these structures. In the last few years the 3-d catalogs have
been significatively improved and we have extended our methods to the analysis
of number counts and angular catalogs. This has led to a complete analysis of
all the available data that we present in this review. The result is that
galaxy structures are highly irregular and self-similar: all the available data
are consistent with each other and show fractal correlations (with dimension $D
\simeq 2$) up to the deepest scales probed so far ($1000 \hmp$) and even more
as indicated from the new interpretation of the number counts. The evidence for
scale-invariance of galaxy clustering is very strong up to $150 \hmp$ due to
the statistical robustness of the data but becomes progressively weaker
(statistically) at larger distances due to the limited data. In These facts
lead to fascinating conceptual implications about our knowledge of the universe

Modified fluctuations of the EM field can also account for the `van der Waals'

fluctuations, the EM vacuum behaves essentially as a complex fluid, and
modifies the motion of objects through it. In particular, from the mechanical
response function of the EM vacuum, we extract a plethora of interesting
results, the most notable being: (i) The effective mass of a plate depends on
its shape, and becomes anisotropic. (ii) There is dissipation and damping of
the motion, again dependent upon shape and direction of motion, due to emission
of photons. (iii) There is a continuous spectrum of resonant cavity modes that
can be excited by the motion of the (neutral) boundaries.

  (University of Chicago)","Variational problems for Riemannian functionals and arithmetic groups",,,,"FI-ST1997-012","math.DG",,"  In this paper we introduce a new approach to variational problems on the
space Riem(M^n) of Riemannian structures (i.e. isometry classes of Riemannan
metrics) on any fixed compact manifold M^n of dimension n >= 5. This approach
often enables one to replace the considered variational problem on Riem(M^n)
(or on some subset of Riem(M^n)) by the same problem but on spaces Riem(N^n)
for every manifold N^n from a class of compact manifolds of the same dimension
and with the same homology as M^n but with the following two useful properties:
(1) If \nu is any Riemannian structure on any manifold N^n from this class such
that Ric_(N^n,\nu) >= -(n-1), then the volume of (N^n,\nu) is greater than one;
and (2) Manifolds from this class do not admit Riemannian metrics of
non-negative scalar curvature.
  As a first application we prove a theorem which can be informally explained
as follows: Let M be any compact connected smooth manifold of dimension greater
than four, M et(M) be the space of isometry classes of compact metric spaces
homeomorphic to M endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff topology, Riem_1(M) in M
et(M ) be the space of Riemannian structures on M such that the absolute values
of sectional curvature do not exceed one, and R_1(M) denote the closure of
Riem_1(M) in M et(M ). Then diameter regarded as a functional on R_1(M) has
infinitely many ""very deep"" local minima.

are measured with respect to an estimated reaction plane which, because of
finite multiplicity fluctuations, differs in general from the true reaction
plane. It follows that the measured distributions do not coincide with the true
ones. I propose a general method of reconstructing the Fourier coefficients of
the true azimuthal distributions from the measured ones. This analysis suggests
that the Fourier coefficients are the best observables to characterize
azimuthal anisotropies because, unlike other observables such as the in-plane
anisotropy ratio or the squeeze-out ratio, they can be reconstructed
accurately.

electromagnetic current operator in calculations of electronuclear reactions.
In contrast to the traditional scheme, where approximations are made for the
transferred momentum, transferred energy and initial momentum of the struck
nucleon in obtaining an on-shell inspired form for the current, we treat the
problem exactly for the transferred energy and transferred momentum. We
calculate response functions for the reaction $^2H(e,e'p)n$ at CEBAF (TJNAF)
energies and find large relativistic corrections. We also show that in Plane
Wave Impulse Approximation, it is always possible to use the full operator, and
we present a comparison of such a limiting case with the results incorporating
relativistic effects to the first order in the initial momentum of the struck
nucleon.
