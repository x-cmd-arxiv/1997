functions on H spanned by the matrix elements of representations from A. The
properties of the system are related to the geometry of a certain algebraic
variety X_A, which belongs to the class of group compactifications studied by
De Concini and Procesi. We develop the theory of Euler integral representations
for these generalized hypergeometric functions (with integrals taken over

expanding the delta-function along a subgroup into a power series and taking
the termwise Fourier transform.

tested the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) method to perform the spectral

all galaxies in an ordered and continuous spectral sequence, which is strongly
correlated with the morphological type. The PCA allows to quantify the
systematic physical properties of the galaxies in the sample, like the
different stellar contributions to the observed light as well as the stellar
formation history. We also examine the influence of the emission lines, and the
signal-to-noise ratio of the data. This analysis shows that the emission lines
play a significant role in the spectral classification, by tracing the activity
and abnormal spectral features of the observed sample. The PCA also provides a
powerful tool to filter the noise which is carried by the ESS spectra. By
comparison of the ESS PCA spectral sequence with that for a selected sample of
Kennicutt galaxies (Kennicutt 1992a), we find that the ESS sample contains 26%
of E/S0, 71% of Sabc and 3% of Sm/Irr. The type fractions for the ESS show no
significant changes in the redshift interval $z \sim 0.1-0.5$, and are
comparable to those found in other galaxy surveys at intermediate redshift. The
PCA can be used independently from any set of synthetic templates, providing a
completely objective and unsupervised method to classify spectra. We compare
the classification of the ESS sample given by the PCA, with a $\chi^2$ test

cosmic rays above about 10 MeV/nucleon has long been considered unlikely due to
energy considerations. In order to circumvent such arguments, the hypothesis
that ``flux trapping'' of extragalactic cosmic rays occurs in the Galactic
confinement volume is advanced in this paper. This hypothesis is based on a
number of speculative assumptions about the properties of Galactic and
intergalactic magnetic fields. The intergalactic cosmic-ray density expected
under conservative assumptions about its extragalactic origins is then shown to
be of the right order of magnitude to account for the locally observed cosmic
radiation. It is demonstrated that an extragalactic scenario of cosmic-ray
origin that is consistent with the observed cosmic-ray energy spectrum and
preserves the successes of Galactic propagation theory can be constructed. The
position of the ``ankle'' in the cosmic-ray energy spectrum follows as a
natural consequence from this explanation. The $\gamma$-ray flux from the
Magellanic clouds is shown to provide no suitable testing ground for the
decision for or against an extragalactical origin in this scenario. It is
argued that recent observational evidence seems to be in favour of a dual
origin of cosmic-rays. The hadronic component is mainly extragalactic while the

primordial power spectrum contains a scale dependent non-Gaussian component
provided by the remnants of the bubbles. We predict the anisotropies in the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) induced by inflationary bubbles. We build a
general analytic model for describing a bubbly perturbation; we evolve each
Fourier mode using the linear theory of perturbations from reheating until
decoupling; we get the CMB anisotropies by considering the bubbly perturbation
intersecting the last scattering surface. The CMB image of an inflationary
bubble is a series of concentric isothermal rings of different color (sign of
$\delta T/T$) on the scale of the sound horizon at decoupling ($\le 1^{o}$ in
the sky); the resulting anisotropy is therefore strongly non-Gaussian. The mean
amplitude of $\delta T/T$ for a bubble of size $L$ follows the known estimates
for linear perturbations, $\delta T/T\simeq\delta\rho /\rho\cdot
(L/H^{-1})^{2}$. In particular, bubbles with size corresponding to the seeds of

the presence of a significant component of thermal X-ray emission (> 60%),
amounting to ~10^{9}Mo of hot ISM. Within 3' from the nucleus of NGC 1316, the
HRI X-ray surface brightness falls as r^{-2}. In the inner ~40"", the X-ray
surface brightness is significantly elongated (e ~ 0.3). This flattened X-ray
feature is confirmed by a straightforward statistics test as well as moment
analysis. By comparing the morphology of the X-ray emission with the
distribution of optical dust patches, we find that the X-ray emission is
significantly reduced at the locations where the dust patches are more
pronounced, indicating that at least some of the X-ray photons are absorbed by
the cold ISM. We also compare the distribution of the hot and cold ISM with
that of the ionized gas, using recently obtained Ha CCD data. We find that the
ionized gas is distributed roughly along the dust patches and follows the large
scale X-ray distribution at r > 1' from the nucleus. However, there is no
one-to-one correspondence between ionized gas and hot gas. Both morphological
relations and kinematics suggest different origins for hot and cold ISM. The
radio jets in projection appear to pass perpendicularly through the central

solution explains the dependence of the age at a given level of elemental
depletion on the stellar effective temperature, nuclear cross sections, and
chemical composition. Most importantly, our results allow observers to
translate lithium non-detections in young cluster members into a
model-independent minimum age for that cluster. Using this procedure, we have
found lower limits to the ages of the Pleiades (100 Myr) and Alpha Persei (60
Myr) clusters. Recent experimental work on the low energy resonance in the
^10B(p,\alpha)^7Be reaction has greatly enhanced estimates of the destruction
rate of ^10B, making it possible for stars with M>0.1 M_sun to deplete both

data we derive the distribution of total mass in NGC 4472. From 0.1r_e to 1r_e
the total mass is identical to the expected stellar mass. Therefore stellar
mass to light ratios can be determined from x-ray observations! Also the widely
used ``mass dropout'' assumption must be incorrect in this important part of
the cooling flow. Recent ROSAT observations indicate gas temperatures in excess
of the virial stellar temperature, totally unlike standard cooling flow models.
However, these new results can be understood if an additional massive component
of ``circumgalactic'' gas is assumed to fill the outer galactic halos beyond
most of the stars. This old hot gas, first heated during the epoch of galaxy
formation, continues to flow into the stellar parts of ellipticals today,
combining with gas expelled from evolving stars. This dual origin of hot

constrain parameters such as the disk geometry and the rotation of the central

modeled with simple assumptions such as local isotropy of emission. Here we
consider line formation in the presence of velocity gradients induced by the
differential flow in the disk. In this case the emission can have anisotropy in
the form of an azimuthal dependence relative to the local principle axes of
shear. Since the physical conditions in a disk are uncertain in detail, we
investigate this effect with simple parameterized models based on Sobolev
theory to highlight the overall character of the changes in the line profile.
We find that velocity gradients generally cause a relative increase of flux in
the red wing, hence the inner radius of the disk would be underestimated if the
effect were not taken into consideration. If the inner radius is used as a
signature of black hole rotation, as when the disk is not emissive within the
marginally stable circular orbit, then the inferred rotation would be
overestimated in cases where the emissivity of the disk has fairly shallow

under which gravothermal oscillations (GTOs) occur. If E_{tot} and E_c are the
energies of the cluster and of the core, respectively, and t_{rh} and t_c are
their relaxation times, then \epsilon \equiv (E_{tot}/t_{rh})/(E_c/t_{rc}) is a
good predictor of GTOs: all models with \epsilon>0.01 are stable, and all but
one with \epsilon < 0.01 oscillate. We derive a scaling law for \epsilon
against N and m_1/m_2 and compared with our numerical results. Clusters with
larger m_2/m_1 or smaller N are stabler.

groups, significantly more than in most previous studies where group samples
were obtained from galaxy data sets of comparable quality to (but smaller
extent than) PPS. Groups are identified with the adaptive Friends-Of-Friends
(FOF) algorithm of Huchra & Geller (1982), with suitable normalizations
D_0=0.231 Mpc/h and V_0=350 km/s at cz_0=1000 km/s. The luminosity function
(LF) normalization \phi_*=0.02 (h/Mpc)^3} appropriate for PPS yields a number
density threshold \delta n/n\approx 180 for the adopted D_0, instead of \delta
n/n\approx 80 used in previous studies of other samples. We discuss how to
self-consistently match FOF parameters among different galaxy samples. We then
separately vary several FOF and sample parameters, and discuss their effect on
group properties. Loose groups in PPS nicely trace the large scale structure
(LSS) in the parent galaxy sample. Group properties vary little with different
redshift corrections, redshift cut-off, and galaxy LF, but are rather sensitive
to the adopted links D_0 and V_0. More precisely, the typical (i.e., median)
group size (velocity dispersion) is linearly related to the adopted distance
(velocity) link, while it is rather insensitive to the adopted velocity
(distance) link. Physical properties of groups in PPS and in directly
comparable samples show good agreement. There is a complex interplay among LSS
features, sample depth, FOF grouping procedure, and group properties.(abridged)

region is discussed based on the analysis of a 9' resolution survey of the
Galactic center region in the J=1->0 line of C^18O. Emphasis is placed on the
comparison with ^12CO(1--0) data. The line shapes of C^18O(1--0) and
^12CO(1--0) differ significantly. The ratio of the intensities of the two
isotopomers in the Galactic center region is generally higher than the value of
~15 expected from the ``Standard Conversion Factor'' (SCF) of ^12CO integrated
line intensity to H_2 column density. In our data, this ratio is in the range
from 30 to 200, mostly ~60 to 80. From LVG calculations, we estimate that the
large scale ^12CO(1--0) emission in the Galactic center region is of moderate
or low optical depth. Higher optical depths are restricted to very limited
regions. We estimate H_2 densities and kinetic temperatures for different
ranges of intensity ratios. A considerable amount of molecular mass is in a
widespread molecular gas component with low densities and high kinetic
temperatures. The total molecular mass is found to be (3^+2_-1) 10^7 M_{sun}.
We show that the SCF is not valid toward the Galactic bulge. It overestimates
the H_2 column density by an order of magnitude because the assumptions
required for this factor are not fulfilled for a significant fraction of the
molecular gas. Therefore, also one cannot apply a modified conversion factor to
the Galactic center region since the N(H_2)/I(^12CO) ratio is highly variable
and cannot be represented by a universal constant. Results from external
galaxies indicate that the ^12CO emission is generally not a suitable tracer of
H_2 masses in galactic bulges.

Andreev reflection on a gapless superconductor. This process affects the

continued to real frequency using the maximum-entropy method, as well as a fit
based on spinwave theory. The numerical results are compared with spinwave
calculations for finite lattices. There is a surprisingly large change in the
exact spectrum going from 4*4 to 6*6 sites. In the former case there is a
single dominant two-magnon peak at frequency w/J appr. 3.0, whereas in the
latter case there are two approximately equal-sized peaks at w/J appr. 2.7 and
3.9. This is in good qualitative agreement with the spinwave calculations
including two-magnon processes on the same lattices. Both the Lanczos and the
QMC results indicate that the actual infinite-size two-magnon profile is
broader than the narrow peak obtained in spinwave theory, but the positions of
the maxima agree to within a few percent. The higher-order contributions
present in the numerical results are merged with the two-magnon profile and

Nonsingular, in contrast with their hedgehog cousins in pure
antiferromagnetism, these texture excitations are what hedgehogs become when
the antiferromagnetic order parameter is permitted to ""escape"" into
superconducting directions. The structure of such excitations is determined in
a simple setting, and a number of their experimental implications are examined.

is presented for pressures up to 30 GPa, temperatures down to 25 mK and
magnetic fields up to 10 T. With the examples of CeCu2Ge2 and CeCu2Si2 we focus
on the interplay of normal phase and superconducting properties. With
increasing pres- sure, the behaviour of CeCu2Ge2 evolves from that of an
antiferromagnetically ordered Kondo system to that characteristic of an
intermediate valence compound as the Kondo temperature increases by about two
orders of magnitude. In the pressure window 8-10 < P < 20 GPa, a
superconducting phase occurs which com- petes at low pressure with magnetic
ordering. For CeCu2Si2 the effective mass of carriers is probed by both the
coefficient of the Fermi liquid law and the ini- tial slope of the upper
critical field. The magnetic instability is studied no- tably for CeRu2Ge2 and
Yb-based compounds for which pressure-induced magnetic ordering tends to
develop. Finally, contrary to conventional wisdom, we argue that in heavy
fermions a large part of the residual resistivity is most likely not
independent of temperature; tentatively ascribed to Kondo hole, it can be very
pressure as well as sample dependent. [electrical resistivity, thermoelectric

local mode is developed whereby the mode is considered classically and phonons,
quantum mechanically. The decay rate of the mode is expressed via the negative
frequency parts of the phonon pair correlation functions. In the case of
two-phonon decay the later satisfy the linear integral equations while in the
case of two- and more-phonon decay they satisfy the nonlinear integral
equations. As a result, the processes mentioned differently depend on the mode
amplitude A: two-phonon processes smoothly deminish if A tends to infinity
while three- and more-phonon processes are fully switched-off at large
amplitudes and they abruptly switch-on if the amplitude approaches the critical
value. At that the decay rate gets rather high value (of the order of the mode
quantum per period). The final stage of the relaxation is well described by the
perturbation theory.

that there are two natural regularization schemes, each of which leads to a
well-defined operator. Both operators can be completely specified by giving
their action on states labelled by graphs. The two final results are closely
related but differ from one another in that one of the operators is sensitive
to the differential structure of graphs at their vertices while the second is
sensitive only to the topological characteristics. (The second operator was
first introduced by Rovelli and Smolin and De Pietri and Rovelli using a
somewhat different framework.) The difference between the two operators can be
attributed directly to the standard quantization ambiguity. Underlying
assumptions and subtleties of regularization procedures are discussed in detail

and the higher helicity components are another two factors which decrease the
perturbative predictions. For the transition form factor
$F_{\eta_c\gamma}(Q^2)$, they bring sizable corrections in the present
experimentally accessible energy region ($Q^2 \leq 10 GeV^2$). For the
transition form factor $F_{\eta_b\gamma}(Q^2)$, the corrections coming from
these two factors are negligible since the $b$-quark mass is much larger than

minimal (Bures) and a maximal one. We examine the proposition that it is
physically meaningful to treat the volume elements of these metrics as
densities-of-states for thermodynamic purposes. In the n = 2 (spin-1/2) case,
use of the maximal monotone metric, in fact, does lead to the adoption of the
Langevin (and not the Brillouin) functions, thus, completely conforming with a
recent probabilistic argument of Lavenda. Brody and Hughston also arrived at
the Langevin function in an analysis based on the Fubini-Study metric. It is a
matter of some interest, however, that in the first (subsequently modified)
version of their paper, they had reported a different result, one fully
consistent with the alternative use of the minimal monotone metric. In this
part I of our investigation, we first study scenarios involving partially

extension of the two-level systems. In part II, we examine, in full generality,
