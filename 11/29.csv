single, rapid burst of star formation at high redshift, and have evolved
quiescently since that time. In opposition to this traditional view is evidence
that at least some elliptical galaxies have formed from the merger of two disk
galaxies. What has not been clear is which process is the dominant formation
mechanism for the large majority of elliptical galaxies. This question has
significant implications for cosmological models, as different models make
different predictions for the formation mechanism and epoch of elliptical
galaxies. Here I use deep optical and near-infrared images to show that there
are fewer galaxies with very red optical and near-infrared colors than
predicted by models in which typical elliptical galaxies have completed their
star formation by z >= 5. These observations require that elliptical galaxies
have significant star formation at z < 5. This requirement, combined with
constraints on lower redshift starbursts from the modest ultraviolet
luminosities of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field and the properties of
galaxies from 0 < z < 1, suggests that elliptical galaxies form at moderate
redshift in dusty starbursts and/or through the hierarchical merging of smaller

Both are low luminosity (Mv ~ -3.5), low mass systems (M ~ 10^3 Msolar). The
chance discovery of these two clusters in two parallel WFPC2 fields suggests a
significant incompleteness in the LMC cluster census near the bar. One of the
clusters is roughly elliptical and compact, with a steep light profile, a
central surface brightness Mu_v(0) 20.2 mag/arcsec2, half-light radius Rhl ~
0.9 pc (total visual major diameter D ~ 3 pc) and an estimated mass M ~ 1500
Msolar. From the colour-magnitude diagram and isochrone fits we estimate its
age as t ~ 2-5 10^8 years. Its mass function has a fitted slope of Gamma =
\Delta log \phi (M) / \Delta log M = -1.8 +/- 0.7 in the range probed (0.9 <
M/Msolar < 4.5). The other cluster is more irregular and sparser, having
shallower density and surface brightness profiles. We obtain Gamma = -1.2 +/-
0.4, and estimate its mass as M ~ 400 Msolar. A derived upper limit for its age
is t < 5 10^8 years. Both clusters have mass functions with slopes similar to
that of R136, a massive LMC cluster, for which HST results indicate Gamma ~
-1.2. They also seem to be relaxed in their cores and well contained in their
tidal radii.

attributes similarities in the rheology of such ``soft glassy materials'' to
the shared features of structural disorder and metastability. By focusing on
the dynamics of mesoscopic elements, it retains a generic character.
Interactions are represented by a mean-field noise temperature x, with a glass
transition occurring at x=1 (in appropriate units). The exact solution of the
model takes the form of a constitutive equation relating stress to strain
history, from which all rheological properties can be derived. For the linear
response, we find that both the storage modulus G' and the loss modulus G''
vary with frequency as \omega^{x-1} for 1<x<2, becoming flat near the glass
transition. In the glass phase, aging of the moduli is predicted. The steady
shear flow curves show power law fluid behavior for x<2, with a nonzero yield
stress in the glass phase; the Cox-Merz rule does not hold in this
non-Newtonian regime. Single and double step strains further probe the
nonlinear behavior of the model, which is not well represented by the BKZ
relation. Finally, we consider measurements of G' and G'' at finite strain
amplitude \gamma. Near the glass transition, G'' exhibits a maximum as \gamma
is increased in a strain sweep. Its value can be strongly overestimated due to
nonlinear effects, which can be present even when the stress response is very
nearly harmonic. The largest strain \gamma_c at which measurements still probe
the linear response is predicted to be roughly frequency-independent.

interact with the string, which enables one to derive the coefficient functions
parametrizing the bilocal correlator of the dual field strength tensors. The
asymptotic behaviours of these functions at small and large distances are
argued to be in a good agreement with the observable lattice data.

off-shell structure of nucleon-nucleon t-matrices, derived from realistic NN
potentials, is investigated within the context of a full-folding model based on
the impulse approximation. Our study uses recently developed NN potential
models, which describe a subset of the NN data base with a $\chi^2$ per datum
$\sim$1, which means that the NN t-matrices are essentially on-shell
equivalent. We calculate proton-nucleus elastic scattering observables for
$^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb between 100 and 200 MeV laboratory energy.
We find that the elastic scattering observables are insensitive to off-shell
differences of the employed NN t-matrices. A more detailed investigation of the
scattering equation and the optical potential as given in a factorized
approximation reveals that the elastic scattering observables do not sample the
NN t-matrices very far off-shell where they exhibit differences.

processes from conducting and insulating targets to the ion are discussed. We
find good agreement with previously published experimental data for the image
