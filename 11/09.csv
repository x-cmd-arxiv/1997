projective line $C$ to the flag variety of $G$. We prove that the global
Intersection Cohomology of $Q$ carries a natural pure Tate Hodge structure, and
compute its generating function. We define an action of the Langlands dual Lie
algebra $g^L$ on this cohomology. We present a new geometric construction of
the universal enveloping algebra $U(n^L_+)$ of the nilpotent subalgebra of
$g^L$. It is realized in the Ext-groups of certain perverse sheaves on
Quasimaps' spaces, and it is equipped with a canonical basis numbered by the
irreducible components of certain algebraic cycles, isomorphic to the
intersections of semiinfinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian of $G$. We
compute the stalks of the IC-sheaves on the Schubert strata closures in $Q$.
They carry a natural pure Tate Hodge structure, and their generating functions
are given by the generic affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. In the Appendix we
prove that Kontsevich's space of stable maps provides a natural resolution of
$Q$.

of hypothesis of galactic origin of Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption systems. Two
basic premises of our discussion are (1) HDF redshift surface densities in the
redshift interval 0<z<6; and (2) validity of low-redshift results on redshift
coincidences, showing average absorption cross-section corresponding to radius
of 160$h^{-1}$ kpc for $L^*$ galaxies. Low-redshift analysis also showed
covering factor nearing unity, which will be used and discussed in further
considerations. Semantic problems concerned with the interpretation of galaxy
absorption cross-section are discussed in some details, and importance of
distinction between size of the absorbers and absorption coherence length is
emphasized. It is shown that HDF data predict huge number of absorption
systems, in fact much larger than observed, which shows frequently quoted
argument that number of galaxies is insufficient to account for all absorption
lines to be wrong. Road to achieving higher compatibility with the empirical
statistics is shown to lie in applying the luminosity scaling, possibly with
cut-off. This is significant for recent attempts to explain the association of
the Ly-$\alpha$ forest systems with normal galaxies.

handling scaling structures and processes. We begin this survey by pointing out
the relevance of the subject to physical situations. Then the essential
definitions and formulae from fractional calculus are summarized and their
immediate use in the study of scaling in physical systems is given. This is
followed by a brief summary of classical results. The main theme of the review
rests on the notion of local fractional derivatives. There is a direct
connection between local fractional differentiability properties and the
dimensions/ local Holder exponents of nowhere differentiable functions. It is
argued that local fractional derivatives provide a powerful tool to analyse the
pointwise behaviour of irregular signals and functions.

Raman scattering from high- and low-energy excitations has been studied in
relation to the hole doping level, temperature, and energy of the incident
photons. For underdoped superconductors, it is concluded that short range
antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations persist with hole doping and doped single
holes are incoherent in the AF environment. Above the superconducting (SC)
transition temperature T_c the system exhibits a sharp Raman resonance of B_1g
symmetry and about 75 meV energy and a pseudogap for electron-hole excitations
below 75 meV, a manifestation of a partially coherent state forming from doped
incoherent quasi-particles. The occupancy of the coherent state increases with
cooling until phase ordering at T_c produces a global SC state.

methods employed by Taubes to solve the anti-self-dual and similar non-linear
elliptic partial differential equations. Indeed, the estimates one can obtain
using these critical-exponent norms appear to be the best possible when one
needs to bound the norm of a Green's operator for a Laplacian, depending on a
connection varying in a non-compact family, in terms of minimal data such as
the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian or the L^2 norm of the curvature
of the connection. Following Taubes, we describe a collection of
critical-exponent Sobolev norms and general Green's operator estimates
depending only on first positive eigenvalues or the L^2 norm of the
connection's curvature. Such estimates are particularly useful in the gluing
construction of solutions to non-linear partial differential equations
depending on a degenerating parameter, such as the approximate, reference
solution in the anti-self-dual or PU(2) monopole equations. We apply them here
to prove an optimal slice theorem for the quotient space of connections. The
result is optimal in the sense that if a point [A] in the quotient space is
known to be just L^2_1-close enough to a reference point [A_0], then the
connection A can be placed in Coulomb gauge relative to the connection A_0,
with all constants depending at most on the first positive eigenvalue of the
covariant Laplacian defined by A_0 and the L^2 norm of the curvature of A_0. In
this paper we shall for simplicity only consider connections over
four-dimensional manifolds, but the methods and results can adapted to
manifolds of arbitrary dimension to prove slice theorems which apply when the
reference connection is allowed to degenerate.

  Pagonis (eds.), 'From Physics to Philosophy: Essays in Honour of Michael
  Redhead', Cambridge University Press",,,,"quant-ph",,"  John Bell once argued that one ought to select, out of the 'observables' of
quantum theory, some subset of 'beables' that can be consistently ascribed
determinate values. Moreover, this subset should be selected so as to guarantee
(among other things) that we can dispense with the orthodox interpretation's
loose talk about 'measurement values': ""...the probability of a beable being a
particular value would be calculated just as was formerly calculated the
probability of observing that value"". Working in the framework of C*-algebras
(in particular, Segal algebras), I propose an algebraic characterization of
those subsets of bounded observables of a quantum system that can have beable
status with respect to any (fixed) state of the system. It turns out that
observables with beable status in a state need not all commute (a possibility
Bell himself does not consider), but they must at least form a certain kind of
'quasicommutative' subalgebra determined by the state. A virtue of the analysis
is that it applies to beables with continuous spectra, usually neglected in
discussions of the no-hidden-variables theorems. In the (very) special case
where the algebra of observables for a system is representable on a
finite-dimensional Hilbert space, I give a complete characterization of the
maximal beable subalgebras determined by any state of the system; the
infinite-dimensional case remains open. These results are discussed in relation
to previous results of a similar nature, to 'no-collapse' interpretations of
quantum mechanics, and to algebraic relativistic quantum field theory.
