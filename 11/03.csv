with respect to a number of natural notions of higher order embeddings of
projective manifolds. This is of importance in the understanding of higher
order embeddings of the special varieties of adjunction theory, which are
usually fibered by special Fano manifolds. An analysis is carried out of the
higher order embeddings of the special varieties of adjunction theory that
arise in the study of the first and second reductions. Special attention is
given to determining the order of the anticanonical embeddings of the three
dimensional Fano manifolds which have been classified by Iskovskih, Mori, and
Mukai and also of the Fano complete intersections in $\pn N$.

  Geometry""",,,,"alg-geom hep-th math.AG",,"  The Gamma-series of Gel'fand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky are adapted so that they
give solutions for certain resonant systems of GKZ hypergeometric differential
equations. For this some complex parameters in the Gamma-series are replaced by
nilpotent elements from a ring $R_{A,T}$. The adapted Gamma-series is a
function $\Psi$ with values in the finite dimensional vector space
$R_{A,T}\otimes C$. Applications of these results in the context of toric
Mirror Symmetry are described. Building on work of Batyrev we show that the
relative cohomology module of a certain hypersurface in a torus is a GKZ
hypergeometric $D$-module which over an appropriate domain is isomorphic to the
trivial $D$-module $R_{A,T}\otimes O_T$, where $O_T$ is the sheaf of
holomorphic functions on this domain. The isomorphism is explicitly given by
adapted Gamma-series. As a result one finds the periods of a holomorphic
differential form of degree $d$ on a $d$-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold,
needed for the B-model side input to Mirror Symmetry. Relating our work with
that of Batyrev and Borisov we interpret the ring $\cR_{\sA,\gT}$ as the
cohomology ring of a toric variety and a certain principal ideal in it as a
subring of the Chow ring of a Calabi-Yau complete intersection. This
interpretation takes place on the A-model side of Mirror Symmetry.

during an encounter, and the percentage of HI in the tails increases with the
merging stage. However, the opposite is true for the molecular gas, which is
observed highly concentrated towards the nuclei of interacting galaxies,
amounting to a significant fraction of the dynamical mass. Statistically, there
appears to be more gas observed in interacting galaxies than in normal,
isolated ones. As N-body simulations show, the gas is driven inwards in the
interaction process by the strong gravity torques, before being consumed
through star formation in the triggered starbursts. We review here all

by the MACHO collaboration (Alcock et al. 1997b) had a very long time scale,
t_0 = 123 days. The EROS collaboration (Palanque-Delabrouille et al. 1997)
discovered a 2.5% brightness variation with a period P = 5.1 days. The OGLE
collaboration (Udalski et al. 1997) established that the variation persists
while the micro-lensing event is over, and the variable star is the one which
has been micro-lensed, not its blend.
  The simplest explanation of the periodic variability is in terms of a binary
star with the orbital period P(orb) = 10.2 days, with its component(s) tidally
distorted. Such objects are known as ellipsoidal variables. The binary nature
should be verified spectroscopically.
  Binary motion of the source introduces a parallactic effect into
micro-lensing light curve, and a few examples are shown. The effect is
relatively strong if the light center and the mass center of a binary are well
separated, i.e. if the binary has a large photometric dipole moment. The
diversity of binary parameters is large, and the corresponding diversity of
photometric effects is also large. The presence or absence of the effect may
constrain the lens mass and its distance from the source.

FWHM and a typical S/N of ~15 per diode, this is one of the first detailed UV
spectra of an object in the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) class. The spectrum
probes the physics and kinematics of the high-ionization and coronal line gas,
and the strength and form of the big blue bump component in the UV. We detect
many emission lines, including Lyman alpha, CIV1549, HeII1640, CIII]1909 and
MgII2798. We also identify a feature at 2647A (in the rest-frame) with
highly-ionized iron [FeXI]2649; a line of the same species ([FeXI]7892) has
also been seen in the optical spectrum. The velocity widths of the UV lines are
relatively narrow (FWHM<2000 km/s) and similar to those of the optical lines,
which suggests that all line emission in REJ1034+396, ie. including that of
high- and low-ionization species and the forbidden lines, may be dominated by
an intermediate-velocity (FWHM~1000 km/s), intermediate-density (log Ne~7.5
cm-3) region of gas. The slope of the UV continuum (alpha~0.9) is soft (ie.
red) relative to quasars and the UV-to-soft X-ray flux ratio is unusually low
implying that the big blue bump component is very weak in the UV. The present
epoch UV to soft X-ray continuum is consistent with earlier data, demonstrating
that this extreme big blue bump component is also very stable, unlike many

the validity of this reduction by comparing numerical spiral wave solutions to
the Oregonator reaction-diffusion equation with the corresponding solutions to
the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation at finite distances from the bifurcation
point. We also compare the solutions at a bifurcation point where the systems
develop spatio-temporal chaos. We show that the complex Ginzburg-Landau

applications to be feasible.

investigated within a light-front constituent quark model in the limit of
infinite heavy-quark mass, adopting a gaussian-like ansatz for the three-quark
wave function. The results obtained for the Isgur-Wise form factors
corresponding both to a spin-0 and a spin-1 light spectator pair are presented.
It is found that the Isgur-Wise functions depend strongly on the baryon
structure, being sharply different in case of diquark-like or collinear-type
configurations in the three-quark system. It is also shown that the
relativistic effects lead to a saturation property of the form factors as a
function of the baryon size. Our results are compared with those of different
models as well as with recent predictions from QCD sum rules and lattice QCD
simulations; the latter ones seem to suggest the dominance of collinear-type
configurations, in which the heavy-quark is sitting close to the center-of-mass
of the light quark pair.

realized in extensions of the standard model containing right-handed neutrinos.
We discuss the generation of a baryon asymmetry by the out-of-equilibrium decay
of heavy Majorana neutrinos in these models, without and with supersymmetry.
All relevant lepton number violating scattering processes which can inhibit the
generation of an asymmetry are taken into account. We assume a similar pattern
of mixings and masses for neutrinos and up-type quarks, as suggested by SO(10)
unification. This implies that B-L is broken at the unification scale
$\Lambda_{GUT}\sim 10^{16}$ GeV, if $m_{\nu_\mu} \sim 3\cdot10^{-3}$ eV, as
preferred by the MSW solution to the solar neutrino deficit. The observed
baryon asymmetry is then obtained without any fine tuning of parameters.

description of nuclear system. Equation of state in mean field theory is
obtained for nuclear matter as well as for $N\ne Z$ systems. Through numerical
