the most likely segmentation of the observation into time intervals during
which the photon arrival rate is perceptibly constant -- i.e. has a fixed

Unlike most, this method does not stipulate time bins -- instead the data
themselves determine a piecewise constant representation. Therefore the
analysis procedure itself does not impose a lower limit to the time scale on
which variability can be detected. Locations, amplitudes, and rise and decay
times of pulses within a time series can be estimated, independent of any
pulse-shape model -- but only if they do not overlap too much, as deconvolution
is not incorporated. The Bayesian Blocks method is demonstrated by analyzing
pulse structure in BATSE $\gamma$-ray data. The MatLab scripts and sample data

correlated to a softening of the 0.6-9 keV spectrum. The spectrum is well
described by a hard power law (Gamma=1.64) absorbed by a column density
slightly larger than the Galactic value, with an iron line at 6.4 keV of EW=400
eV. The simultaneous OSSE data are characterized by a much softer power law
with photon index Gamma=3.0, strongly suggesting the presence of a spectral
break in the hard X/soft gamma-ray band. A joint fit to OSSE and ASCA data
clearly shows an exponential cut-off at about 300 keV, and strong reflection

unambiguously. This, together with the inferred low compactness of this source,
favours thermal or quasi-thermal electron Comptonization in a structured Corona

towards the end of a 3-week pointing by CGRO, in 1996 January-February. The
flare peak represents the highest gamma-ray intensity ever recorded for this
object. During the high state, extremely rapid gamma-ray variability was seen.
Coordinated multifrequency observations were carried out with RXTE, ASCA, ROSAT
and IUE and from many ground-based observatories, covering most accessible
wavelengths. The well-sampled, simultaneous RXTE light curve shows an outburst
of lower amplitude (factor of ~3) well correlated with the gamma-ray flare
without any apparent lag. The optical-UV light curves, which are not well
sampled during the high energy flare, exhibit more modest variations (factor of
~2) and a lower degree of correlation. The flux at millimetric wavelengths was
near an historical maximum during the gamma-ray flare peak, with suggestion of
a correlated decay. We present simultaneous spectral energy distributions of 3C
279 prior to and near to the flare peak. The gamma-rays vary by more than the
square of the observed IR-optical flux change, which poses some problems for
specific blazar emission models. The synchrotron-self Compton model would
require that the largest synchrotron variability occurred in the mostly
unobserved sub-mm/far-infrared region. Alternatively, a large variation in the
external photon field could occur over a time scale of few days. This occurs
naturally in the ``mirror'' model, wherein the flaring region in the jet
photoionizes nearby broad-emission-line clouds, which in turn provide soft
photons that are Comptonized to gamma-ray energies.

degree of mixing, and configuration and intensity of the magnetic field are
discussed. In Type Ia supernovae, a departure in the bolometric light curve
from the full-trapping decline of $^{56}$Co can occur within the two and a half
years after the explosion, depending on the evolutionary path followed by the
WD during the accretion phase. If convection has developed in the WD core
during the presupernova evolution, starting several thousand years before the
explosion, a tangled magnetic field close to the equipartition value should
have grown in the WD. Such an intense magnetic field would confine positrons
where they originate from the $^{56}$Co decays, and preclude a strong departure
from the full-trapping decline, as the supernova expands. This situation is
expected to occur in C+O Chandrasekhar WDs as opposed to edge-lit detonated
sub-Chandrasekhar WDs. If the pre-explosion magnetic field of the WD is less
intense than 10$^{5-8}$G, a lack of confinement of the positrons emitted in the
$^{56}$Co decay and a departure from full-trapping decline would occur. The
time at which it takes place can provide estimates of the original magnetic
field of the WD, its configuration, and also of the mass of the supernova
ejecta. In SN 1991bg, the bolometric light curve suggests absence of a
significant tangled magnetic field (intensity lower than $10^{3}$ G).
Chandrasekhar-mass models do not reproduce the bolometric light curve of this
supernova. For SN 1972E, on the contrary, there is evidence for a tangled
configuration of the magnetic field and its light curve is well reproduced by a
Chandrasekhar WD explosion.

purpose of this letter is to articulate the propagation dynamics of radiative

look for morphological and kinematic diagnostics that may distinguish
hydrodynamic protostellar jets from their magnetically dominated cousins. Our
simulations are axisymmetric (2.5-D). A toroidal B_phi field geometry is used.
Our models have high sonic Mach numbers (Ms approx 10), but lower fast mode
Mach number (Mf approx 5). This is approximately the case for jets formed via
disk-wind or X-wind models - currently the consensus choice for launching and
collimating YSO jets. Time-dependent radiative losses are included via a
coronal cooling curve. Our results demonstrate that the morphology and
propagation characteristics of strongly magnetized radiative jets can differ
significantly from jets with weak fields. In particular the formation of
nose-cones via post-shock hoop stresses leads to narrow bow shocks and enhanced
bow shock speeds. In addition, the hoop stresses produce strong shocks in the
jet beam which constrasts with the relatively unperturbed beam in radiative
hydrodynamic jets. Our simulations show that pinch modes produced by magnetic
tension can strongly effect magnetized protostellar jets.

ultra-luminous galaxies to ISO and literature data of thirty starburst and
active galactic nuclei (AGN), template galaxies. We find that
  1) 70-80% of the ultra-luminous IRAS galaxies in our sample are predominantly
powered by recently formed massive stars. 20-30% are powered by a central AGN.
These conclusions are based on a new infrared 'diagnostic diagram' involving
the ratio of high to low excitation mid-IR emission lines on the one hand, and
on the strength of the 7.7um PAH feature on the other hand.
  2) at least half of the sources probably have simultaneously an active
nucleus and starburst activity in a 1-2 kpc diameter circum-nuclear disk/ring.
  3) the mid-infrared emitting regions are highly obscured. After correction
for these extinctions, we estimate that the star forming regions in ULIRGs have
ages between 10^7 and 10^8 years, similar to but somewhat larger than those
found in lower luminosity starburst galaxies.
  4) in the sample we have studied there is no obvious trend for the AGN
component to dominate in the most compact, and thus most advanced mergers.
Instead, at any given time during the merger evolution, the time dependent
compression of the circum-nuclear interstellar gas, the accretion rate onto the
central black hole and the associated radiation efficiency may determine
whether star formation or AGN activity dominates the luminosity of the system.

the central regions and may not have converged to a unique result. At our
highest resolution we have nearly 3 million particles within the virial radius,
$R_{200}$, and force softening that is $\sim 0.2% R_{200}$. This resolution has
also allowed us to resolve a large part of the overmerging problem - we find
over 1000 surviving dark halos orbiting within a single cluster potential.
These data have given us unprecedented insights into the dynamics and structure
of ``halos within halos'', allowing us for the first time, to compare the
distribution of dark matter with observations of galaxies in clusters.

A weak coupling theory is constituted to study the crossover behavior between
the low-temperature region and the high-temperature region analytically. We
found that coherent part around zero frequency in the optical conductivity
disappears for 0<s<2, where s is an exponent of a spectral function of the
environment. Detailed calculation is performed for ohmic damping (s=1). In this
case, the specific heat shows an unusual $T$-linear behavior at low
temperatures, which indicates that the environment strongly influences the
particle motion, and changes the low-energy states of the dissipative particle.
The optical conductivity \sigma(\omega) takes a non-Drude form even at zero
temperature, and the high-frequency side behaves as \omega^(2K-2), where K is a
dimensionless damping strength. The high frequency side of the optical
conductivity is independent of temperatures, while the low frequency side
depends on the temperature, and behaves as T^(2K-2) at high temperatures. We
also comment on the application of this model to the description of incoherent
motion in correlated electron systems.

sufficiently strong. This interaction mixes the unperturbed shell-model

result, an interaction-induced statistical equilibrium emerges in the system.
This equilibrium is due to the off-diagonal matrix elements of the Hamiltonian.
We show that it can be described by means of temperature introduced through the
canonical-type distribution. However, the interaction between the particles can
lead to prominent deviations of the equilibrium distribution of the occupation
numbers from the Fermi-Dirac shape. Besides that, the off-diagonal part of the
Hamiltonian gives rise to the increase of the effective temperature of the
system (statistical effect of the interaction). For example, this takes place
in the cerium atom which has four valence electrons and which is used in our
work to compare the theory with realistic numerical calculations.

model of three competing modes proposed by Busse and Heikes to which spatial
dependent terms have been added. As long as the angular velocity is different
from zero, there is no known Lyapunov potential for the dynamics of the system.
As a consequence the system follows a non-relaxational dynamics and the
asymptotic state can not be associated with a final equilibrium state. When the
rotation angular velocity is greater than some critical value, the system
undergoes the Kuppers-Lortz instability leading to a time dependent chaotic
dynamics and there is no coarsening beyond this instability. We have focused on
the transient dynamics below this instability, where the dynamics is still
non-relaxational. In this regime the dynamics is governed by a non-relaxational
motion of fronts separating dynamically equivalent homogeneous states. We
classify the families of fronts that occur in the dynamics, and calculate their
shape and velocity. We have found that a scaling description of the coarsening
process is still valid as in the potential case. The growth law is nearly
logarithmic with time for short times and becomes linear after a crossover,
whose width is determined by the strength of the non-potential terms.

quarks arising from photon-gluon fusion gives zero contribution to the
logarithmic integral over the polarization asymmetry $\int {d\nu \over

integral in the Bjorken scaling limit then implies a zero gluon-splitting Born
contribution to the Gourdin-Ellis-Jaffe sum rule for polarized structure
functions from massive sea quarks. The vanishing of the polarization asymmetry
at or near the canonical position predicted by perturbative QCD provides an
important tool for verifying the dominance of the photon-gluon fusion
contribution to charm photoproduction and for validating the effectiveness of
this process as a measure of the gluon polarization $\Delta G(x,Q^2)$ in the
nucleon. The displacement of the asymmetry zero from its canonical position is
sensitive to the virtuality of the gluon in the photon-gluon fusion subprocess,
and it can provide a measure of intrinsic and higher-order sea quark
contributions.

limit. A 4-vector local field, called the primary statistical gauge field, and
a statistical blocking parameter are introduced for a consistent treatment of
the problem. The effects of random fluctuations of the fields on local
observables are discussed. It is found that quasiparticle contributions are not
sufficient to saturate local observables. The property of the primary

are predicted to occur well inside the nucleus, where the probability density
can reach values much higher than that of the incident wave. This focusing is
shown to be correlated with the presence at back angles of a strong enhancement
in the elastic cross section, the so-called ALAS (anomalous large angle
scattering) phenomenon; this is substantiated by calculations of the quantum
probability flux and of classical trajectories. To clarify this mechanism, we
decompose the scattering wave function and the associated probability flux into
their barrier and internal wave contributions within a fully quantal
calculation. Finally, a calculation of the divergence of the quantum flux shows
that when absorption is incomplete, the focal region gives a sizeable
contribution to nonelastic processes.

real probability ensemble (not a pseudoensemble) of solutions of the
unquantized Maxwell equation.
  The local realist analysis of light-detection events in spatially separated
detectors requires a theory of detection which goes beyond the currently
fashionable single-mode photon theory. It also requires us to recognize that
there is a payoff between detector efficiency and signal-noise discrimination.
Using such a theory, we have demonstrated that all experimental data, both in
atomic cascades and in parametric down conversions, have a consistent local
realist explanation based on the unquantized Maxwell field.
  Finally we discuss current attempts to demonstrate Schroedinger-cat-like
behaviour of microwave cavities interacting with Rydberg atoms. Here also we
demonstrate that there is no experimental evidence which cannot be described by
the unquantized Maxwell field.
  We conclude that misuse of the Photon Concept has resulted in a mistaken
recognition of ""nonlocal"" phenomena.

proposed a quantum stochastic Schrodinger equation linked to dilations of
quantum dynamical semigroups. Such an equation has found applications in
physics, mainly in quantum optics, but not in its full generality. It has been
used to give, at least approximately, the dynamics of photoemissive sources
such as an atom absorbing and emitting light or matter in an optical cavity,
which exchanges light with the surrounding free space. But in these cases the
possibility of introducing the gauge (or number) process in the dynamical
equation has not been considered. In this paper we show, in the case of the
simplest photoemissive source, namely a two-level atom stimulated by a laser,
how the full Hudson-Parthasarathy equation allows to describe in a consistent
way not only absorption and emission, but also the elastic scattering of the
light by the atom. Morever, we study the differential and total cross sections
for the scattering of laser light by the atom, as a function of the frequency
of the stimulating laser. The resulting line-shape is very interesting. Not
only a Lorentzian shape is permitted, but the full variety of Fano profiles can
be obtained. The dependence of the line shape on the intensity of the
stimulating laser is computed; in particular, the resonance position turns out
to be intensity dependent, a phenomenon known as lamp shift.
