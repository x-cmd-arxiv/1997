prove some basic properties of stringy E-functions and compute them explicitly
for arbitrary Q-Gorenstein toric varieties. Using stringy E-functions, we
propose a general method to define stringy Hodge numbers for projective
algebraic varieties with at worst Gorenstein canonical singularities. This
allows us to formulate the topological mirror duality test for arbitrary

non-Archimedian integrals over spaces of arcs. We need these integrals for the
proof of the main technical statement used in the definition of stringy Hodge

differences between the approaches and also serves to validate the results of
both. STELLA includes implicit hydrodynamics and is able to model supernova
evolution at early times, before the expansion is homologous. STELLA also
employs multi-group photonics and is able to follow the radiation as it
decouples from the matter. EDDINGTON uses a different algorithm for integrating
the transport equation, assumes homologous expansion, and uses a finer
frequency resolution. Good agreement is achieved between the two codes only
when compatible physical assumptions are made about the opacity. A new result
for SN 1993J is a prediction of the continuum spectrum near the shock breakout

accurate knowledge of instrumental noise, MAP data will discriminate among the
cosmogonies considered, and determine the topology of the initial fluctuations.
  A correlation function analysis of the simulated MAP data results in a very
accurate measurement of the acoustic Hubble radius at decoupling. A low-density
open CDM model with Omega_0=0.4 can be distinguished from the Omega_0=1
fiducial CDM model or a Lambda CDM model with > 99% confidence from the
location of the acoustic ""valley"" in the correlation function.
  A genus analysis of the simulated MAP data indicates that in cosmogonies with
Gaussian random-phase initial conditions, a shift of the zero-crossing point of
the genus curve near the mean temperature threshold level nu=0 should not
exceed |Delta nu| = 0.01 (0.04) when the total effective FWHM smoothing is 0.3
deg (1.0 deg). The asymmetry of the genus curve at the positive and negative
threshold levels should not exceed |Delta g/g(nu=1,-1)| = 0.8% (4%) at 0.3 deg
(1.0 deg) FWHM smoothing. Deviations of the observed MAP data in excess of
these small values will be evidence for non-Gaussian behavior.
  The amplitude of the genus curve is a measure of the shape of the power
spectrum at the smoothing scale. Even with the expected amount of instrumental
noise and partial sky coverage (due to the Galaxy), the MAP data should allow
discrimination amongst the cosmogonies considered at more than 99% confidence
solely from a genus amplitude analysis.

examine the NeVIII emission-line properties using new HST-FOS spectra of four
sources, mean spectra derived from two QSO samples in the HST archives, and new

NeVIIIlines are common in QSOs, with an average flux of ~42% of OVI 1034 and
velocity widths that are ~2 to 5 times larger than OVI, CIV 1549 and other
broad lines in the same spectra. The strongest and most reliably measured
NeVIII 774 lines (in two sources) have FWHM ~ 14,500 km/s. Line profile fits in
these cases show that the unusually large widths might be caused by blending
with emission from NIV 765 and OIV~\lam 789. However, standard photoionization
calculations indicate that NIV, OIV and all other lines near this wavelength
should be too weak, leaving (very broad) NeVIII as the only viable
identification for the ~774 A feature. (This conclusion might be avoided if
there are large radial velocity dispersions [>~1000 km/s] in the emitting
region and the resonant absorption of continuum photons enhances the flux in
weaker lines.) The calculations also indicate that the NeVIII emitting regions
have ionization parameters in the range 5 > U > 30, total hydrogen column
densities of 10^22 < N_H < 3 x 10^23 cm-2, and an average covering factor of
>30% (for solar abundances and a nominal QSO continuum shape). The NeVIII
emitting region is therefore more extensive, more highly ionized, and has much
higher velocities than the rest of the broad emission line region (BELR). This
highly-ionized BELR component would be a strong X-ray ``warm'' absorber if it

continua (f proportional to nu^(alpha)) in well defined rest-frame wavelength

calculation in a region close to both the Killing-Cauchy horizon and the
folding singularities that such a space-time contains. In the present paper, we
give a suitable approximation procedure to compute this expectation value, in
the conformal coupling case, throughout the causal past of the center of the

the Killing-Cauchy horizon. We start with a null expectation value before the

near the horizon is compatible with our previous result, which means that such
an approximation may be applied to other colliding plane wave space-times. Even

following the evolution of an initial state with a large number of quanta with
a distribution around a momentum |\vec k_0| corresponding to a thin spherical

theory in the large N limit is used as a framework to study the
non-perturbative aspects of the non-equilibrium dynamics including a
resummation of the effects of the medium (the initial particle distribution).
In a theory where the symmetry is spontaneously broken in the absence of the
medium, when the initial number of particles per correlation volume is chosen
to be larger than a critical value the medium effects can restore the symmetry
of the initial state. We show that if one begins with such a symmetry-restored,
non-thermal, initial state, non-perturbative effects automatically induce
spinodal instabilities leading to a dynamical breaking of the symmetry. As a
result there is explosive particle production and a redistribution of the
particles towards low momentum due to the nonlinearity of the dynamics. The
asymptotic behavior displays the onset of Bose condensation of pions and the
equation of state at long times is that of an ultrarelativistic gas although
the momentum distribution is non-thermal.

has to lie, with 68% C.L., between 6.5 ps$^{-1}$ and 15 ps$^{-1}$, and is below
21 ps$^{-1}$ at 95% C.L. If the interest of measuring $\Delta m_s$ is
underlined, the importance of a precise determination of the B meson decay

this parameter from an accurate measurement of $f_D$, the D meson decay
constant, using results from lattice QCD to relate D and B hadrons. A future
Tau-Charm factory could accomplish this task. It is also shown that from the
present measurements, assuming the validity of the Standard Model, an already
accurate value of $sin 2\beta~=~ 0.67 ^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ is obtained. Sofar no
constraint can be obtained on $sin 2\alpha$. The interest of having a direct
measurement of $sin 2\alpha$ and $sin 2\beta$ at B-factories or at other
facilities is reminded. Finally constraints on SUSY parameters, in the

the absence of N=(4,2) matter to cancel the anomaly presumably makes this
theory inconsistent. We discuss the obstruction in defining this theory in D=6,
starting from an N=6 five-dimensional string model in the decompactification

appears in this limit; as a result the N=(4,2) supergravity in D=6 is extended

Kasner epochs is studied in detail. In the Einstein frame an infinite sequence
of chaotic oscillations of the scale factors on approach to the initial
singularity is impossible, as it was in general relativistic Mixmaster
universes in the presence of a massless scalar field.
  A finite sequence of oscillations of the scale factors described by
approximate Kasner metrics is possible, but it always ceases when all expansion
rates become positive. In the string frame the evolution through Kasner epochs
changes to a new form which reflects the duality symmetry of the theory. Again,
we show that chaotic oscillations must end after a finite time. The need for
duality symmetry appears to be incompatible with the presence of chaotic
behaviour as $t \to 0$. We also obtain our results using the Hamiltonian
qualitative cosmological picture for Mixmaster models. We also prove that a

in $^{80}$Zr the low-lying local minimum state coexisting with the prolate
ground state has the $Y_{32}$ tetrahedral deformation.

created in relativistic heavy ion collisions is essential to understand the
measured Bose-Einstein correlations. The recently suggested ``random walk

the measured magnitude and K_\perp-dependence of R_\perp in Pb+Pb collisions
and the increase of R_l with increasing size of the collision system.

simulations of collisions between three- and five-atom silicon clusters, at a
system temperature of 2000K. Much the most likely products are found to be two
'magic' four-atom clusters. We show that previous studies, which focused on the
equilibrium binding energies of clusters of different sizes, are of limited
relevance, and introduce a new effective binding energy which incorporates the
highly anharmonic dynamics of the clusters. The inclusion of dynamics enhances
the magic nature of both Si4 and Si6 and destroys that of Si7.

considering a one-dimensional system of $N$ non-interacting distinguishable
particles in a infinitely deep square potential well. We find a class of pure
states of the system for which the off-diagonal elements of the matrix above go
to zero as $N$ increases. This property holds too for the state vectors which
are factorized in the single particle wave functions. In this last case, if the
average energy of each particle is less than a common bound, the diagonal
elements are distributed according to the normal law with a mean square
deviation which becomes smaller and smaller as $N$ increases towards infinity.
Therefore when the state vectors are of the type considered we cannot
experience spatial superpositions of the centre of mass and we may conclude
that position is a preferred basis for the collective variable.

vicious circle relative to the von Neumann chain. For the basis of the theory,
the local measurement theorem provides the joint probability distribution for
the outcomes of local successive measurements on a noninteracting entangled
system without assuming the projection postulate, and the quantum Bayes
principle enables us to determine operationally the quantum state from a given
information on the outcome of measurement.
