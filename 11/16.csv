$^{13}$CN Violet and Red System in the spectrum of the post-AGB star HD~56126.
From a synthetic spectrum analysis, we derive a Doppler broadening parameter of
$b=0.51\pm0.04$ km~s$^{-1}$, $^{12}$CN/$^{13}$CN$=38\pm2$, and a lower limit of
$2000$ on $^{12}$CN/$^{14}$CN and $^{12}$C$^{14}$N/$^{12}$C$^{15}$N. A simple
chemical model has been computed of the circumstellar shell surrounding
HD~56126 that takes into account the gas-phase ion-molecule reaction between CN
and C$^{+}$. From this we infer that this reaction leads to isotopic
fractionation of CN. Taking into account the isotopic exchange reaction and the
observed $^{12}$CN/$^{13}$CN we find $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$\sim 67$ (for $T_{\rm
kin}=25$ K). Our analysis suggests that $^{12}$CN has a somewhat higher
rotational temperature than $^{13}$CN: $T_{\rm rot}=11.5\pm0.6$ and $8.0\pm0.6$
K respectively. We identify possible causes for this difference in excitation
temperature, among which the $N''$ dependence of the isotopic exchange
reaction.

includes parameters for the radial scale length and scale height of the H II,
but we allow the H II disk to warp and flare. Our model also includes the
Perseus arm. We use a likelihood analysis on 11 extragalactic sources and 7
pulsars. Scattering in the Perseus arm is no more than 60% of the level
contributed by spiral arms in the inner Galaxy, equivalent to a 1 GHz
scattering diameter of 1.5 mas. Our analysis favors an unwarped, nonflaring
disk with a 1 kpc scale height, though this may reflect the non-uniform and
coarse coverage provided by the available data. The lack of a warp indicates
that VLBI observations near 1 GHz with an orbiting station having baseline
lengths of a few Earth diameters will not be affected by interstellar
scattering at Galactic latitudes |b| ~ 15 degrees. The radial scale length is
15--20 kpc, but the data cannot distinguish between a gradual decrease in the
electron density and a truncated distribution. We favor a truncated one,
because we associate the scattering with massive star formation, which is also
truncated near 20 kpc. The distribution of electron density turbulence
decreases more rapidly with Galactocentric distance than does the hydrogen
distribution. Alternate ionizing and turbulent agents---the intergalactic
ionizing flux and satellite galaxies passing through the disk---do not
contribute significantly to scattering. We cannot exclude the possibility that
a largely ionized, but quiescent disk extends to >~ 100 kpc, similar to that
for some Ly-alpha absorbers.

nine of the sources are compact and suitable for an angular broadening

not extend to large Galactocentric distances (R >~ 100 kpc). A companion paper

Gaussian superposition of WKB solutions are constructed. Contrarily to what is
usually expected, these states are sharply peaked around the classical
trajectories only for small values of the scale factor. This behaviour is
confirmed in the framework of the causal interpretation: the Bohmian
trajectories of many quantum states are classical for small values of the scale
factor but present quantum behaviour when the scale factor becomes large. A
consequence of this fact is that these states present an initial singularity.
However, there are some particular superpositions of these wave functions which
have Bohmian trajectories without singularities. There are also singular
Bohmian trajectories with a short period of inflation which grow forever. We
could not find any non-singular trajectory which grows to the size of our

internal groups, an SU(5) gauge group, and an anomalous U(1) symmetry. These
properties reproduce the standard model with a stable proton, a natural place
for CP violation and doublet-triplet splitting. The equation of motion for the
unified theory is derived and leads to a Higgs field. The thermodynamic
properties of Q are discussed and yield a consistent amplitude for the cosmic
microwave background fluctuations. The manifold Q possesses internal energy
scales which are independent of the field theory defined on it, but which
constrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories. In particular the
electron and its neutrino are identified as ground states and their masses are
predicted. The correct masses of quarks and the CKM mixing angles can be
derived as well from these energy scales if one uses the anomalous U(1)
symmetry. Furthermore, it is shown that if the Planck scale topology of the
universe involves loops as fundamental objects, its spatial dimension is equal
to three. The existence of the prime manifold T^3=S^1 x S^1 S^1 is then
required for a dynamical universe, i.e. a universe which supports forces. Some
