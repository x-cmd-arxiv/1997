cooling. The effect of a background UV radiation field, and the effect of metal
enrichment of halo gas due to star formation and stellar evolution, are
investigated. A background radiation field is found to strongly suppress the
formation of galaxies with circular velocities less than approximately 50 km/s.
The effect is, however, not large enough to reconcile hierarchical clustering
models with observations. Metal enrichment of the halo gas increases the
cooling rate at low redshifts. We find that the mass fraction of gas at virial
temperatures may be reduced by a factor of two, in simulations with a UV
background field added. The decrease in overall efficiency of gas cooling due
to the inclusion of a UV background field can be more than compensated for by
the increased cooling that follows metal enrichment of halo gas, but the effect
may depend strongly on the assumed model of metal enrichment.

  mystery of the missing blue gap solved ?","22 pages LaTeX, 17 postscript figures, submitted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we present new models of massive stars based on recent
advancements in the theory of diffusive mixing and a new empirical formulation
of the mass-loss rates of red supergiant stars. We compute two sets of stellar
models of massive stars with initial chemical composition [Z=0.008, Y=0.25] and
[Z=0.020, Y=0.28]. Mass loss by stellar wind is also taken into account
according to the empirical relationship by de Jager et al. (1988). Despite the
new mixing prescription, these models share the same problems of older models
in literature as far as the interpretation of the observational distribution of
stars across the HRD is concerned. Examining possible causes of the failure, we
find that the adopted rate of mass loss for the red supergiant stages
under-estimates the observational values by a large factor. Revising the whole
problem, first we adopt the recent formulation by Feast (1991), and secondly we
take also into account the possibility that the dust to gas ratio varies with
the stellar luminosity. Stellar models are then calculated with the new
prescription for the mass-loss rates. The models now possess very extended
loops in the HRD and are able to match the distribution of stars across the HRD
from the earliest to the latest spectral types both in the Milky Way, LMC and
SMC. Finally, because the surface H-abundance is close to the limit adopted to
start the Wolf-Rayet phase (WNL type), we suggest that a new channel is
possible for the formation of low luminosity WNL stars, i.e. by progenitors
whose mass can be as low as 20 \msol, that have evolved horizontally across the
HRD following the blue-red-blue scheme and suffering large mass loss during the
red supergiant stages.

affected by general relativity and stellar magnetic fields. Even for field
strengths sufficiently small so that there is no well-defined magnetosphere
surrounding the neutron star, there is still a region in the disk where
magnetic field stress plays an important dynamical role. We construct magnetic
slim disk models appropriate for neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries
(LMXBs) which incorporate both effects (GR and magnetic fields). The
B-field--disk interaction is treated in a phenomenological manner, allowing for
both closed and open field configurations. We show that even for surface
magnetic fields as weak as $10^7-10^8$ G, the sonic point of the accretion flow
can be significantly modified from the pure GR value (near $6M$). We derive an
approximate analytical expression for the sonic radius and show that it mainly
depends on the surface field strength $B_0$ and mass accretion rate $\dot M$
through the ratio $b^2\propto B_0^2/\dot M$. The sonic radius thus obtained
approaches the usual Alfven radius for high $b^2$, and asymptotes to $6M$ as
$b^2\to 0$. We therefore suggest that for neutron stars in LMXBs, the
distinction between the disk sonic radius and the magnetospheric radius may not
exist. We apply our theoretical results to the kHz QPOs observed in the X-ray
fluxes of LMXBs. If these QPOs are associated with the orbital frequency at the
inner radius of the disk, then the QPO frequencies and their correlation with
mass accretion rate can provide useful constraints on the nature of the
magnetic field -- disk interactions as well as on the structure of magnetic
fields in LMXBs. Current observational data may suggest that the magnetic
fields in LMXBs have complex topology.

turnoff. We cannot detect any strongly significant differences in the stellar
populations of the three fields based on the morphologies of the
color-magnitude diagrams, the luminosity functions, and the relative numbers of
stars in different evolutionary stages. Our observations therefore suggest
similar star formation histories in these regions, although some variations are
certainly allowed. The fields are located in two regions of the LMC: one is in
the north-east field and two are located in the north-west. Under the
assumption of a common star formation history, we combine the three fields with
ground-based data at the same location as one of the fields to improve
statistics for the brightest stars. We compare this stellar population with
those predicted from several simple star formation histories suggested in the
literature, using a combination of the R-method of Bertelli et al (1992) and
comparisons with the observed luminosity function. The only model which we
consider that is not rejected by the observations is one in which the star
formation rate is roughly constant for most of the LMC's history and then
increases by a factor of three about 2 Gyr ago. Such a model has roughly equal
numbers of stars older and younger than 4 Gyr, and thus is not dominated by
young stars. This star formation history, combined with a closed box chemical
evolution model, is consistent with observations that the metallicity of the

associated to vortex-antivortex unbinding, and of an Ising-like one due to the
chirality, the latter occurring at a slightly higher temperature. Data for
internal energy, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, correlation length,
and some properties associated with the chirality are reported in a broad
temperature range, for lattice sizes ranging from 24x24 to 120x120; four values
of the easy-plane anisotropy are considered. Moving from the strongest towards
the weakest anisotropy (1%) the thermodynamic quantities tend to the isotropic
model behaviour, and the two transition temperatures decrease by about 25% and
22%, respectively.

were analyzed by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and density functional

packed rows on an otherwise unreconstructed surface, i.e. the O atoms are
attached to two atoms in the first Ru layer Ru(1) and to one Ru atom in the
second layer Ru(2), forming zigzag chains along the troughs. While in the
low-coverage c(2 times 4)-O phase, the bond lengths of O to Ru(1) and Ru(2) are
2.08 A and 2.03 A, respectively, corresponding bond lengths in the
high-coverage (2 times 1)-2O phase are 2.01 A and 2.04 A (LEED). Although the
adsorption energy decreases by 220 meV with O coverage (DFT calculations), we
observe experimentally a shortening of the Ru(1)-O bond length with O coverage.

corresponding nuclear matrix elements are evaluated within the renormalized
quasiparticle random phase approximation with proton-neutron pairing, which
includes the Pauli effect of fermion pairs and does not collapse for a physical
value of the nuclear force strength. It is argued that the pion-exchange mode
of neutrinoless double beta decay dominates over the conventional two-nucleon
mode in the case of the SUSY mechanism. As a result sensitivity of neutrinoless
double beta decay to the SUSY contribution turns out to be significantly better
that previously expected from the two-nucleon mode calculations. An upper limit
on the R-parity violating coupling $\lambda'_{111}$ is derived from
non-observation of neutrinoless double beta decay. This limit is much stronger

anomalies one should not use the propagator widely used in string theory but
rather the one obtained by generalization from quantum mechanics, but (ii) for
chiral anomalies both propagators give the same result. As a check of this
claim in a simpler model we compute trace anomalies in quantum mechanics. The
propagator with a center-of-mass zero mode indeed does not give the correct

We show that all
correlation functions of the model with axially symmetric potentials can be
expressed in terms of holomorphic functions of one variable. This observation
is used to demonstrate the exact solvability of the model. The two-point
correlation function is calculated in the scaling limit by solving the BBGKY
chain of equations. The answer is shown to be universal (i.e. potential
independent up to a change of the scale). We then develop a two-dimensional
free fermion formalism and construct a family of completely integrable
hierarchies (which we call the extended-KP(N) hierarchies) of non-linear
differential equations. The well-known KP hierarchy is a lower-dimensional
reduction of this family. The extended-KP(1) hierarchy contains the
(2+1)-dimensional Burgers equations. The partition function of the N*N NMM is
the tau function of the extended-KP(N) hierarchy invariant with respect to a
subalgebra of an algebra of all infinitesimal diffeomorphisms of the plane.

used to generate the whole spectrum of the solutions. The corresponding
spacetime structures, written in terms of the string metric, are analyzed in
detail. In particular, we show that only the elementary solutions present naked
singularities. The bound states have either null singularities (electric
solutions) or are regular (magnetic or dyonic solutions) with near-horizon
geometries given by the product of two 2d spaces of constant curvature. The
behavior of some of these solutions as supersymmetric attractors is discussed.
We also show that our approach is very useful to understand some of the
puzzling features of charged black hole solutions in string theory.
