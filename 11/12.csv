flow is realized. The mass flux due to the cooling flow increases with time, as
the Compton cooled region expands. However, the mass flux of the Compton
cooling flow is not large, less than 1 M_sun/yr in our model, since Compton
cooled region is limited in an inner galactic region around a quasar. Even
though the quasar active phase ceased, the cooling flow will continue for at

dwarf variables to measure are the oldest of the pulsators, the cool DAVs,
which have not previously been explored through asteroseismology due to their

can be generalized to include nonlinear cluster reconstruction and photometric

Ubiquitous tidal interactions in these dense groups would predict enhanced
activities among the HCG galaxies compared to isolated galaxies. Instead their
CO and FIR properties are surprisingly similar to isolated spirals. The CO data
for 80 HCG galaxies presented here indicate that the spirals globally show the
same H2 content as the isolated comparison sample, although 20% are deficient
in CO emission. The CO deficiency appears linked with the group evolution, and
gas exhaustion through past star formation and removal of external gas reserve
by tidal stripping of the outer HI disk offer a possible explanation. The IRAS
data for the entire sample of 161 HCG galaxies were re-analyzed using
ADDSCAN/SCANPI, improving the sensitivity by a factor of 3-5 over the existing
Point Source Catalog (PSC) and better resolving the contribution from
individual galaxies. We find that FIR emission in HCG galaxies is similar to
isolated, Virgo cluster, and weakly interacting galaxies. A factor two
enhancement in the 25 micr/100 micr flux ratio among the HCG spirals is found,
which suggests intense, localized nuclear starburst activity similar to HII
galaxies. A number of early-type galaxies in HCGs are detected in CO and FIR,
lending further support to the idea that tidal interactions and tidally induced
evolution of the groups and member galaxies are important in our sample.

of the fluids being collision-less. The hydrodynamical evolution is solved
through the SPH method while gravitational forces are calculated using a tree
method. The code is Lagrangian, and fully adaptive both in space and time. A
significant fraction gas in simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation ends
up in tight clumps where it is, in terms of computational effort, very
expensive to integrate the SPH equations. Furthermore, this is a computational
waste since these tight gas clumps are typically not gravitationally resolved.
We solve this by merging gas particles in these regions, thereby limiting the
SPH resolution to the gravitational force resolution, and further speeding up
the simulation through the reduction in the number of particles.

new operators has a drastic effect on their coefficients. The thermal average
of all the operators can be related to that of the quark condensate and the
energy density. The sum rules then yield the temperature dependence of the
parameters of the $\rho$-meson, namely its mass and coupling to the vector
current. Our result is that these parameters are practically independent of
temperature at least up to a temperature of 125 MeV.

  A","J.Phys.A31:9095-9104,1998","10.1088/0305-4470/31/45/009",,"quant-ph",,"  We define a metric in the space of quantum states taking the Monge distance
between corresponding Husimi distributions (Q--functions). This quantity
fulfills the axioms of a metric and satisfies the following semiclassical
property: the distance between two coherent states is equal to the Euclidean
distance between corresponding points in the classical phase space. We compute
analytically distances between certain states (coherent, squeezed, Fock and
thermal) and discuss a scheme for numerical computation of Monge distance for
two arbitrary quantum states.

operator is also studied .
  The relation between our Lax operator and the Lax operator given by Krichever
is also obtained.
