strong evidence for an accretion disk near a supermassive black hole as a

only geometrically thin disks, where the gas moves along geodesics in the

on line profiles from finite disk thickness, radial accretion flow and
turbulence. We adopt the Novikov-Thorne solution, and find that within this
framework, turbulent broadening is the most significant effect. The most
prominent changes in the skewed, double-horned line profiles is a substantial
reduction in the maximum flux at both red and blue peaks. We show that at the
present level of signal-to-noise in X-ray spectra, proper treatment of the

of higher order correlations is based on measuring the distribution of counts
in cells, this work presents an advanced way of measuring it with unprecedented

sources of theoretical errors in extracting counts in cells from galaxy

fact that conventional methods use a finite number of sampling cells to
estimate counts in cells. This effect can be circumvented by using an infinite
number of cells. This paper presents an algorithm, which, in practice achieves
this goal, i.e. it is equivalent to throwing an infinite number of sampling
cells in finite time. The errors associated with sampling cells are completely
eliminated by this procedure which will be essential for the accurate analysis

normal stellar population of 0.5 solar mass stars should be visible. The other
obvious candidate for the lenses is a population of white dwarfs. But, the

conflict with current population II abundance. Here, we propose a more
conventional, but at the moment more speculative, explanation. Some of the
lenses are stars in the disk of the Milky Way. They lie along the line of sight
to the LMC because of warping and flaring of the Galactic disk. Depending on
its scalelength and ellipticity, the disk's optical depth may lie anywhere
between $0.2 \times 10^{-7}$ and $0.9 \times 10^{-7}$. Together with
contributions from the LMC disk and bar and perhaps even intervening stellar
contaminants, the total optical depth may match the data within the

distorted structure and stellar populations of the outer Milky Way disk than
the composition of the dark halo.

include spectral classification, we estimate the general luminosity function,
expressed as a weighted sum of the type-specific luminosity functions. In the
R-band magnitude range of -23 < M <= -16.5, this function exhibits a broad
shoulder centered near M = -20, and an increasing faint-end slope which
formally converges on an alpha value of about -1.8 in the faint limit. The
Schechter parameterization does not provide a good representation in this case,
a fact which may partly explain the reported discrepancy between the luminosity
functions of the LCRS and other redshift catalogs such as the Century Survey
(Geller et al. 1997). The discrepancy may also arise from environmental effects
such as the density-morphology relationship for which we see strong evidence in
the LCRS galaxies. However, the Schechter parameterization is more effective
for the luminosity functions of the individual spectral types. The data show a
significant, progressive steepening of the faint-end slope, from alpha = +0.5
for early-type objects, to alpha = -1.8 for the extreme late-type galaxies. The
extreme late-type population has a sufficiently high space density that its
contribution to the general luminosity function is expected to dominate fainter
than M = -16. We conclude that an evaluation of type-dependence is essential to
any assessment of the general luminosity function.

suggests that the cluster galaxies in AC114 may possess less extensive and less

luminosity, S0 galaxies are less extended than ellipticals, suggesting a
difference in the efficiency of tidal stripping for different galaxy types.

origin of the parametric resonance we consider a small oscillation of a scale
of the compactification around a today's value of it. To make our arguments
definite and for simplicity we consider two classes of models of the
compactification: those by $S_{d}$ ($d=D-4$) and those by $S_{d_{1}}\times
S_{d_{2}}$ ($d_1\ge d_2$, $d_{1}+d_{2}=D-4$). For these models we show that
parametric resonance can occur for the Kaluza-Klein mode. After that, we give
formulas of a creation rate and a number of created quanta of the Kaluza-Klein
mode due to the parametric resonance, taking into account the first and the
second resonance band. By using the formulas we calculate those quantities for
each model of the compactification. Finally we give conditions for the
parametric resonance to be efficient and discuss cosmological implications.

appropriate also for the low momentum particles. More generally, this scaling
property holds for particles of low transverse and arbitrary longitudinal

Further tests of the perturbatively based picture for soft particle production

Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), while the second one provides an
analysis in a generic low-energy supersymmetric extension of the Standard
Model. The goal of these lectures is twofold: on one hand we present a
qualitative and quantitative discussion of the threat that FCNC and CP
violation represent on supersymmetry model building; on the other hand, we
point out how precious FCNC and CP violation may be in obtaining some signals
of the presence of supersymmetry at low energy in the years that separate us
from the advent of LHC physics. In particular, concerning this latter point, we
emphasize and thoroughly analyze the role of experimental searches for rare B
decays and CP violation in B physics.

interesting phenomena can be observed. For the ^1Sigma_g state we found a

state is shown to develop an additional minimum which has no counterpart in
field-free space. The ^1\Sigma_u state shows a monotonous increase in the
dissociation energy with first increasing and than decreasing internuclear

type-I parametric down conversion, the extension to type-II being
straightforward. We show that entanglement, in the Wigner representation, is
just a correlation that involves both signal and vacuum fluctuations. An
analysis of the detection process opens the way to a complete description of
parametric down conversion in terms of pure Maxwell electromagnetic waves.

algorithms, the sqrt(N) step quantum search algorithm is an immediate
consequence of this framework. It leads to several other search-type
applications - several examples are presented. Also, it leads to quantum
mechanical algorithms for problems not immediately connected with search - two
such algorithms are presented for estimating the mean and median of statistical
distributions. Both algorithms require fewer steps than the fastest possible
classical algorithms; also both are considerably simpler and faster than
existing quantum mechanical algorithms for the respective problems.

frequently changes results compatible with local realism into ones that appear
to demonstrate non-locality. The validity of the procedure depends on the
unproven assumption of the independence of emission events. Other possible
sources of bias include enhancement, imperfect synchronisation, over-reliance
on rotational invariance, and the well-known detection loophole. Investigation
of existing results may be more fruitful than attempts at loophole-free Bell
tests, improving our understanding of light.

"quant-ph/9711045","Castagnoli Giuseppe","Giuseppe Castagnoli, Dalida Monti","A reductionistic approach to quantum computation","1 figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In the reductionistic approach, mechanisms are divided into simpler parts
interconnected in some standard way (e.g. by a mechanical transmission). We
explore the possibility of porting reductionism in quantum operations.
Conceptually, first parts are made independent of each other by assuming that
all ``transmissions'' are removed. The overall state would thus become a
superposition of tensor products of the eigenstates of the independent parts.
Transmissions are restored by projecting off all the tensor products which
violate them. This would be performed by particle statistics; the plausibility
of this scheme is based on the interpretation of particle statistics as
projection. The problem of the satisfiability of a Boolean network is
approached in this way. This form of quantum reductionism appears to be able of
taming the quantum whole without clipping its richness.

cases are the homogeneous Heisenberg subalgebra of $SL(M+1)$ and the principal
Heisenberg subalgebra of ${\hat{sl}}(K+1)$. The explicit example of $M=K=1$ is
discussed in detail and the corresponding soliton solutions and tau-functions
