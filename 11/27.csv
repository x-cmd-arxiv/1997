this paper we present a unifying radiation transfer model that can fit the

MeV) spectral data for the ""hard"" and ""soft"" states of Cyg X-1 using an
emission model where a central Comptonizing corona/cloud is illuminated by the
soft photon emission from a cold disk. We assume that the energy is injected to
the corona by two channels: a non-thermal one that injects energetic electrons
into the coronal region, and a thermal one that heats injected and ambient
electrons once they cool sufficiently to form a Maxwellian distribution, i.e.,
we consider a hybrid thermal/non-thermal model. Using simple scaling laws for
the luminosity of the cold disk, the thermal dissipation/heating rate in the
corona, and the rate of energy injection from a non-thermal source, all as
functions of radius of the corona, we explain the hard-to-soft transition as
the result of a decrease in the size of the corona and the inner radius of the
cold disk by a factor ~ 5. For the case of Cyg X-1, we show that the bolometric
luminosity of the source (mass accretion rate) does not change significantly
during the transition, and thus the transition is probably the result of a disk
instability.

Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, and obtained UV spectra at a
resolution of about 20,000 in the redshifted C IV 1549 region. The intrinsic C
IV absorption in the core of the broad emission line is resolved for the first
time into four distinct kinematic components, which are all blue-shifted
relative to the systemic radial velocity of the host galaxy. Two components are
narrow (20 and 30 km/sec FWHM) and at small radial velocities (-90 and -30
km/sec respectively), and could arise from the interstellar medium or halo of
the host galaxy. The two broad components are centered at radial velocities of
-380 and -150 km/sec, have widths of 130 and 210 km/sec (FWHM) respectively,
and most likely arise in outflowing gas near the active nucleus. The cores of
the broad C IV absorption components are very close to zero intensity,
indicating that the absorption regions are extended enough to completely occult
the broad C IV emitting region (which is ~9 light days in extent). The total
column density of the C IV absorption is substantially larger than that
measured by Kriss et al. (1996a) from contemporaneous HUT spectra, but we agree
with their conclusion that the UV absorption is too strong to arise primarily
from the X-ray warm absorber region. The GHRS observations separated by six
months reveal no appreciable changes in the equivalent widths or radial
velocities of any of the absorption components. At present, we know of two

continuum fluxes were at an historic low level, allowing us to accurately
determine the contribution of the narrow-line region (NLR) to the emission
lines. We have generated multicomponent photoionization models to investigate
the relative strength of the high ionization lines compared to those in Seyfert
2 galaxies, and the weakness of the narrow Mg II 2800 line. We present evidence
for a high ionization component of NLR gas that is very close to the nucleus
(~1 pc). This component must be optically thin to ionizing radiation at the
Lyman edge (tau = 2.5) to avoid producing [O I] and Mg II in a partially
ionized zone. The very high ionization lines (N V, [Ne V], [Fe VII], [Fe X])
are stronger than the predictions of our standard model, and we show that this
may be due to supersolar abundances and/or a ``blue bump'' in the extreme
ultraviolet (although recent observations do not support the latter). An outer
component of NLR gas (at only ~70 pc from the continuum source) is needed to
produce the low ionization lines. We show that the outer component may contain
dust, which further reduces the Mg II flux by depletion and by absorption of
the resonance photons after multiple scatterings. We show that the majority of
the emission in the NLR of NGC 5548 must arise within about ~70 pc from the
nucleus. Thus, the NLR in this Seyfert 1 galaxy is very physically compact,
compared to the typical NLR in Seyfert 2 galaxies.

energy surface (PES) of the dissociative adsorption of H_2 on the sulfur
covered Pd(100) surface. The PES is changed significantly compared to the
dissociation on the clean Pd(100) surface, in particular for hydrogen close to
the S atoms. While the hydrogen dissociation at the clean Pd(100) surface is
non-activated, for the (2x2) sulfur adlayer (coverage Theta_S= 0.25) the
dissociation of H_2 is inhibited by energy barriers. Their heights strongly
depend on the distance between the hydrogen and sulfur atoms leading to a
highly corrugated PES. The largest barriers are in the vicinity of the sulfur
atoms due to the strong repulsion between sulfur and hydrogen. Still the
hydrogen dissociation on the (2x2) sulfur covered Pd(100) surface is
exothermic. Thus the poisoning effect of sulfur adatoms for H_2 dissociation at
low sulfur coverage (Theta_S <= 0.25) is mainly governed by the formation of
energy barriers, not by blocking of the adsorption sites. For the c(2x2) sulfur
adlayer (Theta_S= 0.5), the PES for hydrogen dissociation is purely repulsive.
This is due to the fact that for all different possible adsorption geometries
the hydrogen molecules come too close to the sulfur adatoms before the
dissociation is completed.

geometric probabilities. In the case of a frozen heterophase system these

find the temperature behavior of the probabilities which is especially
important near the points of structural phase transitions. The presense of
these structural fluctuations yields a softening of a crystal and a decrease of
the effective Debye temperature. These effects can be directly seen by nuclear
gamma resonance since the occurrence of structural fluctuations is accompanied
by a noticeable sagging of the M\""ossbauer factor at the point of structural

the calculation of two-neutrino double beta decay (TNDBD) matrix elements. We
have shown that within the single-particle approximation of nuclear Hamiltonian
the TNDBD matrix element is equal to zero. The (renormalized) quasiboson
approximation scheme imply for TNDBD transition operator to be a constant, if
one requires the equivalence of initial and final (renormalized) QRPA
Hamiltonians. It means that TNDBD is a higher order process in the boson
expansion of the nuclear Hamiltonian. We have found that the mismatching of
both Hamiltonians is getting worse with increasing strength of particle-
particle interaction especially in the case of QRPA Hamiltonians. It is
supposed to be one of the reasons of the extreme sensitivity of studied matrix
element to the residual interaction appearing in explicit calculations
involving the intermediate nucleus. Further, the Operator Expansion Method
(OEM) has been reconsidered and new transition operators have been rederived in
a consistent way. The validity of the OEM approximation has been discussed in
respect to the other approximation schemes. The OEM combined with QRPA or RQRPA
ground state wave functions reflects sensitively the instabilities incorporated
in the considered ground states. Therefore, the predicting power of the OEM
should be studied with help of other ground state wave functions. e.g. shell
model ones.

(quant-ph/9605034) to a matching bound, thus showing that for any probability
of success Grovers quantum searching algorithm is optimal. E.g. for near
certain success we have to query the oracle pi/4 sqrt{N} times, where N is the
size of the search space. I also show that unfortunately quantum searching
cannot be parallelized better than by assigning different parts of the search
space to independent quantum computers. Earlier results left open the
possibility of a more efficient parallelization.

giving a recursive algorithm for generating explicit expressions for the
infinite number of commuting charges based on a reduction of the W(infinity)
algebra. These charges exist for all spins $s \geq 2$. Likewise, reductions of
the W(infinity/2) and W((1+infinity)/2) algebras yield the commuting quantum
charges for the quantum KdV equation at c=-2 and c=1/2, respectively.

confinement test commonly used to identify integrable discrete systems, but
which nevertheless are non-integrable. As a more sensitive integrability test,
we propose the analysis of the complexity (``algebraic entropy'') of the map
using the growth of the degree of its iterates: integrability is associated
with polynomial growth while the generic growth is exponential for chaotic
systems.
