This failure calls for a critical reevaluation of the theoretical arguments for

to the possible problems for VHE gamma-ray production due to the environmental
conditions a SN progenitor finds itself in. Observational upper limits are
compared with theoretical predictions for the gamma-ray flux. Empirical
arguments from the observation of X-ray power law continua for electron-induced
Inverse Compton gamma-ray emission at TeV energies are discussed in their
relation to the nucleonic Pi-zero decay emission from the same objects.
Finally, a point is made for the simplest case of SNe Ia, expected to explode

detected Southern Hemisphere remnant of SN 1006 is compared with Tycho's SNR.
On the basis of the assumed parameters for the two remnants SN 1006 is
tentatively identified with a remnant whose TeV gamma-ray emission is dominated
by Inverse Compton radiation. Tycho might be dominantly a Pi-zero decay

tests challenging the claims by Pietronero and collaborators that there is no
evidence from available galaxy catalogues that the Universe is actually
homogeneous above a certain scale. In a series of papers, these authors assert
that observations are consistent with a fractal distribution of objects
extending to the limit of the present data. I show that while galaxies are
indeed clustered in a scale-free way on small and intermediate scales, this
behaviour does not continue indefinitely. Although the specific wavelength at
which the galaxy distribution apparently turns to homogeneity is dangerously
close to the size of the largest samples presently available, there are serious
hints suggesting that this turnover is real and that its effects are detected
in the behaviour of statistical estimators. The most recent claims of a
continuing fractal hierarchy up to scales of several hundreds Mpc seem to be
abscribable to the use of incomplete samples or to an improper treatment of
otherwise high- quality data sets. The fractal perspective, nevertheless, can
represent a fruitful way to look at the clustering properties of galaxies, when
properly coupled to the traditional gravitational instability scenario. In the
last part of this paper I therefore try to clarify, at a very simple level,
some of the confusion existing on the actual scaling properties of the galaxy
distribution. In this context, I shall discuss how these can provide hints on
the evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe, when one properly
takes into account the effect of both initial conditions and nonlinear
gravitational growth in producing the presently observed distribution.

the standard picture, beyond this boundary, pulsars with low spin rates cannot
accelerate particles above the stellar surface to high enough energies to
initiated pair cascades through curvature radiation, and the pair creation
needed for radio emission is strongly suppressed. In this paper we postulate
the existence of another pulsar ``death line,'' corresponding to high magnetic
fields $B$ in the upper portion of the $\dot{P}$--$P$ diagram, a domain where
few radio pulsars are observed. The origin of this high $B$ boundary, which
occurs when $B$ becomes comparable to or exceeds $10^{13}$ Gauss, is again due
to the suppression of magnetic pair creation $\gamma\to e^+e^-$, but in this
instance, primarily because of ineffective competition with the exotic QED
process of magnetic photon splitting. This paper describes the origin, shape
and position of the new ``death line,'' above which pulsars are expected to be

interest in connection with the newly discovered planets, some of which are
found to orbit around solar-type stars with a period comparable to that of the
high order g modes of the star. One such example is 51 Pegasi. Here, we
determine the magnitude of the perturbed velocity induced by the tides at the
stellar surface. We show that, in the case of 51 Pegasi, this velocity is too
small to be observed. This result is insensitive to the magnitude of the
stellar turbulent viscosity assumed and is not affected by the possibility of

production at all observed energies. For bursts more than about 30pc away,
internal transparency can be achieved only if the source is moving with a
relativistic bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma\gg 1$, or if the radiation is highly
beamed. Early calculations of $\gamma\gamma\to e^+e^-$ considerations for GRBs
were limited to cases of a beam with opening half-angle $\Thetab\sim 1/\Gamma$,
or expansions of infinitely thin spherical shells. This paper presents our
extension of pair production optical depth calculations in relativistically
expanding sources to more general geometries, including shells of finite
thickness and arbitrary opening angle. The problem is reduced analytically to a
single integral in the broadly applicable case of observing photons along the
axis of the expansion. We find that the minimum bulk Lorentz factor for the
EGRET sources to be optically thin is only moderately dependent on the shell
thickness and virtually independent of its opening solid angle if
$\Thetab\gtrsim 1/\Gamma$. This insensitivity to $\Thetab$ relieves the
commonly-perceived number problem for non-repeating sources at cosmological
distances, i.e. it is not necessary to invoke small $\Thetab$ to effect photon
escape.

zone, the two band Fermi surfaces may cross. We associate the optimal doping
for the highest Tc with this point because only in the vicinity of this
touching point are inter-band Cooper pairs energetically possible. Due to the
lack of time reversal invariance of an inter-band Cooper pair with itself, the
standard interpretation of Josephson tunneling is altered such that the
detailed nature of the single particle tunneling matrix elements contributes to
the supercurrent. The dx2-y2 gap observations from Josephson tunneling are
shown to arise from our model with pairing due to phonons. A Hubbard model is
written down for the two bands at the Fermi energy with realistic parameters

qualitatively explained as due to the character of the two bands in the

<201> for large biaxial compression of Cu, Ag, and Au. The stability of
superlattices is discussed in terms of the coherency strain and interfacial

superlattice formation energies decrease with superlattice period, and the
interfacial energy is positive. Superlattices are formed easiest on (001) and
hardest on (111) substrates. For ordering systems, such as Cu-Au and Ag-Au, the

superlattices along <111> and <001> like in phase-separating systems, while for

results on epitaxial stabilization of disordered Ni-Au and Cu-Ag alloys,

This model uses parameters derived from BLYP calculations on the cluster CuO6.
It explicitly includes the Cu dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals, the O psigma orbitals,

Hubbard model, we find that there is a crossing of two bands in the vicinity of
the Fermi level for the optimally doped superconductor. This crossing
rigorously occurs along the (0,0)-(pi,pi) direction of the 2D Brillouin zone.
The crossing arises due to the overlap of a broad ""B1g"" band dominated by Cu
dx2-y2 character and a narrower ""A1g"" band dominated by Cu dz2 character. We
conclude that optimal doping of LaSrCuO and related materials is achieved when
the Fermi levels coincides with this crossing. At this point, formation of
Cooper pairs between the two bands (i.e. inter-band or IBP) leads to
superconductivity. Furthermore, using geometric considerations, we extend our
conclusions to YBaCuO and offer a simple explanation for the seemingly complex
behavior of Tc as a function of doping in this material. This behavior can be
understood on the basis of multiple band crossings.

perturbative in the coupling and initial amplitude. The non-perturbative
evolution is studied in the large the N limit for the O(N) vector model. A
combination of numerical analysis and the multitime scale analysis reveals the
presence of unstable bands in the nonlinear regime. These are associated with
power law growth of quantum fluctuations, that result in power law relaxation
and dissipation with non-universal and non-perturbative dynamical anomalous
exponents.We find substantial particle production during this non-linear evolu-
tion which is of the same order as that in the linear regime. The expectation
value of the scalar field vanishes asymptotically transferring all of the
initial energy into produced particles via the non-linear resonances in the
unbroken symmetry phase.The effective mass for the quantum modes tends asympto-
tically to a constant plus oscillating O(1/t) terms. This slow decay causes the
power behaviour in the modes which become free for t=infty. We derive a simple
expression for the equation of state for the fluid of produced particles that
interpolates between radiation-type and dust-type equations according to the
initial value of the order parameter for unbroken symmetry. For broken symmetry
the produced particles are massless Goldstone bosons with a radiation-type

have developed a new model using Dirac's approach of Poincare-covariant
many-body dynamics with constraints.
  In our model, the baryon is described as a dynamical set of three valence
quarks and a fourth 'particle', the ""junction"", which carries the momentum
fraction of the sea quarks as well as all of the glue.
  The model's parameters are the quark current masses, and one interaction
strength, determined by the proton radius. Thus the model has no adjustable
free parameters. Nevertheless, we obtain a remarkably good fit to the valence
quark structure functions of the baryon

representations via the formal GNS construction (see q-alg/9607019). The
positive linear functional is integration over $Q$ with respect to some fixed

representation where a Weyl ordering prescription is incorporated. Furthermore
we discuss simple examples like free particle Hamiltonians (defined by a
Riemannian metric on $Q$) and the implementation of certain diffeomorphisms of

reversal maps (involutive anti-symplectic diffeomorphisms of $T^*Q$) to
anti-unitary transformations. We show that the fixed-point set of any
involutive time reversal map is either empty or a Lagrangean submanifold.
Moreover, we compare our approach to concepts using integral formulas of
generalized Moyal-Weyl type. Furthermore we show that the usual WKB expansion
with respect to a projectable Lagrangean submanifold can be formulated by a GNS
construction. Finally we prove that any homogeneous star product on any
