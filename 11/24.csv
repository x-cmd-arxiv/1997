  in Astronomy & Astrophysics, 327, 813",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we continue investigations of the Parker-shearing instability
performing numerical simulations of the magnetic flux tube dynamics in the thin
flux-tube approximation. We show that evolution of flux tubes resulting from
numerical simulations is very similar to that of linear solutions if the
vertical displacements are smaller than the vertical scale height $H$ of the
galactic disc. If the vertical displacements are comparable to $H$, the
vertical growth of perturbations is faster in the nonlinear range than in the
linear one and we observe a rapid inflation of the flux tube at its top, which
leads to a singularity in numerical simulations, if only the cosmic rays are
taken into account. Then we perform simulations for the case of nonuniform
external medium, which show that the dominating wavelength of the Parker
instability is the same as the wavelength of modulations of external medium. As
a consequence of this fact, in the case of dominating cosmic ray pressure, the
dynamo $\alpha$ effect related to these short wavelength modulations is much
more efficient than that related to the linearly most unstable long wavelengths
modes of the Parker instability. Under the influence of differential forces
resulting from differential rotation and the density waves, the $\alpha$-effect
is essentially magnified in the spiral arms and diminished in the interarm
regions, what confirms our previous results obtained in the linear
approximation.

$> 10^{20}$ eV beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cut-off may be due to
neutrinos having acquired a strong interaction at these energies, as suggested
by the Dualized Standard Model. Such a hypothesis is shown to be consistent
with the so far known facts. Further, by linking the astrophysical puzzle of
post-GZK air showers through electric-magnetic duality to the problem of
fermion generations in particle physics, one obtains on the one hand estimates
for the rates of some flavour-changing neutral current decays which are
accessible to experiments being planned, and on the other direct tests on the
hypothesis performable by new air shower detectors such as Auger. The
suggestion does not exclude other explanations for post-GZK showers given in
the literature. However, we diagree with a recent paper by Burdman, Halzen and
Gandhi which sweepingly claimed to have excluded nearly all explanations by new
particle physics including ours.

solving the N-body problem in (2+1)-gravity to the case of Chern-Simons
supergravity. Coupling with supersymmetric point particles is obtained
implicitly by extending the DJH matching conditions of gravity. The consistent
solution of the interacting case is obtained by building a general non-trivial
mapping, extending the superanalytic mapping, between a flat polydromic $X^M$
supercoordinate system and a physical one $x^N$, representing the DJH matching
conditions around the superparticles. We show how to construct such a mapping
in terms of analytic functions, and we give their exact expressions for the two
body case. The extension to the N body case is also discussed. In the
Minkoskian coordinates the superparticles move freely, and in particular the
fermionic coordinates $\Theta(\xi^N_{(i)})$ are constants, whose values can be
fixed by using the monodromy properties. While the bosonic part of the
supergeodesic equations are obtained, as in gravity, by measuring the bosonic
distance in Minkowskian space-time, we find that the fermionic geodesic
equations can be defined only by requiring that a non-perturbative divergence
of the $X^M = X^M(x^N)$ mapping cancels out on the world-lines of the
superparticles.

generators of Clifford algebras with identity element. However, our attempt to
construct even one finite model based on such Clifford-like Yukawa couplings
fails: a Clifford structure of the Yukawa couplings spoils the finiteness of
the gauge couplings, at least for every simple gauge group of rank less than or
