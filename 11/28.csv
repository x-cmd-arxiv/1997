summarize three recent thesis projects at Rutgers University which all suggest
that DM has a low density in the inner parts of bright galaxies, and that most
of the mass therefore resides in the disk. In addition, I present some

massive stars in a wide range of masses (from 6 to 120 Msol) and metallicities
(Z= 0.0004, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02, 0.05). Our calculations are based on the Padova

effects of the initial chemical composition of the star. We finally include
modern results on explosive nucleosynthesis in SNae by Woosley & Weaver 1995.
The issue of the chemical yields of Very Massive Objects (from 120 to 1000
Msol) is also addressed.
  Our grid of stellar yields for massive stars is complementary to the results
by Marigo et al. (1996, 1997) on the evolution and nucleosynthesis of low and
intermediate mass stars, also based on the Padova evolutionary tracks.
Altogether, they represent a complete set of stellar yields of unprecedented
homogeneity and self-consistency.
  Our new stellar yields are inserted in a code for the chemical evolution of
the Galactic disc with infall of primordial gas, according to the formulation
first suggested by Talbot & Arnett (1971, 1973, 1975) and Chiosi (1980). As a
first application, the code is used to develop a model of the chemical
evolution of the Solar Vicinity, with a detailed comparison to the available

galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field is detected at the 99.3% confidence level. An
important element of our analysis is the use of photometric redshifts to
determine distances of lens and source galaxies and rest-frame B-band
luminosities of the lens galaxies. The lens galaxy halos obey a Tully-Fisher
relation between halo circular velocity and luminosity; the typical lens
galaxy, at a redshift z = 0.6, has a circular velocity of 210 +/-40 km/s at M_B
= -18.5, if q_0 = 0.5. Control tests, in which lens and source positions and
source ellipticities are randomized, confirm the significance level of the
detection quoted above. Furthermore, a marginal signal is also detected from an
independent, fainter sample of source galaxies without photometric redshifts.
Potential systematic effects, such as contamination by aligned satellite
galaxies, the distortion of source shapes by the light of the foreground
galaxies, PSF anisotropies, and contributions from mass distributed on the
scale of galaxy groups are shown to be negligible. A comparison of our result
with the local Tully-Fisher relation indicates that intermediate-redshift
galaxies are fainter than local spirals by 1.0 +/- 0.6 B mag at a fixed
circular velocity. This is consistent with some spectroscopic studies of the
rotation curves of intermediate-redshift galaxies. This result suggests that
the strong increase in the global luminosity density with redshift is dominated
by evolution in the galaxy number density.

dynamics of self-gravitating fluid within the framework of the post-Newtonian
approximation in general relativity, using the (3+1) formalism. Our formulation
coincides with Newtonian Lagrangian perturbation theory developed by Buchert
for the scale much smaller than the horizon scale, and with the gauge invariant
linearized theory in the longitudinal gauge conditions for the linear regime.
These are achieved by using the gauge invariant quantities at the initial time
when the linearized theory is valid enough. The post-Newtonian corrections in
the solution of the trajectory field of fluid elements are calculated in the
explicit forms. Thus our formulation allows us to investigate the evolution of
the large-scale fluctuations involving relativistic corrections from the early
regime such as the decoupling time of matter and radiation until today. As a
result, we are able to show that naive Newtonian cosmology to the structure
formation will be a good approximation even for the perturbations with scales
not only inside but also beyond the present horizon scale in the longitudinal
coordinates. Although the post-Newtonian corrections are small, it is shown
that they have a growing transverse mode which is not present in Newtonian
theory as well as in the gauge invariant linearized theory. Such post-Newtonian
order effects might produce characteristic appearances of the large-scale
structure formation, for example, through the observation of anisotropies of
the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Furthermore since our approach
has a straightforward Newtonian limit, it will be also convenient for numerical
implementation based on the presently available Newtonian simulation. ......

  Families of differentially rotating models of a given baryon mass are

profile within a rotating protoneutron star. Maximum angular momentum, which
can be accommodated by a protoneutron star is calculated, for various thermal
conditions in stellar interior, for a baryon mass of $1.5 M_\odot$. In the case
of a thermally homogeneous (isentropic or isothermal) neutrino-opaque interior
this maximum angular momentum turns out to be somewhat higher than that of a
cold neutron star of the same baryon mass, rotating uniformly at the mass
shedding angular velocity. However, if the protoneutron star has a thermal
structure characteristic of initial state, with a low entropy (unshocked) core,
and a high entropy (shocked) outer half of baryon mass, the maximum angular
momentum is significantly lower. This leads to a minimum period of uniform
rotation of cold neutron stars of baryon mass $\sim 1.5~M_\odot$, formed
directly (i.e. without a subsequent significant accretion of mass) from
protoneutron stars with shocked envelope, of about 1.7 ms and strengthens the

eccentricities 0.46 <= e <= 0.96 in a Galactic dark halo resembling our Milky
Way. For the simulations, a particle-mesh code with nested sub-grids and a
direct-summation N-body code running with the special purpose hardware device

velocity distribution, and has a mass of 10^7 solar masses. Simulations with
1.3x10^5 up to 2x10^6 satellite particles are performed. The calculations
proceed for many orbital periods until well after the satellite disrupts.
  In all cases the dynamical evolution converges to a remnant that contains
roughly 1% of the initial satellite mass. The stable remnant results from
severe tidal shaping of the initial satellite. To an observer from Earth these
remnants look strikingly similar to the Galactic dwarf spheroidal satellite
galaxies. Their apparent mass-to-light ratios are very large despite the fact
that they contain no dark matter.
  These computations show that a remnant without dark matter displays larger
line-of-sight velocity dispersions, sigma, for more eccentric orbits, which is
a result of projection onto the observational plane. Assuming they are not dark
matter dominated, it follows that the Galactic dSph satellites with sigma >

``SS443-like sources''-- superaccreting black holes. We used two values of the

1 (``flat spectrum''). The calculations were made for the folowing values of
the upper limit of the mass function: 120 and 30 $M_{\odot}$. For the ``flat

where $J$'s are the coupling constants. This leads to a ``diffusive'' spread of
a local excitation characterized by the constants $D_\mu \propto J_\mu
^2/\omega_\phi .$ Thus, a strongly asymmetric interaction (e.g.
$J_y/J_{x(z)}\gg 1$), would hinder diffusion in the perpendicular directions
($D_{x(z)}\to 0$) manifesting the QZE. We show that this effect is present in
numerical solutions of simple 2-d systems. This reduction in the diffusion
kinetics was experimentally observed in paramagnetic compounds where the
asymmetry of the interaction network manifests through an exchange narrowed
linewidth$.$ New experimental designs are proposed.

typically of the order of 1000, whilst the B-ball can have an arbitrarily large

Affleck-Dine condensate, is likely to be greater that 10^14. The B-balls
typically decay at temperatures less than that of the electroweak phase
transition, leading to a novel version of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, in which
the B asymmetry comes from Q-ball decay rather than condensate decay. This

theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane
decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the
near horizon geometry for large $N$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near
horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in
the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't
Hooft limit of 4-d ${\cal N} =4$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is
shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. We conjecture that

semiclassical expansion of dipole matrix elements, we show that in the
classical limit the master equation reduces to the Zwanzig energy diffusion
equation. The leading quantum corrections are determined and discussed for the
harmonic and Morse potentials.

constant and colour dependent. The constant systems are used mainly for
construction of special Hopf algebra while the colour or spectral dependent for
construction of quantum integrable models. Examples of both types together with
their particular solutions are presented. The complete solution is known only
for the constant system related to the quantized braided groups in the
dimension two. The strategy for solution of the system related to quantum
doubles is suggested and partial results are presented.

single atom spontaneous emission in a linear chain of two-level atoms. The
electromagnetic field is thereby treated with the help of integro-differential
equations which take into account the interaction with the other atoms in the
chain. The life time of the excited atom, the frequency shift of the atomic
transition and the angular distribution of emitted photons are worked out. They
depend on the position of the emitting atom. As compared with the single atom
in free space, considerable modifications occur for atoms a few interatomic
distances away from the ends of the chain.

at a given instant of time is one of the eigenstates of the reduced density
matrix calculated from the wave function of the system plus its environment.
This implies that the above quantum state is a member of a special orthonormed
set of states. Using a suitable Monte-Carlo simulation, this property is shown
to be consistent with the extremely small standard deviation for the
coordinates and the momenta of macroscopic systems. Consequences for
statistical mechanics and possible observable effects are discussed.
