90 km/s. The red continuum brightness of the ring can be fully explained by the
evolving stars present in the trailing part of the wave. However the red
continuum brightness in regions internal to the ring indicates that the wave of
star formation propagates in a pre-existing stellar disk in the Cartwheel. The
H_alpha and K-band surface brightness profiles in VIIZw466 match the values
expected from stellar populations produced by a wave of star formation

recovers the entire distribution function rather than just its second moment.

properties appear qualitatively consistent with a scenario of Omega=1 CDM in

b) the quasars, with a lifetime of t~10^8 yr, sparsely sample halos of mass
greater than M_min~10^12-10^13 h^-1 M_sun. We discuss also the possibility that

  near 77 K","4 pages, Latex, This paper was presented in 'OD1-7', MT-15, Beijin,
  China (1997)",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Peltier current lead was proposed to reduce heat leak from the current lead.
The temperature of the hot side of semiconductors was kept to be room
temperature and the liquid nitrogen was used to cool the system in the
experiment. The experiment confirmed the principle of the Peltier current lead,
and the reduction of the heat leak is calculated to be 30 % for the liquid
helium system and 40 % for the liquid nitrogen system. We also proposed a new
current lead system which is composed of semiconductors and high temperature
superconducting material (HTS). This idea bases on the functionally gradient
material (FGM), and the HTS is connected to the semiconductor directly. The
temperature of the hot side of semiconductor is kept to be the liquid nitrogen
temperature, the temperature of HTS can be expected to be lower than 77 K.
Therefore, we can expect high current capacity of the HTS and/or high stability
of the HTS. We use BiSb as a N-type semiconductor and BiTe as a P-type
semiconductor in the experiment, and the temperature of the cold side of the
semiconductor is 73 K in this experiment.

order parameter has been known for long and no vortices are present in the
linear regime. However, if the sample is not symmetric, there exist ranges of
the field for which the order parameter vanishes along a line, parallel to the
field. In many respects, the behavior of this line is qualitatively different
from that of the vortices encountered in type II superconductivity. For samples
with mirror symmetry, this flux-induced vortex appears at the thin side for
small fluxes and at the opposite side for large fluxes. We propose direct and
indirect experimental methods which could test our predictions.

operator developed from the heavy quark expansion of quantum chromodynamics is
employed. We show that the selection rule that hybrid mesons do not decay to
identical S-wave mesons, found in other models, is preserved. We predict decays
of charmonium hybrids, discuss decays of J^PC=1^-+ exotic isovector hybrids of
various masses, and interpret the \pi(1800) as a hybrid meson.

implies quantum mechanics. This approach takes the canonical variables to be
dependent by the relation p=\partial_q S_0 and exploits a basic

looked for the special transformations leading to the free system with
vanishing energy. Furthermore, we saw that while on the one hand the
equivalence principle cannot be consistently implemented in classical
mechanics, on the other it naturally led to the quantum analogue of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation, thus implying the Schroedinger equation. In this
letter we show that actually the principle uniquely leads to this solution.
Furthermore, we find the map reducing any system to the free one with vanishing
energy and derive the transformations on S_0 leaving the wave function
invariant. We also express the canonical and Schroedinger equations by means of
the brackets recently introduced in the framework of N=2 SYM. These brackets

sheaves (known as equivariant sheaves) over toric varieties, due in part to A.
A. Klyachko. We apply this technology to heterotic compactifications, in
particular to the (0,2) models of Distler, Kachru, and also discuss how
knowledge of equivariant sheaves can be used to reconstruct information about
an entire moduli space of sheaves. Many results relevant to heterotic
compactifications previously known only to mathematicians are collected here --
for example, results concerning whether the restriction of a stable sheaf to a
Calabi-Yau hypersurface remains stable are stated. We also describe
substructure in the Kahler cone, in which moduli spaces of sheaves are
independent of Kahler class only within any one subcone. We study F theory
compactifications in light of this fact, and also discuss how it can be seen in
the context of equivariant sheaves on toric varieties. Finally we briefly
speculate on the application of these results to (0,2) mirror symmetry.

lightlike. In almost all cases the amplitudes at each order of perturbation
theory diverge in the limit, due to strong interactions among the longitudinal
zero modes. The lightlike limit generally exists nonperturbatively, but is more
complicated than might have been assumed. Some implications for the matrix
theory conjecture are discussed.

section which runs over the three traditional regions at intermediate energies:
the quasielastic peak, the dip region and the delta region. The longitudinal
and transverse response functions in the quasielastic peak have also been
evaluated. Traditional effects like polarization, meson exchange currents,
final state interaction and delta renormalization in the nuclear medium have
been included.
  Meson exchange currents are generated from a model of pion electroproduction
on the nucleon which reproduces accurately the experimental data.
  The inclusive cross section accounts for 1N,2N,3N mechanisms of virtual
photon absorption and one pion production. Meson exchange currents associated
to the (\gamma^*,2\pi) reaction are also accounted for.
  We obtain good results for the (e,e') cross sections in the whole energy
range and for different nuclei. The response functions are also in good
agreement with the latest experimental analysis. On the other hand, the method
provides the separation of the contribution to the inclusive cross section from
different physical channels which is a necessary input to evaluate cross
sections like (e,e' N), (e,e' NN), (e,e' \pi) etc.

is to decompose the self energy of the nucleons into Lorentz scalar and vector
components. A new method is introduced for this decomposition. It is based on
the dependence of the single-particle energy on the small component in the
Dirac spinors used to calculate the matrix elements of the underlying NN
interaction. The resulting Dirac components of the self-energy depend on the
momentum of the nucleons. At densities around and below the nuclear matter
saturation density this momentum dependence is dominated by the non-locality of
the Brueckner G matrix. At higher densities these correlation effects are
suppressed and the momentum dependence due to the Fock exchange terms is
getting more important. Differences between symmetric nuclear matter and
neutron matter are discussed. Various versions of the Bonn potential are
considered.

Using the phase space formalism a compact summation formula for the Wigner
function at rational multiples of the Talbot distance is derived. The summation
formula shows that the fractional Talbot image in the phase space is generated
by a finite sum of spatially displaced Wigner functions of the source field.

Hamiltonian dynamical systems. Their admissible combinations are singled out by
the requirement that the group of the Lie automorphisms be contained in the
group of the order automorphisms (Lie algebras with invariant cones). Taking
advantage of the reciprocal independence of the relevant structures, the
inclusion relation between the two automorphism groups can be reversed; a
procedure which leads to an entirely new formal language (ordered linear spaces
with invariant Lie products). Presumably it offers an alternative description
for quantum systems, radically different from the conventional algebraic
models.
