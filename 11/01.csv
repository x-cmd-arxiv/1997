1.2-Jy redshift survey of IRAS galaxies by means of the genus statistic. Four
high-resolution simulations of variants of the CDM cosmology are considered: a
flat standard model (SCDM), a variant of it with more large-scale power (tCDM),
and two low density universes, one open (OCDM) and one flat (LCDM). The fully
sampled N-body simulations are examined down to strongly nonlinear scales, both
with spatially fixed smoothing, and with an adaptive smoothing technique. While
the tCDM, LCDM, and OCDM simulations have very similar genus statistics in the
regime accessible to fixed smoothing, they can be separated with adaptive
smoothing at small mass scales. In order to compare the N-body models with the
1.2-Jy survey, we extract large ensembles of mock catalogues from the
simulations. These mock surveys are used to test for systematic effects in the
genus analysis and to establish the distribution of errors of the genus curve.
We find that a simple multivariate analysis of the genus measurements is
compromised both by non-Gaussian distributed errors and by noise that dominates
the covariance matrix. We therefore introduce a principal components analysis
of the genus curve. With a likelihood ratio test we find that the 1.2-Jy data
favours the LCDM, tCDM and OCDM models compared to SCDM. When genus
measurements for different smoothing scales are combined, the SCDM model can be
excluded at a 99% confidence level, while the other three models fit the 1.2-Jy
data well. (abridged)

dynamical structure and origin. The construction of velocity field models is
greatly simplified by assuming an approximate geometrical form for the
streamlines of the mean stellar motions. We test the conjecture that confocal
streamlines are a valid approximation for realistic triaxial systems. We
numerically integrate orbits in Schwarzschild's logarithmic potential, and fit
confocal streamlines to their mean velocity fields by minimizing the RMS
magnitude of the cross product between the velocity vectors and the
streamlines. We find that most orbits at a given energy can be fitted by nearly
identical confocal systems. There are statistically significant differences
between the streamline parameters obtained for different orbit families, but
the differences are small. The fitted parameters reproduce, to high accuracy,
the boundary between short axis and outer long axis tubes, which is a direct

efforts to obtain accurate statistical measurements of triaxiality from

exhibited quasi-regular X-ray/infrared (IR) flares with a spacing of $\sim 30$
minutes. While the physical mechanism triggering the flares is currently
unknown, the one-to-one correspondence and consistent time offset between the
X-ray and IR flares establish a close link between the two. At late times in
the flares the X-ray and IR bands appear to ``decouple'', with the X-ray band
showing large-amplitude fast oscillations while the IR shows a much smoother,
more symmetrical decline. In at least three cases, the IR flare has returned to
near its minimum while the X-rays continue in the elevated oscillatory state,
ruling out thermal reprocessing of the X-ray flux as the source of IR flare.
Furthermore, observations of similar IR and radio flares by Fender et al.
(1997) imply that the source of the IR flux in such flares is synchrotron
emission. The common rise and subsequent decoupling of the X-ray and IR flux
and probable synchrotron origin of the IR emission is consistent with a
scenario wherein the IR flux originates in a relativistic plasma which has been
ejected from the inner accretion disk. In that case, these simultaneous
X-ray/IR flares from a black-hole/relativistic-jet system are the first clear
observational evidence linking of the time-dependent interaction of the jet and
the inner disk in decades of quasar and microquasar studies.

planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed
and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous
planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve
performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance
improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem
similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning
effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP
depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes
the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner
DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating
explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from
the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine
judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision

  199-230",,,"cs.AI",,"  Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model
for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the
state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve
POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea
is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is
provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current
state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is
consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the
original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal
policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By
controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it
is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and
approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in
details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP.
To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general
POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more
efficient than all previous exact algorithms.

  231-248",,,"cs.AI",,"  The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete
information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general
agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state
(controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function
is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a
prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his
reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action
to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are
considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able
to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the
other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is
the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable
processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result
refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We
prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the
competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high
probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It
is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect
monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case
there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run
optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove
that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect
monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to
long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from
previous work in this area.

compress and collapse in close binary systems as has recently been observed in
numerical (3+1) dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We
show that compression is driven by velocity-dependent relativistic hydrodynamic
terms which increase the self gravity of the stars. They also produce fluid
motion with respect to the corotating frame of the binary. We present numerical
and analytic results which confirm that such terms are insignificant for
uniform translation or when the hydrodynamics is constrained to rigid
corotation.
  However, when the hydrodynamics is unconstrained, the neutron star fluid
relaxes to a compressed nonsynchronized state of almost no net intrinsic spin
with respect to a distant observer.
  We also show that tidal decompression effects are much less than the
velocity-dependent compression terms. We discuss why several recent attempts to
analyze this effect with constrained hydrodynamics or an analysis of tidal
forces do not observe compression. We argue that an independent test of this
must include unconstrained relativistic hydrodynamics to sufficiently high
order that all relevant velocity-dependent terms and their possible
cancellations are included.
