diverse wavelengths: from the ground with CFHT, MMT and KECK and from Earth
orbit with HST, ROSAT and ASCA. Mass determinations are separately obtained
from galaxy virial motions and X-ray profile fitting. A simple beta-model fit
to the X-ray data yields a mass of (1.3+/-0.2) x10^{14} M_sun within 583 kpc of
the cluster center, but more general models fit all of our data better and
allow a wider range of masses that are consistent with the lensing data. In
addition, the X-ray data yield a mass distribution profile that is well
described by a beta model with a core radius of 26.7 kpc. The velocity
dispersion of galaxies yields a mass of 4.8^{+1.5}_{-0.94} x 10^{14} M_sun

strong gravitationally lensed images of background sources. Models of the
cluster mass distribution and its lensing properties reveal 5 background
sources at various redshifts each forming 2 or more arcs. At 100 kpc, the lower
limit mass from lensing is about a factor of 2 greater than the X-ray
determined mass. lens model than the X-ray determination. To reconcile the mass
estimates from the X-rays and the lensing and to try to understand the steep
slope of the gravitational lens mass, we tentatively explore a model with a
supercluster surrounding the cluster and with a mass profile that increases
more rapidly than a beta model at large radii.

(AGNs), though its physical origin is still open to question. To study the
origin of the optical -- ultraviolet variability in AGN, we compare light
curves of two models to observations of quasar 0957+561 in terms of a structure
function analysis. In the starburst (SB) model, random superposition of
supernovae in the nuclear starburst region produce aperiodic luminosity
variations, while in the disk-instability (DI) model, variability is caused by
instabilities in the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. We
calculate fluctuating light curves and structure functions, $V(\tau)$, by
simple Monte-Carlo simulations on the basis of the two models. Each resultant
$V(\tau)$ possesses a power-law portion, $[V(\tau)]^{1/2} \propto
\tau^{\beta}$, at short time lags ($\tau$). The two models can be distinguished
by the logarithmic slope, $\beta$; $\beta \sim$ 0.74--0.90 in the SB model and
$\beta \sim$ 0.41--0.49 in the DI model, while the observed light curves
exhibit $\beta \sim$ 0.35. Therefore, we conclude that the DI model is favored
over the SB model to explain the slopes of the observational structure
function, in the case of 0957+561, though this object is a radio-loud object
and thus not really a fair test for the SB model. In addition, we examine the
time-asymmetry of the light curves by calculating $V(\tau)$ separately for
brightening and decaying phases. The two models exhibit opposite trends of
time-asymmetry to some extent, although the present observation is not long
enough to test this prediction.

shown that a linear quark mass dependence is required (in the confinement part
