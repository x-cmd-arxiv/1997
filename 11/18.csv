simulations is to use the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). Although the ZA
correctly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocity
perturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented because of the ZA
failure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time for the actual
dynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density and
velocity fields. We extend perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as
non-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the IC. We focus on
higher-order statistics of the density contrast and velocity divergence,
characterized by the S_p and T_p parameters. We find that the time-scale of
transients is determined, at a given order p, by the spectral index n. The
skewness factor S_3 (T_3) attains 10% accuracy only after a=6 (a=15) for n=0,
whereas higher (lower) n demands more (less) expansion away from the IC. These
requirements become much more stringent as p increases. An Omega=0.3 model
requires a factor of two larger expansion than an Omega=1 model to reduce
transients by the same amount. The predicted transients in S_p are in good
agreement with numerical simulations. More accurate IC can be achieved by using
2nd order Lagrangian PT (2LPT), which reproduces growing modes up to 2nd order
and thus eliminates transients in the skewness. We show that for p>3 this
reduces the required expansion by more than an order of magnitude compared to
the ZA. Setting up 2LPT IC only requires minimal, inexpensive changes to ZA
codes. We suggest simple steps for its implementation.

systematically different: (1) The metal-rich clusters are more centrally

elongated roughly along the major axis of the parent galaxy, while the
metal-poor clusters are essentially spherically distributed. In general, the
metal-rich clusters closely follow the underlying halo starlight of NGC 4472 in

not. The global value of the specific frequency of the globular clusters in NGC

under the Illarionov & Sunyaev (1975) disk formation criteria for accretion
from the strong stellar wind of Wolf-Rayet star disk accretion is possible only
for orbital periods below \sim 10 hr. However, the number of such short-period
systems is vanishingly small. If the accretor in Cyg X-3 is a 10 M_sun black

accretion may be responsible for the formation of jets in Cyg X-3 and may also
support an X-ray luminosity as high as \sim 10^{39} erg/s. From the orbital
period distribution for neutron stars with massive helium companions we find
that if during the common envelope phase a neutron star accretes at Eddington
rate and spins-up to the equilibrium period, then in most systems it acts as a
``propeller'' and accretion from the WR star wind is impossible. For the model
with two massive helium stars as an immediate progenitor of Cyg X-3,

detected at energies above 3 MeV. During the last year there is only evidence
for the quasar at energies below 3 MeV indicating a spectral change. The
time-averaged COMPTEL energy spectrum between 0.75 MeV and 30 MeV is well
represented by a power-law shape. Spectra collected from different
observational periods reveal different power-law shapes: a hard state during
flaring observations reported by EGRET, and a soft state otherwise. The
combined simultaneous EGRET and COMPTEL spectra indicate these two spectral
states as well. During low intensisty gamma-ray phases no spectral break is
obvious from the combined COMPTEL and EGRET measurements. For the gamma-ray
flaring phases however, the combined COMPTEL and EGRET data require a spectral
bending at MeV-energies. By fitting broken power-law functions the best-fit
values for the break in photon index range between 0.6 and 1.7, and for the
break energy between ~5 MeV and ~20 MeV. Because the flux values measured by
COMPTEL below 3 MeV in both states are roughly equal, the observations would be
consistent with an additional spectral component showing up during gamma-ray
flaring phases of PKS 0528+134. Such a component could be introduced by e.g. a
high-energy electron-positron population with a low-energy cutoff in their bulk
Lorentz factor distribution. The multiwavelength spectrum of PKS 0528+134 for

pronounced structure with a sharp edge at the kinematical endpoint even in such
an inclusive final state over a significant part of parameter space. We
determine the domain of parameter space where the edge is expected to be

scenario involves at least two scalar fields, the inflaton field $\phi$, and
the symmetry breaking field $\sigma$. We found that the behavior of these
fields after inflation, as well as the possibility of preheating (particle
production due to parametric resonance), depends crucially on the ratio of the
coupling constant $\lambda$ (self-interaction of the field $\sigma$) to the
coupling constant $g^2$ (interaction of $\phi$ and $\sigma$). For $\lambda \gg
g^2$, the oscillations of the field $\sigma$ soon after inflation become very
small, and all the energy is concentrated in the oscillating field $\phi$. For
$\lambda \sim g^2$ both fields $\sigma$ and $\phi$ oscillate in a rather
chaotic way, but eventually their motion stabilizes, and parametric resonance
with production of $\chi$ particles becomes possible. For $\lambda \ll g^2$ the
oscillations of the field $\phi$ soon after inflation become very small, and
all the energy is concentrated in the oscillating field $\sigma$. Preheating
can be efficient if the effective masses of the fields $\phi$ and $\sigma$ are
much greater than the Hubble constant, or if these fields are coupled to other
light scalar (or vector) fields $\chi$. In the recently proposed hybrid models
with a second stage of inflation after the phase transition, both preheating
and usual reheating are inefficient. Therefore for a very long time the
universe remains in a state with vanishing pressure. As a result, density
contrasts generated during the phase transition in these models can grow and
collapse to form primordial black holes. Under certain conditions, most of the
energy density after inflation will be stored in small black holes, which will
later evaporate and reheat the universe.

gerbe and discusses some new examples arising in quantum field theory. One
application is to an Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theory construction of the
bundle of fermionic Fock spaces parametrized by vector potentials in odd space
dimensions and a proof that this leads in a simple manner to the known
Schwinger terms (Mickelsson-Faddeev cocycle) for the gauge group action. This
gives an explicit computation of the Dixmier-Douady class of the associated
bundle gerbe. The method works also in other cases of fermions in external
fields (external gravitational field, for example) provided that the APS
theorem can be applied; however, we have worked out the details only in the
case of vector potentials. Another example, in which the bundle gerbe curvature
plays a role, arises from the WZW model on Riemann surfaces. A further example
is the `existence of string structures' question. We conclude by showing how
global Hamiltonian anomalies fit within this framework.

section in the one-boson exchange approximation. The final expressions allow a
satisfactory fit of the Coulomb substracted proton-proton cross section data in
vacuum. At finite density or temperature the cross section is reduced as
compared to the vacuum values and compatible with the existing experimental
constraints. At high density the $p$-$p$ differential cross section gets
increasingly forward and backward peaked. The $\sigma$-$\omega$ mixing plays a

a more reliable estimate of the odd-even splitting of the potentials than
previously found, suggesting a rather moderate role for this splitting in
deuteron-nucleus scattering generally. The approximate parity-independence of
the deuteron optical potentials is shown to arise from the nontrivial
interference between antisymmetrization and channel coupling to the deuteron
breakup channels. A further comparison of the empirical potentials established
here and the double folding potential derived from the M3Y effective NN force
(with the appropriate normalisation factor) reveals strong similarities. This
result supports the application of the double folding model, combined with a
small Majorana component, to the description even of such a loosely bound
projectile as the deuteron. In turn, support is given for the application of
iterative-perturbative inversion in combination with the double folding model
to study fine details of the nucleus-nucleus potential. A $d$-$^4$He tensor
potential is also derived to reproduce correctly the negative $^6$Li quadrupole
moment and the D-state asymptotic constant.
