discovered by Libgober and Wood that the product of the Chern classes

been used by Eguchi, Jinzenji and Xiong in their approach to the quantum

$c_1c_{n-1}$ for smooth $n$-folds. We show that the number $c_{st}^{1,n-1}(X)$
can be expressed in the same way using the stringy Hodge numbers of $X$. Our
results provides an evidence for the existence of an approach to quantum

the stringy Euler number of $X$.

distributions in test-particle regimes, where the shock dynamics are dominated
by the thermal populations that provide the seed particles for the acceleration

for the lens shear, which is unknown from the variation in number counts alone.
Furthermore, one needs to go beyond the weak lensing (linear) approximation as
most of the observational data is concentrated in the central parts of
clusters, where the lensing is strong. By studying the lensing properties of a
complete catalogue of galaxy cluster models, one can find reasonable
approximations about the lens shear as a function of the lens convergence. We
show that using these approximations one can fairly well reconstruct the

assumptions about the galaxy distribution and the galaxy-dark matter
cross-correlations. We argue that on large scales the central limit theorem
generically assures Gaussianity of each smoothed density field, but not
coherence. Asymptotically, the only surviving parameters on a given scale are
galaxy variance $\sigma$, bias $b=\Omega^{.6}/\beta$ and the galaxy-dark matter
correlation coefficient $r$. These can all be determined by measuring the
quadrupole and octupole velocity distortions in the power spectrum. Measuring
them simultaneously may restore consistency between all $\beta$ determinations
independent of galaxy type.
  The leading deviations from Gaussianity are conveniently parameterized by an
Edgeworth expansion. In the mildly non-linear regime, two additional parameters
describe the full picture: the skewness parameter $s$ and non-linear bias
$b_2$. They can both be determined from the measured skewness combined with
second order perturbation theory or from an N-body simulation. By measuring the
redshift distortion of the skewness, one can measure the density parameter
$\Omega$ with minimal assumptions about the galaxy formation process. This
formalism also provides a convenient parametrization to quantify statistical
galaxy formation properties.

contribute to the galactic diffuse emission, and whether unresolved gamma-ray
pulsars could be responsible for the excess of diffuse galactic emission above
1 GeV which has been observed by EGRET. The diffuse gamma-ray intensity due to
unresolved pulsars is directly linked to the number of objects which should be
observed in the EGRET data. We can therefore use our knowledge of the
unidentified EGRET sources to constrain model parameters like the pulsar birth
rate, their beaming angle, etc. This analysis is based only on the properties
of the six pulsars which have been identified in the EGRET data, and is
independent of choice of a pulsar emission model. We find that pulsars
contribute very little to the diffuse emission at lower energies, whereas above
1 GeV they can account for 18% of the observed intensity in selected regions
for a reasonable number of directly observable gamma-ray pulsars (14). The
latitude distribution of the diffuse emission caused by unresolved pulsars is
narrower than that of the observed diffuse emission. While the excess above 1
GeV gamma-ray energy is observed up to at least 6-8 degrees off the plane, the
pulsar contribution would be small there. Thus pulsars do significantly
contribute to the diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission above 1 GeV, but they can
not be made responsible for all the discrepancy between observed intensity and
model predictions in this energy range.

the dynamics is represented by a unitary evolution in a Hilbert space, and how
they are related to the theory of continual measurements. An essential tool is
an isomorphism between the bosonic Fock space and the Wiener space, which allow
to connect certain quantum objects with probabilistic ones.

gravity and study their stability against nonaxisymmetric Jacobi-like bar
modes. PN configurations are modeled by homogeneous triaxial ellipsoids and the
metric is obtained as a solution of Einstein's equations in 3+1 ADM form. We
use an approximate subset of the equations well-suited to numerical integration
for strong field, 3D configurations in quasi--equilibrium. These equations are
exact at PN order, and admit an analytic solution for homogeneous ellipsoids.
In this paper we present this solution, as well as analytic functionals for the
conserved global quantities, M, M_0 and J. By using a variational principle we
construct sequences of axisymmetric equilibria of constant density and rest
mass, i.e. the PN generalization of Maclaurin spheroids, which are compared to
other PN and full relativistic sequences presented by previous authors. We then
consider nonaxisymmetric ellipsoidal deformations of the configurations,
holding J constant and the rotation uniform, and we locate the point at which
the bar modes will be driven secularly unstable by a dissipative agent like
viscosity. We find that the value of the eccentricity, as well as the ratios
\Omega^2/(\pi\rho_0) and T/|W|, defined invariantly, all increase at the onset
of instability as the stars become more relativistic. Since higher degrees of
rotation are required to trigger a viscosity-driven bar mode as the star's
compactness increases, the effect of GR is to weaken the instability, at least
to PN order. This behavior is opposite to that found for secular instability
via Dedekind-like modes driven unstable by gravitational radiation, supporting
the suggestion that in GR, nonaxisymmetric modes driven unstable by viscosity
and gravitational radiation may no longer coincide.

for the $^{35}$Cl+$^{24}$Mg system at an incident beam energy of E$_{Lab}$= 282
MeV. Charge distributions, inclusive energy spectra, and angular distributions
have been obtained for the evaporation residues and the binary fragments.
Angle-integrated cross sections have been determined for evaporation residues
from both the complete and incomplete fusion mechanisms. Energy spectra for
binary fragment channels near to the entrance-channel mass partition are
characterized by an inelastic contribution that is in addition to a fully
energy damped component. The fully damped component which is observed in all
the binary mass channels can be associated with decay times that are comparable
to, or longer than the rotation period. The observed mass-dependent cross
sections for the fully damped component are well reproduced by the fission
transition-state model, suggesting a fusion followed by fission origin. The
present data cannot, however, rule out the possibility that a long-lived
orbiting mechanism accounts for part or all of this yield.

"quant-ph/9711027",,"Keiji matsumoto","Uhlmann's parallelism in quantum estimation theory",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  Two important classes of the quantum statistical model, the locally
quasi-classical model and the quasi-classical model, are introduced from the
estimation theoretical viewpoint, and they are characterized geometrically by
the vanishing conditions of the relative phase factor (RPF), implying the close
tie between Uhlmann parallel transport and the quantum estimation theory.

  problem","8 p. LaTex. Corrections in eqns (5) and (7)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  k:th power (amplitude-)squeezed states are defined as the normalized states
giving equality in the Schroedinger-Robertson uncertainty relation for the real
and imaginary parts of the k:th power of the one-mode annihilation operator.
Equivalently they are the set of normalized eigenstates (for all possible
complex eigenvalues) of the Bogolubov transformed ""k:th power annihilation
operators"". Expressed in the number representation the eigenvalue equation
leads to a three term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients, which
can be explicitly solved in the cases k = 1, 2. The solutions are essentially
Hermite and Pollaczek polynomials, respectively. k = 1 gives the ordinary
squeezed states, i.e. displaced squeezed vacua. For k equal to or larger than
three, where no explicit solution has been found, the recursion relation for
the symmetric operator given by the real part of the k:th power of the
annihilation operator defines a Jacobi matrix corresponding to a classical
Hamburger moment problem, which is undetermined. This implies that the operator
has an infinity of self-adjoint extensions, all with disjoint discrete spectra.
The corresponding squeezed states are well-defined, however.

understood as a process in classical electrodynamics, in which a nonlinear
crystal couples the modes of the pumping field with those of the zeropoint, or

with the presently accepted nonlocal theory. The new theory predicts a hitherto
unsuspected phenomenon - parametric up conversion from the vacuum.

  http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9712001 http://www.keyinnov.demon.co.uk",,,"MUM-97-12","quant-ph",,"  In a series of articles we have shown that all parametric-down- conversion
processes, both of type-I and type-II, may be described by a positive Wigner
density. These results, together with our description of how light detectors
subtract the zeropoint radiation, indicated the possibility of a completely
local realist theory of all these processes. In the present article we show how
the down-converted fields may be described as retarded fields, generated by
currents inside the nonlinear crystal, thereby achieving such a theory. Most of
its predictions coincide with the standard nonlocal theory. However, the
intensities of the down converted signals do not correspond exactly with the
photon pairs of the nonlocal theory. For example, in a blue- red down
conversion we would find 1.03 red ""photons"" for every blue one. The theory also
predicts a new phenomenon, namely parametric up conversion from the vacuum.
