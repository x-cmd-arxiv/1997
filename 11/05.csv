10^4 M_\odot$), either as relativistic star clusters or as single supermassive
stars (which may result from stellar mergers in dense star clusters), could be
a cosmological source of $\gamma$-ray bursts. These events could provide the
seeds of the supermassive black holes observed at the center of many galaxies.
Collapsing supermassive objects will release a fraction of their huge
gravitational binding energy as thermal neutrino pairs. We show that the
accompanying neutrino/antineutrino annihilation-induced heating could drive
electron/positron ``fireball'' formation, relativistic expansion, and
associated $\gamma$-ray emission. The major advantage of this model is its
energetics: supermassive object collapses are far more energetic than solar
mass-scale compact object mergers; therefore, the conversion of gravitational
energy to fireball kinetic energy in the supermassive object scenario need not
be highly efficient, nor is it necessary to invoke directional beaming. The
major weakness of this model is difficulty in avoiding a baryon loading problem
for one dimensional collapse scenarios.

galaxies and its evolution to higher redshift offers the possibility of a
direct measurement of $\Omega_0$ with little contribution from other
cosmological parameters. We investigate the significance of recent claims that
this evolution indicates that $\Omega_0$ must be small. The most recent cluster
velocity dispersion function from a compilation including the ESO Northern
Abell Cluster Survey (ENACS) results in a significantly higher normalization
for models, corresponding to $\sigma_8\approx 0.6$ for $\Omega_0=1$, compared
to the Eke, Cole, & Frenk result of $\sigma_8=0.52\pm 0.04$. Using the ENACS
data for a $z=0$ calibration results in strong evolution in the abundance of
clusters, and we find that the velocity dispersion function is consistent with
$\Omega_0=1$. The results are dependent upon the choice and analysis of
low-redshift and high-redshift data, so at present, the data is not good enough
to determine $\Omega_0$ unambiguously.

based on simulation results of tidal collisions (Aguilar & White 1985), we
propose simple rules for energy exchanges during collisions that allow to
discriminate between different Hubble types: efficient collisions result in the
disruption of disks and substantial star formation, leading to the formation of
elliptical galaxies; inefficient collisions allow a large gas reservoir to
survive and form disks. Assuming that galaxy formation proceeds in a Omega_0=1
Cold Dark Matter universe, the model both reproduces a number of observations
and makes predictions, among which are the redshifts of formation of the
different Hubble types in the field. When the model is normalized to the
present day abundance of X-ray clusters, the amount of energy exchange needed
to produce elliptical galaxies in the field implies that they formed at z>2.5
while spiral galaxies formed at z<1.5. The model also offers a natural
explanation for biasing between the various morphological types. We find that
the present day morphology-density relation in the field is well reproduced
under the collision hypothesis. Finally, predictions of the evolution of the
various galaxy populations with redshift are made, in the field as well as in
clusters.

from Herbig Ae/Be stars arise in the same manner as those from T-Tauri stars,
i.e. through accretion driven mass-loss. We also find that the [OI] 6300A line
luminosity correlates better with excess infrared luminosity than with stellar
luminosities, again supporting the idea that Herbig Ae/Be winds are accretion
driven. If one includes the lower mass analogues of the Herbig Ae/Be stars with
forbidden line emission, i.e. the classical T-Tauri stars, the correlation
between mass-loss rate and infrared excess spans 5 orders of magnitude in

  workshop on the Internal Structure of Black Holes and Spacetime
  Singularities, Haifa June 29 - July 3, 1997",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Recent numerical simulations have found that the Cauchy horizon inside
spherical charged black holes, when perturbed nonlinearly by a
self-gravitating, minimally-coupled, massless, spherically-symmetric scalar
field, turns into a null weak singularity which focuses monotonically to $r=0$
at late times, where the singularity becomes spacelike.
  Our main objective is to study this spacelike singularity. We study
analytically the spherically-symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar equations
asymptotically near the singularity. We obtain a series-expansion solution for
the metric functions and for the scalar field near $r=0$ under the simplifying
assumption of homogeneity. Namely, we neglect spatial derivatives and keep only
temporal derivatives. We find that there indeed exists a generic spacelike
singularity solution for these equations (in the sense that the solution
depends on enough free parameters), with similar properties to those found in
the numerical simulations. This singularity is strong in the Tipler sense,
namely, every extended object would inevitably be crushed to zero volume. In
this sense this is a similar singularity to the spacelike singularity inside
uncharged spherical black holes. On the other hand, there are some important
differences between the two cases. Our model can also be extended to the more
general inhomogeneous case.
  The question of whether the same kind of singularity evolves in more
realistic models (of a spinning black hole coupled to gravitational
perturbations) is still an open question.

cannot change, after changes of velocity and potentials of a measuring system,
the relativistic changes of any particle and any stationary radiation (like
those used to measure it) must occur in identical proportion. Thus particles
and stationary radiations must have the same general physical properties. In
principle more exact and better defined physical laws for particles and their
gravitational (G) fields can be derived from properties of particle models made
up of radiation in stationary states after using fixed reference frames that
don't change in the same way as the objects. Effectively, the new laws derived
in this way do correspond with relativistic quantum mechanics and with all of
the G tests. The main difference with current gravity is the linearity fixed by
the EEP, i.e., the G field itself has not a real field energy to exchange with
the bodies and it is not a secondary source of field. G work liberates energy
confined in the models stationary states. The EEP also fixes a new
astrophysical context that has fundamental differences with the current ones.
This one has been presented in a separated work as a test for the EEP. The
whole theory,including the new universe context fixed by the EEP, was published
in a book.

values within either exact quantum-mechanical calculations with the Woods-Saxon
(WS) potential, or Thomas-Fermi approximation with WS as well as finite-square
potential wells, provided that the free-gas contribution is subtracted. A
similar trend is obtained by means of the simple FGM formula for the s.p.l.
density if the continuum effect is taken into account.

reactions at energies near and below the Coulomb barrier, focusing especially
on the role of anharmonicities. We carry out a systematic study of those
effects on the excitation function of the fusion cross section and on the
fusion barrier distribution, by using the vibrational limit of the interacting
boson model. We also analyze the recently measured high-precision data of the
$^{16}$O + $^{148}$Sm fusion reaction with this model and discuss the
anharmonic properties of the quadrupole as well as the octupole vibrations in
$^{148}$Sm. Negative and positive static quadrupole moments are deduced for the
first 2$^+$ and 3$^-$ states in $^{148}$Sm, respectively. It is shown that the
fusion barrier distribution strongly depends on the sign of the quadrupole
moments, suggesting that subbarrier fusion reactions offer an alternative
method to extract the static quadrupole moments of phonon states in spherical
nuclei.

  manifold and the global ground state of the parallel configuration","submitted to Physical Review A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.57.1767",,"physics.chem-ph",,"  The electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule in a magnetic field is
investigated for parallel internuclear and magnetic field axes. The lowest
states of the $\Pi$ manifold are studied for spin singlet and triplet$(M_s =
-1) $ as well as gerade and ungerade parity for a broad range of field
strengths $0 \leq B \leq 100 a.u.$ For both states with gerade parity we
observe a monotonous decrease in the dissociation energy with increasing field
strength up to $B = 0.1 a.u.$ and metastable states with respect to the
dissociation into two H atoms occur for a certain range of field strengths. For
both states with ungerade parity we observe a strong increase in the
dissociation energy with increasing field strength above some critical field
strength $B_c$. As a major result we determine the transition field strengths
for the crossings among the lowest $^1\Sigma_g$, $^3\Sigma_u$ and $^3\Pi_u$
states. The global ground state for $B \lesssim 0.18 a.u.$ is the strongly
bound $^1\Sigma_g$ state. The crossings of the $^1\Sigma_g$ with the
$^3\Sigma_u$ and $^3\Pi_u$ state occur at $B \approx 0.18$ and $B \approx0.39
a.u.$, respectively. The transition between the $^3\Sigma_u$ and $^3\Pi_u$
state occurs at $B \approx 12.3 a.u.$ Therefore, the global ground state of the
hydrogen molecule for the parallel configuration is the unbound $^3\Sigma_u$
state for $0.18 \lesssim B \lesssim 12.3 a.u.$ The ground state for $B \gtrsim
12.3 a.u.$ is the strongly bound $^3\Pi_u$ state. This result is of great
relevance to the chemistry in the atmospheres of magnetic white dwarfs and
neutron stars.

Darboux-Backlund transformation for the Manin-Radul super KdV hierarchy. The
geometrical intepretation of these transformations is also briefly discussed.
