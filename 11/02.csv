in the nearby star forming regions. The surveys covered approximately 56 degree
in Perseus, Taurus, Orion, Monoceros, and other regions. Using refined
techniques, we discovered in total 68 HH objects, of which 32 were in Perseus,
4 in Taurus, 13 in Orion, 18 in Monoceros, and 1 in S287 regions. The newly
discovered HH objects demonstrate a great variety of morphological structures,
including 5 jets, 7 arcs, 12 cirri or cirrus groups, 13 patches, and many
knots. These objects provide a new comprehensive database for the study of HH
objects in the regions of recent star formation.

chains with Luttinger interaction within each chain. We construct a
perturbation theory in the inter-chain hopping term and find that there is a
power law dependence of the Hall conductivity on the magnetic field with an
exponent depending on the interaction constant. We show that this perturbation
theory becomes valid if the magnetic field is sufficiently large.

negatively charged hadrons have been measured for minimum bias proton-nucleus
and deuteron-gold interactions, as well as central oxygen-gold and
sulphur-nucleus collisions at 200 GeV per nucleon. The rapidity density of net
protons at midrapidity in central nucleus-nucleus collisions increases both
with target mass for sulphur projectiles and with the projectile mass for a
gold target. The shape of the rapidity distributions of net protons forward of
midrapidity for d+Au and central S+Au collisions is similar. The average
rapidity loss is larger than 2 units of rapidity for reactions with the gold
target. The transverse momentum spectra of net protons for all reactions can be
described by a thermal distribution with `temperatures' between 145 +- 11 MeV
(p+S interactions) and 244 +- 43 MeV (central S+Au collisions). The
multiplicity of negatively charged hadrons increases with the mass of the
colliding system. The shape of the transverse momentum spectra of negatively
charged hadrons changes from minimum bias p+p and p+S interactions to p+Au and
central nucleus-nucleus collisions. The mean transverse momentum is almost
constant in the vicinity of midrapidity and shows little variation with the
target and projectile masses. The average number of produced negatively charged
hadrons per participant baryon increases slightly from p+p, p+A to central
S+S,Ag collisions.

negative-parity L=1 baryons from the perspective of the large-$N_c$ expansion.
In the large-$N_c$ limit the mass spectrum and mixing pattern of these states
are constrained in a very specific way. The mixing angles are completely
determined in this limit, with predictions in good agreement with experiment.
In the combined large-$N_c$ and SU(3) limits the pion couplings of the five
negative-parity octets to the ground state baryons are given in terms of only 3
independent couplings. The large-$N_c$ predictions for the ratios of strong
couplings are tested against experimental data.

$(D-1)$ dimensional charged black holes by boosts. We show that the boost has
to be performed in the covering space and the boosted coordinate has to be
compactified on a circle with a Lorentz contracted radius. Using this fact we
show that the transition between Schwarzschild black holes to black p-branes
observed recently in M theory is the well-known black hole- black string
transition viewed in a boosted frame. In a similar way the correspondence point
where an excited string state goes over to a neutral black hole is mapped
exactly to the correspondence point for black p-branes. In terms of the $p$
brane quantities the equation of state for an excited string state becomes
identical to that of a 3+1 dimensional massless gas for all $p$. Finally, we
show how boosts can be used to relate Hawking radiation rates. Using the known
microscopic derivation of absorption by extremal 3-branes and near-extremal 5D
holes with three large charges we provide a microscopic derivation of
absorption of 0-branes by seven and five dimensional Schwarzschild black holes
in a certain regime.

features a ``mutator'' allele whose effect is to increase the mutation rate. We
show that the expected proportion of mutators far from equilibrium, when the
fitness is steadily increasing in time, is governed solely by the transition
rates into and out of the mutator state. This results is a much faster rate of
fitness increase than would be the case without the mutator allele. Near the
fitness equilibrium, however, the mutators are severely suppressed, due to the
detrimental effects of a large mutation rate near the fitness maximum. We
discuss the results of a recent experiment on natural selection of E. coli in
the light of our model.
