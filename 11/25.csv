Recently, Gottsche has generalized their conjecture to arbitrary g in terms of
quasi-modular forms. We prove these formulas using Gromov-Witten invariants for

Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras and some aspects of Mirror Symmetry, interesting
hyperbolic root systems should have restricted arithmetic type and a

  This series of papers is devoted to classification of hyperbolic root systems
of restricted arithmetic type and with a generalized lattice Weyl vector
$\rho$, having the rank 3 (it is the first non-trivial rank). In the Part I we
announce classification of the maximal hyperbolic root systems of elliptic
(i.e. $\rho^2 >0$) and parabolic (i.e. $\rho^2=0$) type, having the rank 3. We

suddenly when its luminosity was between (4-12) E35 ergs/s, assuming a 2.5 kpc

for spectral state transitions in soft X-ray transients, from soft high state
to hard low state and further to quiescent state. With this scheme accretion
onto neutron star may take place even during the propeller regime.

MeV curvature gamma-rays from $e^{-}$ or $e^{+}$ flowing starward out of such
accelerators are converted to electron-positron pairs on closed field lines all
around the star. These pairs strongly affect X-ray emission from near the star
in two ways. (1) The pairs are a source of synchrotron emission immediately
following their creation in regions where $B \sim 10^{10}$ G. This emission, in
the photon energy range 0.1 keV $\lesssim E_{X} \lesssim$ 5 MeV, has a
power-law spectrum with energy index 0.5 and X-ray luminosity that depends on
the backflow current, and is typically $\sim 10^{33}$ \lum. (2) The pairs
ultimately form a cyclotron resonance ``blanket'' surrounding the star except
for two holes along the open field line bundles which pass through it. In such
a blanket the gravitational pull on electron-positron pairs toward the star is
balanced by the hugely amplified push of outflowing surface emitted X-rays
wherever cyclotron resonance occurs. Because of it the neutron star is
surrounded by a leaky ``hohlraum'' of hot blackbody radiation with two small
holes, which prevents direct X-ray observation of a heated polar cap of a
gamma-ray pulsar. Weakly spin-modulated radiation from the blanket together

Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The 8 GHz image reveals a linear triple
structure (~4'', 1.5 kpc) oriented perpendicular to the optical polarization
position angle. It is aligned with the inner dust lane and shows strong
morphological association with the narrow emission line region (NLR). At 21 cm,
very broad (~700 km/s) HI absorption is observed against the strong continuum
source. This absorption is almost entirely blueshifted, indicating a fast net
outflow, but a faint and narrow redshifted component is also present. In IC
5063 we see clear evidence for strong shocks resulting from the radio
plasma-ISM interaction in the central few kpc. However, the energy flux in the
radio plasma is an order of magnitude smaller than the energy emitted in
emission lines. Thus, shocks are unlikely to account solely for the global
ionization of the emission line region, particularly at large distances.
  The HI emission outlines a warped disk associated with the system of dust
lanes some ~2' (~38 kpc) in radius. The lack of kinematically disturbed gas
outside the central few kpc, coupled with the disk warp and close morphological
connection of the inner dust lanes and the large-scale ionized gas, support the
idea that the gas at large radii is photoionized by the central region, while
shadowing effects are important in defining its X-shaped morphology. The
kinematics of the ionized and of the neutral gas suggests the existence of a
dark halo.

temperature decline between 1 and 6 X-ray core radii (0.15 and 0.9/h Mpc) can
be approximately quantified by a polytropic index of 1.2-1.3. Assuming such a
polytropic temperature profile, the gravitating mass within 1 and within 6 core
radii is approximately 1.35 and 0.7 times the isothermal beta-model estimates,
respectively.

the most asymmetric clusters, appear remarkably similar when plotted against
radius in units of the estimated virial radius. We compare the composite
temperature profile to the published hydrodynamic simulations. The observed
profiles appear steeper than those in most Lagrangian simulations (Evrard etal
1996; Eke etal 1997). The predictions for Omega=1 models are most discrepant,
while models with low Omega are closer to our data. We note, however, that at
least one Omega=1 Lagrangian simulation (Katz & White 1993) and the recent

results thus provide a new constraint for adjusting numerical simulations and,

February 1996 with the Proportional Counter Array on the Rossi X-ray Timing
Experiment (RXTE), have enabled the first measurement of the intrinsic pulse
period Ppulse since 1984: Ppulse=440.341[+0.012,-0.017] s. 4U 1907+09 is in a
binary system with a blue supergiant. The orbital parameters were solved and
this enabled the correction for orbital delay effects of a measurement of
Ppulse obtained in 1990 with Ginga. Thus, three spin down rates could be
extracted from four pulse periods obtained in 1983, 1984, 1990, and 1996. These
are within 8% equal to a value of dPpulse/dt=+0.225 s/yr. This suggest that the
pulsar is perhaps in a monotonous spin down mode since its discovery in 1983.
Furthermore, the RXTE observations show transient ~18 s oscillations during a
flare that lasted about 1 hour. The oscillations may be interpreted as
Keplerian motion of an accretion disk near the magnetospheric radius. This, and
the notion that the co-rotation radius is much larger than any conceivable
value for the magnetospheric radius (because of the long spin period), renders
it unlikely that this pulsar spins near equilibrium like is suspected for other
slowing accreting X-ray pulsars. We suggest as an alternative that perhaps the
frequent occurrence of a retrograde transient accretion disk may be
consistently slowing the pulsar down. Further observations of flares can
provide more evidence of this.

There is unfortunately no general agreement on the definition of such a

obtained with various measures of brightness can be used to select the quantity
which is closer to a standard candle. Our method relies on a few general
assumptions on the burster spatial distribution, namely that nearby bursters
are homogeneously distributed in an Euclidean space with no density or
luminosity evolution. We apply it to 5 measures of GRB brightness in the
Current BATSE Catalog and we find that the GRB size-frequency distribution
depends significantly on the energy window used to measure the GRB brightness.
The influence of the time window being, in comparison, negligible. Our method
suggests that the best distance indicator in this Catalog is the fluence

dislocations in the underlying crystal lattice is considered in the continuum
picture, where dislocations are represented by torsion of space. The possible
effects of torsion are investigated on the levels of classical motion,
non-relativistic quantum motion, and spin-torsion coupling terms derivable in
the non-relativistic limit of generalizations of the Dirac equation in a space
with torsion. Finally, phenomenological spin-torsion couplings analogous to
Pauli terms are considered in the non-relativistic equations. Different
prescriptions of classical and non-relativistic quantum motion in a space with
torsion are shown to give effects that should in principle be observable.
Semi-classical arguments are presented to show that torsion is not relevant for
the classical motion of the center of a wave packet. The correct semi-classical
limit can instead be described as classical trajectories in a Hamiltonian given
by the band energy. In the special case of a spherically symmetric band this
motion reduces to straight lines, independently of local crystal orientations.
By dimensional analysis the coupling constants of the possible spin-torsion
interactions are postulated to be proportional to a combination of the
effective mass of the electron, the lattice constant and $\hbar$. The
level-splitting is then very small with transition frequencies on the order of
1 kHz or smaller.

interaction option improves the description outside the jets. A reasonable
overall description of the \kz behaviour is possible with PYTHIA using a
reduced value of the strangeness suppression parameter. The numbers of $h^\pm$
and \kz within a jet as defined above are measured to be $3.25\pm0.02\pm0.28$
and $0.431\pm0.013\pm0.088$ respectively. Fragmentation functions are presented
for $h^\pm$ and \kz in photoproduced jets; agreement is found with calculations
of Binnewies et al. and, at higher momenta, with $p\bar p$ scattering and with
standard PYTHIA. Fragmentation functions in direct photoproduced events are
extracted, and at higher momenta give good agreement with data from related
processes in $e^+e^-$ annihilation and deep inelastic $ep$ scattering.

hypothesis that it represents a single pseudoscalar resonance. Assuming that it
arises due to the mixing between the glueball and the $q\bar q$ nearby states

obtained for the partial width $\Gamma(\iota/\eta(1440) \to K^* K)$ --- one for
the case when $\iota/\eta(1440)$ is mainly a glueball and another one when it
is mainly a radial excitation of the $s\bar s$ state. Both estimates are
obtained in the chiral perturbation theory approach taking into account the
available data on the vector mesons and the pseudoscalar state K(1460), which
is interpreted as a radial excitation of the $K$ meson. The same partial width
is independently estimated on the basis of the combined OBELIX and Crystal
Barrel data on the production of $\iota/\eta(1440)$ in $p\bar p$ annihilation.
