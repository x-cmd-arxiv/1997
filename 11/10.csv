distributions of the present-time dark matter haloes are analysed. An
analytical approach to the analysis of the angular momentum distributions
assumes that the haloes are initially homogeneous ellipsoids and that the
growth of the angular momentum of the haloes halts at their maximum expansion
time. However, the maximum expansion time cannot be determined uniquely,
because in the hierarchical clustering scenario each progenitor, or subunit, of
the halo has its own maximum expansion time. Therefore the merging history of
the halo may be important in estimating its angular momentum. Using the merger
tree model by Rodrigues & Thomas, which takes into account the spatial
correlations of the density fluctuations, we have investigated the effects of
the merging histories on the angular momentum distributions of dark matter
haloes. It was found that the merger effects, that is, the effects of the
inhomogeneity of the maximum expansion times of the progenitors which finally
merge together into a halo, do not strongly affect the final angular momentum
distributions, so that the homogeneous ellipsoid approximation happens to be
good for the estimation of the angular momentum distribution of dark matter
haloes. This is because the effect of the different directions of the angular
momenta of the progenitors cancels out the effect of the inhomogeneity of the
maximum expansion times of the progenitors.

their present luminosity function (LF) looks exponential. Evolutionary
synthesis models for star clusters of various metallicities are used to
individually age-date these clusters and describe their future luminosity and

changes the shape of the YSC LF from an exponential towards a Gaussian during
further evolution. This suggests that -- at least a major part of -- the YSCs
may well be GCs, implying that during a spiral-spiral merger+starburst the

around those galactocentric radii where they formed, the YSCs serve as tracers

renormalized coupling constant g in the symmetric phase of O(N) models, and the
corresponding Callan-Symanzik beta-function. In the framework of the 1/N
expansion we show that the Callan- Symanzik beta-function is non-analytic at
its zero, i.e. at the fixed-point value g^* of g. This fact calls for a check
of the actual accuracy of the determination of g^* from the resummation of the
d=3 perturbative g-expansion, which is usually performed assuming analyticity
of the beta-function. Two alternative approaches are exploited. We extend the
\epsilon-expansion of g^* to O(\epsilon^4). Quite accurate estimates of g^* are
then obtained by an analysis exploiting the analytic behavior of g^* as
function of d and the known values of g^* for lower-dimensional O(N) models,
i.e. for d=2,1,0. Accurate estimates of g^* are also obtained by a reanalysis
of the strong-coupling expansion of lattice N-vector models allowing for the
leading confluent singularity. The agreement among the g-, \epsilon-, and
strong-coupling expansion results is good for all N. However, at N=0,1,
\epsilon- and strong-coupling expansion favor values of g^* which are sligthly
lower than those obtained by the resummation of the g-expansion assuming
analyticity in the Callan-Symanzik beta-function.

resolution of the measuring device. This dependence is reproduced by the help
of a blocking transformation on the wave function. The systems with quadratic
hamiltonian are studied in details. The representation of the renormalization
group in the space of observables is identified.

spectrum of waves by the Black Hole has as a function of frequency a remarkable
oscillatory behaviour characteristic of a diffraction pattern. This is an
unique distinctive feature of the black hole absorption, and due to its r = 0
singularity. Ordinary absorptive bodies and optical models do not present these
features. The unitarity optical theorem is generalized to the Black Hole case
explicitly showing that absorption ocurrs only at the origin. All these results
allow to understand and reproduce the Black Hole absorption spectrum in terms
of Fresnel-Kirchoff diffraction theory: by the interference of the absorbed
rays arriving at the origin through different optical paths. These fundamental
features of the Black Hole Absorption will be present for generic higher
dimensional Black Hole backgrounds, and whatever the low energy effective
theory they arise from. In recent and increasing litterature devoted to compute
absorption cross sections (grey body factors) of black holes (whatever
ordinary, stringy, D-braned), the fundamental remarkable features of the Black
Hole Absorption spectrum are overlooked.

those relevant to the study of dualities in super Yang-Mills theories. The
association of Chan-Paton factors to D-brane multiplicities is possible in the

unclear for finite k. We show that the introduction of a magnetic field implies
a twist of the SU(2) current algebra in the open-string sector leading to

equilibration of the parton plasma showed that the system does not come close
to full equilibrium, especially for the fermion components. However, since the
system is constantly evolving, the cooling effect due to expansion will lead to
a decrease of the average parton energies. So the interactions should be
enhanced by a corresponding increase of the running coupling. We show that this
leads to a faster and improved equilibration. This improvement is more
important for the fermions compensating partially for their weaker interactions
and slower equilibration.

bodies, after velocity changes, cannot be detected by observers moving with
them because bodies and stationary radiations change in identical proportion
after identical circumstances, i.e, because bodies and stationary radiations
have identical relativistic laws with respect to any fixed observer.
Effectively the theoretical properties of particle models made up of stationary
radiations agree with special relativity, quantum mechanics and the
gravitational (G) tests. They fix lineal properties for all of them: the G
fields, the black holes (BHs) and the universe. The BHs, after absorbing
radiation, must return to the gas state. An eventual universe expansion cannot
change any relative distance because the G expansion of matter occurs in
identical proportion. This fixes a new kind of universe. In it matter evolves
in closed cycles, between gas and BH states and vice versa, indefinitely.
Galaxies and clusters must evolve rather cyclically between luminous and black
states. Most of the G potential energy of a matter cycle must be released
around neutron star and black hole boundaries. Nuclear stripping reactions
would transform G energy into nuclear and kinetic energies. This accounts for
many non well explained phenomena in astrophysics. This work has been
published, in more detail, in a book.
