resolution along the major and minor axes of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. The
spectral ranges analyzed are in the region of the stellar MgIb (5175 A), the
near IR CaII triplet (8550 A) absorption features, and the region of the Halpha
emission line. We have compared the shape of the stellar features with those of
reference stars and determined the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD)
of the stellar component by using a two-dimensional Gaussian decomposition
algorithm, and show for the first time the rotation curve of the stellar
component in NGC 253. Comparing the recesion velocity curves of the gas and
stars, it is seen that the stellar component has a decoupled kinematics respect
to the gas, displaying a shollower velocity gradient and larger velocity
dispersion that the gas in the inner regions. The minor axis kinematics
together with the kinematics across the central 40$''$ along the major axis,
suggest the presence of a rotating body with a kinematically misaligned axis
respect to the main disk of the galaxy. The asymmetries in the LOSVD along the
minor axis together with the steep velocity gradient of the gaseous component
suggest a merger scenario to explain the these kinematically signatures. The
enclosed mass in the central regions is computed to be (2.4+-0.5) 10^7$ Mo for
a radius of r=0.7'' (10 pc). A double gaseous component in the central 6
arcsecs is detected from the [SIII] lambda 9069 A data along the minor axis;
this seems to be the signature of a superbubble due to a supernova rate of 0.05

explore the extent to which it is capable of handling feature structure

show that LFG linguistic analyses can be expressed as clearly and perspicuously

Cauchy horizon, where the affine parameter normalization is determined by
parallel transport along a fixed, transverse null geodesic which intersects the
Cauchy horizon. (By contrast, the geometric feature of such spacetimes which
underlies classical blueshift instabilities is the divergence of a holonomy
operator). We show that the instability can be understood as a ``delayed
blueshift'' instability, which arises from the infinite blueshifting of an
energy flux which is created locally and quantum mechanically. The instability
mechanism applies both to chronology horizons in spacetimes with closed
timelike curves, and to the inner horizon in black hole spacetimes like two
dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter.

interaction is given. The microscopic foundation of these models, which appear
as a consequence of the composite quark structure of nucleons, is discussed.
M-type models are shown to arise naturally in a coupled channel approach when
compound or bag-like six-quark states, strongly coupled to the NN channel, are
eliminated from the complete multiquark wave function. The role of the
deep-lying bound states that appear in these models is elucidated. By
introducing additional conditions of orthogonality to these compound six-quark
states, a continuous series of almost on-shell equivalent nonlocal interaction
models, characterized by a strong reduction or full absence of a local
repulsive core (M-type models), is generated. The predictions of these
interaction models for 3N systems are analyzed in detail. It is shown that
M-type models give, under certain conditions, a stronger binding of the 3N
system than the original phase-equivalent model with nodeless wave functions.
An analysis of the 3N system with the new versions of the Moscow NN potential
describing also the higher even partial waves is presented. Large deviations
from conventional NN force models are found for the momentum distribution in
the high momentum region. In particular, the Coulomb displacement energy for
nuclei ^3He - ^3H displays a promising agreement with experiment when the ^3H
binding energy is extrapolated to the experimental value.

popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist
coverage greater than the stated confidence) in the Gaussian case and reduce it
to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the
method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino
oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is
powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino
oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.
