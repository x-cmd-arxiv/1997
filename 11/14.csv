  Also available from http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~omar/astro.html",,"10.1002/asna.2123190125",,"astro-ph",,"  We summarise our recent work on the faint galaxy contribution to the cosmic
X-ray background (XRB). At bright X-ray fluxes (in the ROSAT pass band), broad
line QSOs dominate the X-ray source population, but at fainter fluxes there is
evidence for a significant contribution from emission-line galaxies. Here we
present statistical evidence that these galaxies can account for a large
fraction of the XRB. We also demonstrate that these galaxies have significantly
harder X-ray spectra than QSOs. Finally we present preliminary findings from
infra-red spectroscopy on the nature of this X-ray emitting galaxy population.
We conclude that a hybrid explanation consisting of obscured/Type 2 AGN
surrounded by starburst activity can explain the properties of these galaxies
and perhaps the origin of the entire XRB.

component of gamma-ray burst spectra with data obtained by the Burst and
Transient Source Experiment. We have selected 126 high fluence and high flux
bursts from the beginning of the mission up until the present. Much of the data
were obtained with the Large Area Detectors, which have nearly all-sky
coverage, excellent sensitivity over two decades of energy and moderate energy
resolution, ideal for continuum spectra studies of a large sample of bursts at
high time resolution. At least 8 spectra from each burst were fitted with a
spectral form that consisted of a low-energy power law, a spectral break at
middle energies and a high-energy continuum. In most bursts (122), the
high-energy continuum was consistent with a power law. The evolution of the
fitted high-energy power-law index over the selected spectra for each burst is
inconsistent with a constant for 34% of the total sample. The sample
distribution of the average value for the index from each burst is fairly
narrow, centered on -2.12. A linear trend in time is ruled out for only 20% of
the bursts, with hard-to-soft evolution dominating the sample (100 events). The
distribution for the total change in the power-law index over the duration of a
burst peaks at the value -0.37, and is characterized by a median absolute
deviation of 0.39, arguing that a single physical process is involved. We
present analyses of the correlation of the power-law index with time, burst
intensity and low-energy time evolution. In general, we confirm the general
hard-to-soft spectral evolution observed in the low-energy component of the
continuum, while presenting evidence that this evolution is different in nature
from that of the rest of the continuum.

  1997. To appear in the ASP Conference Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The local stellar kinematics of the Milky Way, parameterized by the Oort
constants A and B, depend on the local gradient of the rotation curve, its
absolute value (Theta_0), and the distance to the Galactic center (R_0). The
surface density of interstellar gas in the Milky Way varies non-monotonically
with radius, and so contributes significantly to the local gradient of the
rotation curve, and the Oort constants. Because of this, the Oort functions
A(R) and B(R) differ significantly from the dominant ~Theta_0/R dependence, in
the Solar neighborhood and other locations in the Galaxy. These models may
explain the ~40% difference between the values for 2 A R_0 derived from radial
velocity data originating in the inner and outer Galaxy (Merrifield 1992).
Incorporating these local non-linearities explains the significant differences
between the Oort constants derived from nearby stars (d <= 1 kpc; Hanson 1987)
and distant Cepheids (d=0.5-6 kpc; Feast & Whitelock 1997). However, a
consistent picture only emerges if one adopts small values for the Galactic
constants: R_0 = 7.1 +/- 0.4 kpc, and Theta_0 = 184 +/- 8 km/s. These values
are consistent with most kinematical methods of determining R_0, including the
proper motion of Sgr A* (Backer 1996), the direct determination of R_0 using
water masers (7.2 +/- 0.7 kpc; Reid 1993), and constraints set by the shape of
the Milky Way's dark halo (Olling & Merrifield 1997b).

densities -- whose fluctuation correlations yield the diffusive mode
independently of the other modes so that the corresponding power spectrum
provides a measure of diffusion dynamics solely. Automaton simulations are
performed to obtain measurements of the spectral density over the complete
range of wavelengths (from the microscopic scale to the macroscopic scale of
the automaton universe). Comparison of the theoretical results with the
numerical experiments data yields the following results: (i) the spectral
functions of the lattice gas fluctuations are in accordance with those of a
classical `non-thermal' fluid; (ii) the Landau-Placzek theory, obtained as the
hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann theory, describes the spectra correctly in
the long wavelength limit; (iii) at shorter wavelengths and at moderate
densities the complete Boltzmann theory provides good agreement with the

  the proceedings of Cargese summer school on physics of dry granular media,
  NATO Advanced Study Institute",,,,"cond-mat",,"  Stress patterns in static granular media exhibit unusual features when
compared to either liquids or elastic solids. Qualitatively, we attribute these
features to the presence of `stress paths', whose geometry depends on the
construction history and controls the propagation of stresses. Stress paths can
cause random focussing of stresses (large fluctuations) as well as systematic
deflections (arching). We describe simple physical models that capture some of
these effects. In these models, the `stress paths' become identified with the
characteristic `light rays' of wavelike (hyperbolic) equations for force
propagation. Such models account for the `pressure dip' below conical sandpiles
built by pouring from a point source, and explain qualitatively the large
stress fluctuations observed experimentally in granular matter. The differences
between this approach and more conventional modelling strategies (based on
elastoplastic or rigid-plastic models) are highlighted, focusing on the role of
boundary conditions. Our models provide a continuum picture in which granular
materials are viewed as fragile matter, able to support without rearranging
only a subset of the static external loadings admissible for a normal elastic
solid.

The average thrust of the final states X, which emerge from the dissociation of

and implies a dominant 2-jet topology. Thrust is found to decrease with growing
Pt, the thrust jet momentum transverse to the photon-proton collision axis.
Distributions of Pt2 are consistent with being independent of MX. They show a
strong alignment of the thrust axis with the photon-proton collision axis, and
have a large high-Pt tail. The correlation of thrust with MX is similar to that
in e+e- annihilation at sqrt(see)=MX, but with lower values of thrust in the ep
data. The data cannot be described by interpreting the dissociated system X as
a qqbar state but inclusion of a substantial fraction of qqbarg parton

extension of the classical Maxwell's equations is to have a reliable
field-theoretical approach in describing (3+1) soliton-like electromagnetic
formations, in particular, to build an extended and finite field model of free
photons and photon complexes. The first chapter gives a corresponding analysis
of Maxwell theory and introduces the new equations. The second chapter gives a
full account of the results, including the photon-like solutions, in the vacuum
case. A new concept, called scale factor, is defined and successfully used. Two
ways for describing the intrinsic angular momentum are given. Interference of
two photon-like solutions is also considered. The third chapter considers
interaction with external fields (continuous media) on the base of establishing
correspondence between the physical concept of nondissipation and the
mathematical concept of integrability of Pfaff systems. A large family of
solutions is found, allowing a (3+1) interpretation of all known (1+1) soliton

independent 1D sequential FFTs on the rows and columns of this matrix. We can
attain almost perfect speedup in SSF for small numbers of processors depending
on both problem size and communication contention. The parallel algorithm is
applicable to other computational problems constrained by the speed of the 1D
FFT.

respectively. As a result we obtain the characters for the degeneracy of the
spectrum in terms of an alternating sum of skew Schur functions. Also studied
are new combinatorial descriptions (spectral decomposition) of the Kostka

the standard Hopf (super)algebras ${\cal H}_q$ that are the building blocks of

construct coloured Hopf duals ${\cal H}^{c*}$, endowed with coloured algebra
and antipode maps, but with a standard coalgebraic structure. Next, we review
the case where the ${\cal H}_q$'s are quantum universal enveloping algebras of
Lie (super)algebras $U_q(g)$, so that the corresponding ${\cal H}_q^*$'s are
quantum (super)groups $G_q$. We extend the Fronsdal and Galindo universal
${\cal T}$-matrix formalism to the coloured pairs $(U^c(g), G^c)$ by defining
coloured universal ${\cal T}$-matrices. We then show that together with the
coloured universal $\cal R$-matrices previously introduced, the latter provide
an algebraic formulation of the coloured RTT-relations, proposed by
Basu-Mallick. This establishes a link between the coloured extensions of
Drinfeld-Jimbo and Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan pictures of quantum groups and

giving some explicit results for the two-parameter deformations of

the stability group of the action of the group of local rotations on any point

source within this medium and observed at some distance away from the location
of the source. The aim is to find a velocity which describes a causal process
and is thus, for a medium with relativistic dispersion, limited by the velocity
of light. The wave function consists of a broad frequency forerunner generated
by the onset of the source, and of a monochromatic front which carries the
oscillation frequency of the source. For a medium with Schr\""{o}dinger-like
dispersion the monochromatic front propagates with a velocity which is in
agreement with the traversal time, and in the relativistic case the velocity of
the fronts is limited by the velocity of light. For sources with a sharp onset,
the forerunners are not attenuated and in magnitude far exceed the
monochromatic front. In contrast, for sources which are frequency-band limited,
the forerunners are also attenuated and become comparable to the monochromatic
front: like in the propagating case, there exists a time at which a broad
frequency forerunner is augmented by a monochromatic wave.
