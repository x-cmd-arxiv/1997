the SN illuminated a ring-like structure in the circumstellar material at about
0.65 ly from the SN. The interaction between the stellar winds from the SN
progenitor is considered to be the candidate for the formation of the
circumstellar structure. In the case that the stellar winds are spherically
symmetric, the interaction should result in a shell-like structure. However, in
this paper we show that the magnetic field in the winds causes an anisotropy
which leads to the formation of a ring-like structure. When the fast wind of
the blue supergiant phase of the progenitor sweeps up the surrounding slow wind
of the red-supergiant phase, the magnetic field as well as the wind material
are piled up in the interaction region. Since the magnetic energy increases in
proportion to the square of the amplitude, the magnetic field exhibits its
effect prominently at the interaction region; due to the magnetic pressure
force the material at lower latitudes is compressed into a ring-like structure.
It is suggested that this magnetic process can also explain the newly observed
pair of rings of the SN 1987A nebula.

solar masses; 2) the r-process demands a dominant robust mechanism at least for
barium and above, since the relative abundance pattern of those r-process

stars of about 8-10 solar masses produce nearly identical degenerate O/Ne/Mg

cores may produce both an r-process in a prompt explosion and a subsequent
r-process in a neutrino driven wind. The prompt explosion of an O/Ne/Mg core
yields low entropy and low electron fraction, and hence may produce a
reasonable r-process peak at A about 190 as well as all of the r-process

with a sample of discrete kinematic data. The comparison has two stages: (i)
finding the optimum scaling and orientation of the model relative to the data;
and (ii) calculating a goodness of fit, and hence assessing the plausibility of
the model in vew of the data. The method derives from considering the data and
model both as samples from some underlying binned distribution function, and
applying probability theory arguments. As an example, I consider a published
N-body model for the Galactic bulge and disc, and fictitious l,b,v
measurements, and recover (with error estimates) the spatial and velocity
scales of the model and the orientation of the bar. The fictitious data are
actually derived from the model by assuming the mass scale and the solar
position, but their size and extent mimics a recent survey of OH/IR stars. The
results indicate that mass of the bulge and our viewing angle of the bar are
usefully estimable from current surveys.

signatures of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability (eg. Hardee 1987). We
investigate the KH instability of a hydrodynamic jet composed of a relativistic
gas, surrounded by a nonrelativistic external medium and moving with a
relativistic bulk speed. We show basic nonlinear effects, which become
important for a finite amplitude KH modes. Since the KH instability in
supersonic jets involves acoustic waves over-reflected on jet boundaries, the
basic nonlinear effect relies on the steepening of the acoustic wave fronts,
leading to the formation of shocks. It turns our that the shocks appear
predominantly in the external nonrelativistic gas, while the internal acoustic
waves remain linear for a much longer time. In addition, the external medium
""hardens"" as soon as the boundary oscillation velocity becomes comparable to
the external sound speed. On the other hand, the amplification of internal
waves due to the over-reflection is limited by a nonlinearity of the Lorentz
$\gamma$ factor. This implies that the sidereal oscillations of the jet
boundary, resulting from the K-H instability, are limited to very small
amplitudes comparable to a fraction of the jet radius.

situation in glasses. The theory explicitly takes into account the distribution
of cluster reorientation frequencies and the effect of cluster-cluster

local field distribution function. The dielectric constant is obtained from an
integral master equation for the polarization dynamics in the presence of a
time dependent electric field. The theory is applied for the analysis of the
shape of the frequency dependent permittivity in the typical relaxor
ferrolectrics $PST$ as a function of temperature. The comparison of the theory

finite size scaling of the linear resistivity we find the dynamical critical
