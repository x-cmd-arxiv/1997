compare the consistency of the tail-inferred (from clusters) and measured
values (from large-scale flows) of the rms level of mass fluctuations for two
distribution functions: a Gaussian, and a texture (positively-skewed) PDF.
Averaging the recent large-scale flow measurements, we find that observations
of the rms and the tail at the 10 h^-1 Mpc scale disfavor a texture PDF at ~1.5
sigma in all cases. However, taking only the most recent measurement of the
rms, that from Willick et al. (1997b), the comparison disfavors textures for
low Omega_0=0.3, and disfavors Gaussian models if Omega_0=1 (again at ~1.5
sigma). Predictions for evolution of high temperature clusters can also be made
for the models considered, and strongly disfavor Omega_0=1 in Gaussian models
and marginally disfavor Omega_0=1 in texture models. Only Omega_0=0.3 Gaussian

diagram of Lauer & Postman (1992). This BCG Hubble diagram contains 114
galaxies covering the full celestial sphere and is volume limited to 15,000
km/s, providing excellent sampling of the far field Hubble flow. The SBF zero
point is based on the Cepheid calibration of the ground I_KC method (Tonry et
al. 1997) as extended to the WFPC2 F814W filter by Ajhar et al. (1997). The BCG
globular cluster luminosity functions give distances essentially identical to
the SBF results. Using the velocities and SBF distances of the four BCG alone
gives H_0 = 82 +/- 8 km/s/Mpc in the CMB frame, valid on ~4,500 km/s scales.
Use of BCG as photometric redshift estimators allows the BCG Hubble diagram to
be calibrated independently of recession velocities, yielding a far field H_0 =
89 +/- 10 km/s/Mpc with an effective depth of ~11,000 km/s. The error in this
case is dominated by the photometric cosmic scatter in using BCG as distance
estimators. The concordance of the present results with other recent H_0
determinations, and a review of theoretical treatments on perturbations in the
near field Hubble flow, argue that going to the far field removes an important
source of uncertainty, but that there is not a large systematic error to be
corrected for to begin with. Further improvements in H_0 depend more on
understanding nearby calibrators than on improved sampling of the distant flow.

reionized at some redshift $z>5$. If a source of radiation could be observed at
the rest-frame Lya wavelength, at a sufficiently high redshift where some of
the IGM in the line-of-sight was not yet reionized, the Gunn-Peterson trough
should be present. Longward of the Lya wavelength, a damping wing should be
observed caused by the neutral IGM whose absorption profile can be predicted.
Measuring the shape of this damping wing would provide irrefutable evidence of
the observation of the IGM before reionization, and a determination of the
density of the neutral IGM. This measurement might be hindered by the possible
presence of a dense absorption system associated with the source.
  Shortward of the \lya wavelength, absorption should be seen from the patchy
structure of the IGM in the process of reionization. We show that a complete
Gunn-Peterson trough is most likely to continue to be observed through the
epoch where the IGM is partially ionized. The damping wings of the neutral
patches should overlap if the proper pathlength through an ionized region is
less than 1 h^{-1} Mpc; even in larger ionized regions, the characteristic
background intensity should be low enough to yield a very high optical depth
due to the residual neutral fraction, although occasionally some flux may be
transmitted through large, underdense voids within an ionized region. The case
of the HeII reionization is also discussed, and we argue that helium was
already doubly ionized by z=3 throughout the IGM.
  The recently discovered afterglows of gamma-ray bursts might soon be observed
at very high redshifts. Their featureless continuum spectrum and high
luminosities make them ideal sources for studying absorption by the IGM.

of radiative transfer describing the interaction of low energy photons with a
Maxwellian distribution of hot electrons in gravitational field of a
Schwarzschild black hole. We prove that due to Comptonization an initial
arbitrary spectrum of low energy photons unavoidably results in spectra
characterized by an extended power-law feature. We examine the spectral index
by using both analytical and numerical methods for a variety of physical
parameters as such the plasma temperature and the mass accretion rate. The
presence of the event horizon as well as the behaviour of the null geodesics in
its vicinity largely determine the dependence of the spectral index on the flow
parameters. We come to the conclusion that the bulk motion of a converging flow
is more efficient in upscattering photons than thermal Comptonization provided
that the electron temperature in the flow is of order of a few keV or less. In
this case, the spectrum observed at infinity consists of a soft component
produced by those input photons that escape after a few scatterings without any
significant energy change and of hard component (described by a power law)
produced by the photons that underwent significant upscattering. The luminosity
of the power-law component is relatively small compared to that of the soft
component. For accretion into black hole the spectral energy index of the
power-law is always higher than one for plasma temperature of order of a few
keV. This result suggests that the bulk motion Comptonization might be
responsible for the power-law spectra seen in the black-hole X-ray sources.

excess emission at 10 $\mu$m consistent with predictions based on circumstellar

with an active accretion disk and DI Tau is a binary system lacking such a
disk. The companion to DI Tau has a very low luminosity and is located at a

$0.04\hr<k<0.1\hr$. Over this range of wavenumbers, the APM cluster power
spectrum has the same shape as the power spectra measured for optical and IRAS
galaxies. This is consistent with a simple linear bias model in which different
tracers have the same power spectrum as that of the mass distribution but
shifted in amplitude by a constant biasing factor. On larger scales, the power
spectrum of APM clusters flattens and appears to turn over on a scale $k \sim
0.03\hmpcrev$. We compare the power spectra estimated from simulated APM
cluster catalogues to those estimated directly from cubical N-body simulation
volumes and find that the APM cluster survey should give reliable estimates of
the true power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \simgt 0.02\hmpcrev$. These results
suggest that the observed turn-over in the power spectrum may be a real feature
of the cluster distribution and that we have detected the transition to a near
scale-invariant power spectrum implied by observations of anisotropies in the
cosmic microwave background radiation. The scale of the turn-over in the
cluster power spectrum is in good agreement with the scale of the turn-over
observed in the power spectrum of APM galaxies.

expansions for one-parameter families (not necessarily groups) of
diffeomorphisms. First, we introduce the notion of knight diffeomorphism, that
generalises the usual concept of flow, and prove a Taylor's formula for the
action of a knight on a general tensor field. Then, we show that any
one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms can be approximated by a family of
suitable knights. Since in perturbation theory the gauge freedom is given by a
one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, the expansion of knights is used to
derive our transformation formula. The problem of gauge dependence is a purely
kinematical one, therefore our treatment is valid not only in general
relativity, but in any spacetime theory.

Universe are probably responsible for the observed large-scale cosmological
perturbations. The comparison of the theory with the detected microwave
background anisotropies favors the conclusion that the very early Universe was
not driven by a scalar field with whichever scalar field potential. At the same
time, the observations allow us to conclude that there is a good probability of
a direct detection of the higher frequency relic gravitational waves with the

collection efficiencies (cce) of the detector are reduced due to the reduction
in the electron and hole mean free paths. Pion and proton irradiations produce
a greater reduction in cce than neutron irradiation with the pions having the
greatest effect. The effect of annealing the detectors at room temperature, at

flash-lamp anneal produced the greatest increase in the cce from 26% to 70% by
increasing the mean free path of the electrons. Two indium-doped samples were
irradiated with 24GeV/c protons and demonstrated no improvement over SI U GaAs

A57 (1998) 4122","10.1103/PhysRevA.57.4122",,"quant-ph",,"  A general method for extending a non-dissipative nonlinear Schr\""odinger and
Liouville-von Neumann 1-particle dynamics to an arbitrary number of particles
is described. It is shown at a general level that the dynamics so obtained is
completely separable, which is the strongest condition one can impose on
dynamics of composite systems. It requires that for all initial states
(entangled or not) a subsystem not only cannot be influenced by any action
undertaken by an observer in a separated system (strong separability), but
additionally that the self-consistency condition $Tr_2\circ
\phi^t_{1+2}=\phi^t_{1}\circ Tr_2$ is fulfilled. It is shown that a correct
extension to $N$ particles involves integro-differential equations which, in
spite of their nonlocal appearance, make the theory fully local. As a
consequence a much larger class of nonlinearities satisfying the complete
separability condition is allowed than has been assumed so far. In particular
all nonlinearities of the form $F(|\psi(x)|)$ are acceptable. This shows that
the locality condition does not single out logarithmic or 1-homeogeneous
nonlinearities.

3-dimensional purely quantum integrable systems (the 1-dimensional counterpart
is the Lame equation). That is, we have an integrable potential whose amplitude
is not free but rather proportional to $\hbar^2$, and in the classical limit
the potential vanishes. Furthermore it turns out that some of these systems
actually have N+1 commuting differential operators, connected by a nontrivial
algebraic relation. Some of them have been discussed recently by A.P. Veselov
