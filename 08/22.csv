quantum mechanically. Trace formulas establish links between the energy spectra
of the quantum description and the spectrum of actions of periodic orbits in
the classical description. This duality is investigated in the present paper.
The duality holds for chaotic as well as for integrable systems. For billiards
the quantal spectrum (eigenvalues of the Helmholtz equation) and the classical
spectrum (lengths of periodic orbits) are two manifestations of the billiard's
boundary. The trace formula expresses this link as a Fourier transform relation
between the corresponding spectral densities. It follows that the two-point
statistics are also simply related. The universal correlations of the quantal
spectrum are well known, consequently one can deduce the classical universal
correlations. An explicit expression for the scale of the classical
correlations is derived and interpreted. This allows a further extension of the
formalism to the case of complex billiard systems, and in particular to the
most interesting case of diffusive system. The concept of classical
correlations allows a better understanding of the so-called diagonal
approximation and its breakdown. It also paves the way towards a semiclassical
theory that is capable of global description of spectral statistics beyond the
breaktime. An illustrative application is the derivation of the
disorder-limited breaktime in case of a disordered chain, thus obtaining a
semiclassical theory for localization. A numerical study of classical
correlations in the case of the 3D Sinai billiard is presented. We gain a
direct understanding of specific statistical properties of the classical
spectrum, as well as their semiclassical manifestation in the quantal spectrum.

observed from energetic considerations and Rayleigh clarified through

tension. In traditional descriptions of this instability it occurs everywhere
along the cylinder at once, triggered by infinitesimal perturbations. Here we
explore in detail a recently conjectured alternate scenario for this
instability: front propagation. Using boundary integral techniques for Stokes
flow, we provide numerical evidence that the viscous Rayleigh instability can
indeed spread behind a front moving at constant velocity, in some cases leading
to a periodic sequence of pinching events. These basic results are in
quantitative agreement with the marginal stability criterion, yet there are
important qualitative differences associated with the discontinuous nature of

polarization echo. Here, the attenuation of these echo amplitudes as a function
of evolution time is presented for cymantrene and ferrocene polycrystalline
samples, involving one and two five spin rings per molecule respectively. We
calculate the fraction of polarization which is not refocused because only the
secular part of the dipolar Hamiltonian is inverted. The results indicate that,
as long as the spin dynamics is restricted to a single ring, the non-inverted
part of the Hamiltonian is notable by itself to explain the whole decay of the
polarization echoes. A cross over from exponential (cymantrene) to Gaussian
(ferrocene) attenuation is experimentally observed. This is attributed to an
increase of the relative importance of the spin dynamics, as compared with
irreversible interactions, which favors dynamical irreversibility.

  Phys",,"10.1063/1.475021",,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft",,"  Simulations on a Lennard-Jones computer glass are performed to study effects
arising from defects in glasses at low temperatures. The numerical analysis
reveals that already a low concentration of defects may dramatically change the
low temperature properties by giving rise to extrinsic double-well potentials
(DWP's). The main characteristics of these extrinsic DWP's are (i) high barrier
heights, (ii) high probability that a defect is indeed connected with an
extrinsic DWP, (iii) highly localized dynamics around this defect, and (iv)
smaller deformation potential coupling to phonons. Designing an extension of
the Standard Tunneling Model (STM) which parametrizes this picture and
comparing with ultrasound experiments on the wet network glass $a$-B$_2$O$_3$
shows that effects of OH-impurities are accurately accounted for. This model is
then applied to organic polymer glasses and proteins. It is suggested that side
groups may act similarly like doped impurities inasmuch as extrinsic DWP's are
induced, which possess a distribution of barriers peaked around a high barrier
height. This compares with the structurlessly distributed barrier heights of
the intrinsic DWP's, which are associated with the backbone dynamics. It is
shown that this picture is consistent with elastic measurements on polymers,
and can explain anomalous nonlogarithmic line broadening recently observed in
hole burning experiments in PMMA.

weak decays of light hypernuclei. The $\Lambda N \to NN$ transition is
described by the one pion exchange mechanism and the direct quark mechanism,
induced by the four-quark vertices in the effective weak Hamiltonian. By
employing a realistic wave function of the $\Lambda$ inside the hypernuclei,
nonmesonic decay rates of $^4_{\Lambda}$H, $^4_{\Lambda}$He, and
$^5_{\Lambda}$He are calculated. The results show that the direct quark
mechanism is significantly large and gives a large $\Delta I =3/2$ contribution
in the J=0 channel. The relative phase between the one-pion exchange and the
direct-quark contributions is determined so that the effective weak Hamiltonian
for quarks give both of them consistently. We find that the sum of these two
contributions reproduce the current available experimental data fairly well.

electrostatic plasma waves corresponding to four-dimensional systems of mode
amplitude equations. In each case the coupled amplitude equations are derived
up to third order terms. The nonlinear coefficients are singular in the limit
in which the linear growth rates vanish together. These singularities are
analyzed using techniques developed in previous studies of a single unstable
wave. In addition to the singularities familiar from the one mode problem,
there are new singularities in coefficients coupling the modes. The new
singularities are most severe when the two waves have the same linear phase
velocity and satisfy the spatial resonance condition $k_2=2k_1$. As a result
the short wave mode saturates at a dramatically smaller amplitude than that
predicted for the weak growth rate regime on the basis of single mode theory.
In contrast the long wave mode retains the single mode scaling. If these
resonance conditions are not satisfied both modes retain their single mode
scaling and saturate at comparable amplitudes.

quasitriangular Hopf algebra \D(\G), the quantum double of \G. Based on the
construction of a so--called diagonal crossed product developed by the authors,
we generalize this result to the case of quasi--Hopf algebras \G. As for
ordinary Hopf algebras, as a vector space the ``quasi--quantum double'' \D(\G)
is isomorphic to the tensor product of \G and its dual \dG. We give explicit
formulas for the product, the coproduct, the R--matrix and the antipode on
\D(\G) and prove that they fulfill Drinfeld's axioms of a quasitriangular
quasi--Hopf algebra. In particular \D(\G) becomes an associative algebra
containing \G as a quasi--Hopf subalgebra. On the other hand, \dG \otimes 1 is
not a subalgebra of \D(\G) unless the coproduct on \G is strictly
coassociative. It is shown that the category of finite dimensional
representations of \D(\G) coincides with what has been called the double
category of \G--modules by S. Majid [M2]. Thus our construction gives a
concrete realization of Majid's abstract definition of quasi--quantum doubles
in terms of a Tannaka--Krein--like reconstruction procedure. The whole
construction is shown to generalize to weak quasi--Hopf algebras with \D(\G)
now being linearly isomorphic to a subspace of \dG \otimes \G.
