  cosmological model analyzed. Accepted for ApJ",,"10.1086/305622",,"astro-ph",,"  We develop a prescription for characterizing the strengths of metal lines
associated with Lyman-alpha forest absorbers (LYFAs) of a given neutral
hydrogen column density N_HI and metallicity [Fe/H]. This Line Observability
Index (LOX) is line-specific and translates, for weak lines, into a measure of
the equivalent width. It can be evaluated quickly for thousands of transitions
within the framework of a given model of the Lyman-alpha forest, providing a
ranking of the lines in terms of their strengths and enabling model builders to
select the lines that should be detectable in observed spectra of a given
resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We compute the LOX for a large number of
elements and transitions in two cosmological models of the Lyman-alpha forest
at z=3 derived from a hydrodynamic simulation of structure formation, and we
discuss how the LOX depends on redshift and on model parameters such as the
mean baryonic density and radiation field. We find that the OVI (1032,1038)
doublet is the best probe of the metallicity in low column density LYFAs N_{HI}
\approx 10^{14.5} cm^{-2}). Metallicities down to [O/H] \sim -3 ([Fe/H] \sim
-3.5 with the assumed [O/Fe] ratio) yield OVI absorption features that should
be detectable in current high-quality spectra, provided that the expected
position of the OVI feature is not contaminated by HI absorption. The strongest
transitions in lower ionisation states of oxygen are OV(630), OIV(788), and
OIII(833), and are likely to be detected with next generation UV instruments.
Of the lines with rest wavelengths \lambda_r > 1216, which can potentially be
observed redwards of the \lya forest, the CIV(1548,1551) doublet is expected to
dominate in all LYFAs, regardless of the value of N_HI.

(HB) morphology, with clear indications of a bimodal HB and a ``gap"" on the
blue HB. In this paper, we present extensive synthetic HB simulations to
determine whether peculiar distributions in the underlying physical parameters
are needed to explain the observed HB morphology. We find that a unimodal mass
distribution along the HB can satisfactorily account for the observed HB
bimodality, *provided* the mass dispersion is substantially larger than usually
inferred for the Galactic globular clusters. In this case, NGC 6229 should have
a well-populated, extended blue tail. A truly bimodal distribution in HB masses
can also satisfactorily account for the observed HB morphology, although in
this case the existence of an extended blue tail is not necessarily implied.
The other two well-known bimodal-HB clusters, NGC 1851 and NGC 2808, are
briefly analyzed. While the HB morphology of NGC 1851 can also be reproduced
with a unimodal mass distribution assuming a large mass dispersion, the same is
not true of NGC 2808, for which a bimodal, and possibly multimodal, mass
distribution seems definitely required.
  The problem of gaps on the blue HB is also discussed. Applying the standard
Hawarden (1971) and Newell (1973) chi-squared test, we find that the NGC 6229
gap is significant at the 99.7% level. However, in a set of 1,000 simulations,
blue-HB gaps comparable to the observed one are present in ~ 6 - 9% of all
cases. We employ a new and simple formalism, based on the binomial
distribution, to explain the origin of this discrepancy, and conclude that
Hawarden's method, in general, substantially overestimates the statistical
significance of gaps.

the same class of power-law spherical models for the halo of MHOs studied in a
previous paper (astro-ph/9609187). Whereas the duration-based error in the
average MHO mass, \mu exceeds (at N=100 events) \mu by a factor of 2 or more,
parallax microlensing remarkably brings it down to 15-20% of \mu, regardless of
the shape of the mass function. In addition, the slope \alpha of the mass

(\sigma_{\alpha} < 0.4) for a broader range, -3 <\alpha < 0. The improvement in
the inference of the halo structure is also significant: the index \gamma of

under typical atmospheric seeing condition at 2.2 micron. Therefore, the
spectrograph entrance slit size should match the 0.2 arcsec image to obtain
high throughput. Higher resolution can be achieved by narrowing down the slit
size to match the diffraction-limited image core size of about 0.1 arcsec in
the infrared. However, the throughput will be correspondingly reduced by a
factor of two. Due to the limited atmospheric isoplanatic angle in the J, H and
K bands, the encircled photon percentage within 0.2 arcsec diameter drops from
40-60% when the object is at the laser pointing direction to 20-40% when the
object is about 30 arcsec away from the laser direction. Therefore, the useful
field of view for AO multiple object spectroscopy is about 60 arcsec. Further

of variability, all spectral changes can be attributed to the rapid
disappearing of the inner region of an accretion disk, followed by a slower
re-filling of the emptied region. The time scale for each event is determined
by the extent of the missing part of the disk. The observed relation between
the duration of an event and the radius of the disappearing region matches
remarkably well the expected radius dependence of the viscous time scale for
the radiation-pressure dominated region of an accretion disk.

  and Ellen F. Prince, Oxford University Press, 1997",,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  Centering was formulated as a model of the relationship between attentional
state, the form of referring expressions, and the coherence of an utterance
within a discourse segment (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein, 1986; Grosz, Joshi and
Weinstein, 1995). In this chapter, I argue that the restriction of centering to
operating within a discourse segment should be abandoned in order to integrate
centering with a model of global discourse structure. The within-segment
restriction causes three problems. The first problem is that centers are often
continued over discourse segment boundaries with pronominal referring
expressions whose form is identical to those that occur within a discourse
segment. The second problem is that recent work has shown that listeners
perceive segment boundaries at various levels of granularity. If centering
models a universal processing phenomenon, it is implausible that each listener
is using a different centering algorithm.The third issue is that even for
utterances within a discourse segment, there are strong contrasts between
utterances whose adjacent utterance within a segment is hierarchically recent
and those whose adjacent utterance within a segment is linearly recent. This
chapter argues that these problems can be eliminated by replacing Grosz and
Sidner's stack model of attentional state with an alternate model, the cache
model. I show how the cache model is easily integrated with the centering
algorithm, and provide several types of data from naturally occurring
discourses that support the proposed integrated model. Future work should
provide additional support for these claims with an examination of a larger
corpus of naturally occurring discourses.

the microwave conductivity, universal Raman slopes are sensitive not only to
the existence of a node, but also to different pairing states and should allow

range order (ii) particles flow along static channels (iii) the channel pattern

existence of the ``transverse critical force'' at T=0. A ``static random

in $d=3$ and algebraically in $d=2$. The persistence of quasi long range
translational order in $d=3$ at weak disorder, or large velocity leads to
predict a topologically ordered ``Moving Bragg Glass''. This state continues
the static Bragg glass and is stable at $T>0$, with non linear transverse
response and linear asymptotic behavior. In $d=2$, or in $d=3$ at intermediate

quasi order in the transverse direction. A phase diagram in $T$ force and

de-Haas van-Alphen oscillations in a pure type-II superconductor is
investigated within mean field,asymptotic perturbation theory. Using a 2D
electron gas model it is shown that, due to a strict phase coherence in the
many-particle correlation functions, the 'scattering' effect in the asymptotic
limit ($\sqrt{E_F/\hbar\omega_c}\gg 1$) is much weaker than what is predicted
by the random vortex lattice model proposed by Maki and Stephen, which destroys
this coherence . The coherent many particle configuration is a collinear array
of many particle coordinates, localized within a spatial region with size of
the order of the magnetic length. The amplitude of the magnetization
oscillations is sharply damped just below $% H_{c2}$ because of strong
$180^{\circ}$ out of phase magnetic oscillations in the superconducting
condensation energy ,which tend to cancel the normal electron oscillations.
Within the ideal 2D model used it is found, however, that because of the
relative smallness of the quartic and higher order terms in the expansion, the
oscillations amplitude at lower fields does not really damp to zero, but only
reverses sign and remains virtually undamped well below $H_{c2}$. This
conclusion may be changed if disorder in the vortex lattice, or vortex lines
motion will be taken into account. The reduced QP 'scattering' effect may be
responsible for the apparent crossover from a strong damping of the dHvA
oscillations just below $H_{c2}$ to a weaker damping at lower fields observed
experimentally in several 3D superconductors.

Agreement is found within 30 % of the two-loop result. In Supersymmetry, the
two-loop QCD corrections to the stop- and sbottom-loop contributions to the rho
parameter are presented. The two-loop corrections modify the one-loop
contribution by up to 30 %; the gluino decouples for large masses. Contrary to
the SM case where the QCD corrections are negative and screen the one-loop
value, the corresponding corrections in the supersymmetric case are in general
positive, increasing the sensitivity in the search for scalar quarks through
their virtual effects in high-precision electroweak observables.

noise level which can be tolerated in a fault-tolerant method is therefore a
function of the computational resources available, especially the size of
computer and degree of parallelism. I present an analysis of error correction
with block codes, made fault-tolerant through the use of prepared ancilla
blocks. The preparation and verification of the ancillas is described in
detail. It is shown that the ancillas need only be verified against a small set
of errors. This, combined with previously known advantages, makes this `ancilla
factory' the best method to apply error correction, whether in concatenated or
block coding. I then consider the resources required to achieve $2 \times
10^{10}$ computational steps reliably in a computer of 2150 logical qubits,
finding that the simplest $[[n,1,d]]$ block codes can tolerate more noise with
smaller overheads than the $7^L$-bit concatenated code. The scaling is such
that block codes remain the better choice for all computations one is likely to
contemplate.

information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to
summarise not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum
information theory. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics
fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, the review
begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer
science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines
and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then
outlined, and the EPR experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and
quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which
distinguishes quantum from classical information theory, and, arguably, quantum
from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are described,
including key distribution, teleportation, data compression, quantum error
correction, the universal quantum computer and quantum algorithms. The common
theme of all these ideas is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational
resource. Experimental methods for small quantum processors are briefly
sketched, concentrating on ion traps, high Q cavities, and NMR. The review
concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics,
and avenues for future research.
