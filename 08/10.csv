L149","10.1086/310925",,"astro-ph",,"  Spectral and kinematic studies suggest that the nonthermal radio source Sgr
A*, located at the center of the Milky Way, is a supermassive compact object
with a mass 2-3 million solar masses. Winds from nearby stars, located
approximately 0.06 pc to the east of Sgr A*, should, in the absence of any
outflow from the putative black hole itself, be accreting onto this object. We
report the results of the first 3D Bondi-Hoyle hydrodynamical numerical
simulations of this process under the assumption that the Galactic center wind
is generated by several different point sources (here assumed to be 10
pseudo-randomly placed stars). Our results show that the accretion rate onto
the central object can be higher than in the case of a uniform flow since
wind-wind shocks dissipate some of the bulk kinetic energy and lead to a higher
capture rate for the gas. However, even for this highly non-uniform medium,
most of the accreting gas carries with it a relatively low level of specific
angular momentum, though large transient fluctuations can occur. Additionally,
the post-bow-shock focusing of the gas can be substantially different than that
for a uniform flow, but it depends strongly on the stellar spatial
distribution. We discuss how this affects the morphology of the gas in the
inner 0.15 pc of the Galaxy and the consequences for accretion disk models of
Sgr A*.

electromagnetic to particle dominance in Poynting flux jets, formation of pair
cascades, synchrotron emission by cascading pairs, and formation of shocks due
to unsteadiness in the jet parameters are considered, with emphasis on the

bring new light into the discussion on the lack of phase separation in
colloidal mixtures of spheres and rods.

  Les Arcs, France","Proc. 32nd Moriond, QCD and Hadronic interactions, p. 485",,"WU B 97/16","hep-ph",,"  The uncertainty in the equilibration in heavy ion collisions due to the
choice of the value of the coupling is examined. The results of the
equilibration are indeed affected by this choice. In particular, a variation of
$\a_s$ from 0.3 to 0.5 reduces the parton phase of the plasma by as much as 4.0
fm/c and increasing coupling causes a reduction in the generated entropy. As
far as equilibration is concerned, larger coupling results in faster
equilibration both chemically and kinetically but improvements only happen to
the fermions. These are accompanied by more rapid cooling and therefore
shortened lifetime. In the light of these results, to choose $\a_s$ is almost
equivalent to choosing the results. Also because of consistency, any fixed
$\a_s$ is incompatible with an evolving plasma. The best choice is therefore
not to choose at all but let the system makes its own decision. We show a
simple recipe how this can be done. With an evolving coupling, equilibration is
accelerated with better results at the expense of the duration of the
deconfined phase.

classification (even subgroup $\bar {SL}(4,R)$) prverline {SL}(4,R)$) provides
for the most economical spontaneous breaking of $\bar{SL}(4,R)$ as gauge group,
leaving just local $\bar{SO}(1,3)$ unbroken. As a result, post-Riemannian SKY
gravity yields Einstein's theory as a low-energy (longer range) effective
