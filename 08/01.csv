delays have recently been measured. It turns out that the image positions and
the ratio of time delays between different pairs of images constrain the mass
distribution in a linear fashion. Since observational errors on image positions
and time delay ratios are constantly improving, we use these data as a rigid
constraint in our modelling. In addition, we require the projected mass
distributions to be inversion-symmetric and to have inward-pointing density
gradients. With these realistic yet non-restrictive conditions it is very easy
to produce mass distributions that fit the data precisely. We then present
models, for $H_0=42$, 63 and 84 \kmsmpc, that in each case minimize
mass-to-light variations while strictly obeying the lensing constraints. (Only
a very rough light distribution is available at present.) All three values of
$H_0$ are consistent with the lensing data, but require quite different
morphologies for the lensing galaxy. If $H_0$ is low, the main lensing galaxy
could be an early type. If $H_0$ is high, the galaxy is reconstructed as a late
elliptical or nearly edge-on disc; a binary or merging system is also
plausible.

  Astronomy & Astrophysics, e-mail:parravan@ciens.ula.ve",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The variation of an ionizing flux as a mechanism to stimulate the
condensation of a diffuse gas is considered. To illustrate this effect, two
situations are examined: one on the context of pregalactic conditions, and the
other on the context of the actual interstellar medium. We focus our attention
on flash-like variations; that is, during a ``short'' period of time the
ionizing flux is enhanced in comparison to the pre- and post-flash values. In
both cases the cause of the induced phase change is the same: the enhancement
of the cooling rate by the increase in the electron density caused by the
momentary increase of ionizing flux. After the passing of the flash, the
cooling rate remains enhanced due to the ``inertia of the ionization''. In the
first case (metal free gas) the cooling rate is enhanced due to the fact that
the increase of the electron density makes possible the gas phase formation of
H_2 by the creation of the intermediaries H^- and H^+_2. We show that after the
passing of the photo-ionizing flash a cloud near thermo-chemical equilibrium at
~8000 K may be induced to increase its H_2 content by many orders of magnitude,
causing a rapid decrease of its temperature to values as low as 100 K. In the
second case (solar abundances gas) the dominant cooling mechanism of the warm
neutral gas (the excitation of heavy ions by electron impacts) is proportional
to the electron density. We show that, for the expected states of the warm
interstellar gas, ionizing flashes may induce the phase transition from the
warm to the cool phase. The results indicate that the mechanism of induced
condensation studied here might play a relevant role in the gas evolution of
the diffuse gas in both, the pregalactic and the actual interstellar medium
conditions.

they have difficulty in reproducing the large decline down to the lower

XB1916-053, all levels of dipping can be fitted using kT_bb= 2.14+/-0.28 keV
and power law photon index = 2.42 +/-0.21. Dipping is shown to be due to large
increases of column density for the point-like blackbody, combined with the
extended power law component being progressively covered by absorber until in
the deepest parts of dips, the partial covering fraction approaches unity. This
approach differs radically from the ``absorbed plus unabsorbed'' approach
previously used in spectral modelling of XB1916-053 and similar sources, in
which the normalisation of the unabsorbed component is allowed to decrease
markedly in dipping, behavior generally attributed to the effects of electron
scattering. Thus we have shown that spectral evolution in XB1916-053 can be
explained simply in terms of photoelectric absorption without the need for
substantial electron scattering. This explanation is supported by calculation
of the relative importance of photoelectric absorption and electron scattering
in the absorbing region which shows that little electron scattering is expected

processes occurring at the electroweak transition cannot generate fields
stronger than $10^{-20}$ Gauss on a scale of 0.5 Mpc. However, it is
implausible that this upper bound could ever be reached, as it would require
all the energy in the Universe to be turned into a magnetic field coherent at

expected to form when the disc becomes sufficiently large in outburst so that
the tides induced by the secondary star can excite waves in the outer disc.
Such spiral waves have been predicted in studies of tidal effects in discs and
are fundamental in understanding the angular momentum budget of accretion

  Not yet reviewed",,,,"cond-mat",,"  Bloch wavefunctions are used to derive dispersion relations for water wave
propagation in the presence of an infinite array of periodically arranged
surface scatterers. For one dimensional periodicity (stripes), band gaps for
wavevectors in the direction of periodicity are found corresponding to multiple
Bragg scattering. The dependence of these band gaps as a function of scatterer
density, strength, and water depth is analyzed. We find in contrast to band gap
behavior in electronic, photonic, and acoustic systems, these gaps can increase
with excitation frequency $\omega$. Thus, higher order Bragg scattering can
play a dominant role in suppressing wave propagation. Furthermore, in one
dimension, an additional constraint (in addition to single scatterer energy and
momentum conservation) on the calculation of transmission $T$ and reflection
$R$ coefficients of a finite number of scatterers is calculated from the exact
dispersion relation of the infinite periodic system. This relationship may be
useful in measurements where only phase or amplitude is easily measured. In
simple two dimensional periodic geometries, we find no complete band gaps and
offer semi-quantitative reasons for why this is so. The role of evanescent
modes is discussed, and finally, equations for water wave band structure in the
presence of a uniform flow are derived.

universe during a first order electroweak phase transition. The mechanism
requires the existence of two (or more) baryon number carrying scalar fields
with masses and CP violating mixing which vary with the Higgs field expectation
value. This mechanism can be implemented using squarks in supersymmetric
theories or using leptoquarks. Our central observation is that reflection of
these scalars from a bubble wall can yield a significant net baryon number flux
into the symmetric phase, balanced by a flux of opposite sign into the broken
phase. For generic parameter choices, scalars with incident energies in a
specific, but not narrow, range yield order one reflection asymmetries (between
the probability of reflection of the scalars and of their antiparticles). The
interesting energies are those for which there are two propagating scalars in
the symmetric phase but only one in the broken phase. Electroweak sphaleron
processes drive the baryon number in the symmetric phase toward zero, but do

below ~ 1 TeV to avoid fine-tuning; in the second case, the breaking can take
place along a flat direction at an intermediate scale between the string scale

neutrinos are sensitive. There is one class of waves which may be subject to an

of U(1) charge assignment on various fields concerned in superpotential leads
to unique Yukawa coupling matrices with zero textures. Thirteen parameters

successfully predicted by only four parameters. The masses and mixing angles

sterile neutrino. An additional parameter is added to obtain the mass and

the effective parameters a_i that are linear combinations of Wilson
coefficients, or equivalently absorbed into the effective number of colors N_c.
Naive factorization with N_c=3 fails to explain the CLEO data of $B^\pm \to
\omega K^\pm$, showing the first evidence for the importance of nonfactorizable
contributions to the penguin amplitude. The decays $B^\pm \to \omega\pi^\pm$
dominated by tree amplitudes are sensitive to the interference between external
and internal W-emission diagrams. Destructive interference implied by
$N_c=\infty$ leads to a prediction of ${\cal B}(B^\pm \to \omega \pi^\pm)$
which is about $2\sigma$ too small compared to experiment. Therefore, the CLEO
data of $B^\pm \to \omega K^\pm, \omega\pi^\pm$ suffice to rule out N_c=3 and
strongly disfavor $N_c=\infty$ for rare charmless B decays. Factorization based
on $N_c\approx 2$ can accommodate the data of $B^\pm \to \omega K^\pm$, but it
predicts a slightly smaller branching ratio of $B^\pm \to \omega\pi^\pm$ with
${\cal B}(B^\pm \to \omega\pi^\pm)/{\cal B} (B^\pm \to \omega K^\pm)=0.6$. We
briefly explain why the 1/N_c expansion is still applicable to the B meson

K\""ahler space associated with the vector multiplets induce corresponding
transformations on the hypermultiplets. We construct the Sp(1)$\times$Sp($n$)
one-forms in terms of which the hypermultiplet couplings are encoded and
exhibit their behaviour under symplectic reparametrizations. Both vector and
hypermultiplet theories allow vectorial central charges in the supersymmetry
algebra associated with integrals over the K\""ahler and hyper-K\""ahler forms,
respectively. We show how these charges and the holomorphic BPS mass are
related by the mirror map.

Green-Schwarz superstring with ${\cal F}= 0$. We suggest that $E^1$ (canonical
conjugate of U(1) gauge field) plays a role of the order parameter in the
Green-Schwarz formalism: the super-D-string exists for $E^1 \ne 0$ while the
fundamental Green-Schwarz superstring exists only for $E^1 =0$.

suspended in an external magnetic field. The mass of the open string stretched
between the brane and the anti-brane approaches a finite positive value even
when the branes coincide. Similar result is obtained for a Dirichlet six brane

a class (or property) of $n$-manifold invariants. An invariant $v=v(M)$ is in
this class if, for any triangulated manifold $|G|=M$, one has that $v(M)$ is a
linear function of $f(G)$. This paper defines a flag vector $f(G)$ for
$i$-graphs, whose associated invariants might be quantum, and which is of
interest in its own right. The definition (via the concept of shelling, and a
`disjoint pair of optional cells' rule for the link) seems to apply to any
finite combinatorial object, and so to any compact topological object that can
be triangulated. It also applies to finite groups.

a movable mirror can be utilized to generate a large variety of nonclassical
states of both the cavity field and the mirror. First we consider state
preparation of the cavity field. The system dynamics will prepare a single mode
of the cavity field in a multicomponent Schr\""{o}dinger cat state, in a similar
manner to that in a Kerr medium. In addition, when two or more cavity modes
interact with the mirror, they may be prepared in an entangled state which may
be regarded as a multimode generalisation of even and odd coherent states. We
show also that near-number states of a single mode may be prepared by
performing a measurement of the position of the mirror. Secondly we consider
state preparation of the mirror, and show that this macroscopic object may be
placed in a Scr\""{o}dinger cat state by a quadrature measurement of the light
field. In addition we examine the effect of the damping of the motion of the
mirror on the field states inside the cavity, and compare this with the effect
of cavity field damping.

molecules of the ordered water in the interior of the MT cylinders. We suggest
specific experiments to test the above-conjectured quantum nature of the
microtubular arrangements inside the cell. These experiments are similar in
