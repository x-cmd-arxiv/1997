throughout the year, through sodium absorption line measurements in stellar and
solar spectra. Previous measurements, e.g. Papen et al, 1996, have not been
made at this latitude (32 degrees). Further, our absorption method is more
direct and may be more accurate than the lidar methods normally used. The
seasonal variation amplitude is smaller than that at higher latitudes. While
the annual mean sodium column density tends to be lower than at higher

of two within an hour.

$m_{B^+}-m_{B^0} = - 0.83\pm 0.34 MeV$ and $m_{D^+}-m_{D^0} = + 4.33\pm 0.37
MeV$, are in agreement with the experimental measurements: $m_{B^+}-m_{B^0} = -
0.35\pm 0.29 MeV$ and $m_{D^+}-m_{D^0} = + 4.78\pm 0.10 MeV$. We also compute
the mass differences in the infinite heavy quark mass limit, which show small
deviations from the finite mass results for the B case and 30% effects in the
charm case.

identify the spaces of doubly periodic operators on which a full hierarchy of
commuting flows can be introduced, and show that these flows are Hamiltonian
with respect to a universal symplectic form $\omega={1\over 2}\r_{\infty}
<\Psi_0^*\delta L\wedge\delta\Psi_0>\d k$. We also construct other higher order
symplectic forms and compare our formalism with the case of 1D solitons.
Restricted to spaces of finite-gap solitons, the universal symplectic form
agrees with the symplectic forms which have recently appeared in non-linear WKB
theory, topological field theory, and Seiberg-Witten theories. We take the
opportunity to survey some developments in these areas where symplectic forms
have played a major role.

Kelvin and Rossby waves in the sensitivities to sea level and wind stress at

and weak eastern boundary reflections. Depending on the thermocline depth the
first and second baroclinic modes are excited. The sensitivities to the heat
flux and SST are local and decay in about a month. The sensitivities to the
fluxes are converted into the influence of SST using the adjoint of a
statistical atmosphere model. Focusing on SST perturbations in the index region
itself, we recover, up to a scale factor, the delayed oscillator concept.

Pound-Overhauser double resonance, and the other using a spin-coherence double
resonance pulse sequence; (2) Demonstrated that the square root of the
Pound-Overhauser XOR corresponds to a conditional rotation, thus obtaining a
universal set of gates; (3) Devised a spin-coherence implementation of the
Toffoli gate, and confirmed that it transforms the equilibrium state of a
four-spin system as expected; (4) Used standard gradient-pulse techniques in
NMR to equalize all but one of the populations in a two-spin system, so
obtaining the pseudo-pure state that corresponds to |00>; (5) Validated that
one can identify which basic pseudo-pure state is present by transforming it
into one-spin superpositions, whose associated spectra jointly characterize the
state; (6) Applied the spin-coherence XOR gate to a one-spin superposition to
create an entangled state, and confirmed its existence by detecting the
associated double-quantum coherence via gradient-echo methods.
