Borealis Supercluster (z ~ 0.07) based on the redshifts for 528 galaxies in the
supercluster. The galaxy distribution within Corona Borealis is clumpy and
appears overall to be far from relaxed. A background supercluster at z ~ 0.11
makes a substantial contribution to the projected surface density of galaxies
in the Corona Borealis field. In order to estimate the mass of the
supercluster, we have assumed that the mass of the supercluster is proportional
to v^2r, where v and r are suitable scale velocity and radius, respectively,
and we have used N-body simulations of both critical- and low-density universes
to determine the applicability of standard mass estimators based on this
assumption. Although superclusters are obviously not in equilibrium, our
simulations demonstrate that the virial mass estimator yields mass estimates
with an insignificant bias and a dispersion of only ~25% for objects with
overdensities >~ 5. Non-uniform spatial sampling can, however, cause systematic
underestimates by as much as 30%. All of our simulated superclusters turn out
to be bound, and based on the overdensity of the Corona Borealis supercluster,
we believe it is also very likely to be bound and may well have started to
collapse. The mass of Corona Borealis is at least 3 x 10^16 solar masses, which
yields a B(AB)-band mass-to-light ratio of 564h (M/L)_solar on scales of ~20
h^-1 Mpc. The background supercluster has a mass-to-light ratio of 726h
(M/L)_solar. By comparing the supercluster mass-to-light ratios with the
critical mass-to-light ratio required to close the universe, we determine that
Omega_0 >~ 0.4 on supercluster scales.

2005, has as its goal astrometry with ~ 1 micro-arcsecond accuracy for stars as
faint as 20th mag. If the SIM lives to expectations it can be used to measure
astrometric displacements in the light centroid caused by gravitational
microlensing in the events detected photometrically from the ground. The effect
is typically ~ 0.1 mas, i.e. two orders of magnitude larger than planned SIM's
accuracy. Therefore, it will be possible to determine the mass, the distance,
and the proper motion of almost any MACHO capable of inducing a photometric
microlensing event towards the galactic bulge or the Magellanic Clouds, even
though no light from the MACHO has to be detected.
  For strong microlensing events in which the source is photometrically
resolved, like the recent MACHO 95-30 event, SIM's astrometry combined with
accurate ground based photometry will allow the determination of the angular
stellar radii, and therefore the effective temperature of the source.
  The effective astrometric cross sections for gravitational lensing by nearby
high proper motion stars and brown dwarfs are ~ (1'')^2 and the effective time
scales are ~ 1 year. SIM will provide the only practical way to measure masses
of single nearby objects with ~ 1% accuracy. The times of lensing events can be
predicted years ahead of time.

possibilities within the framework of QCD sum rules. Although the topological
current is built from local fields, we have found that its matrix element

produce artificial oscillations of the Ioffe-time distribution of polarized
