symbols which constitutes the chromosome, or ``genotype'', and the products
which this sequence encodes --- the ``phenotype''. This interface can be
thought of as a ``computer''. In this case the chromosome is viewed as an
algorithm and the phenotype as the result of the computation. In general only a
small fraction of all possible sequences of symbols makes any sense for a given
computer. The difficulty of finding meaningful algorithms by random mutation is
known as the brittleness problem. In this paper we show that mutation and
crossover favour the emergence of an algorithmic language which facilitates the
production of meaningful sequences following random mutations of the genotype.
We base our conclusions on an analysis of the population dynamics of a variant
of Kitano's neurogenetic model wherein the chromosome encodes the rules for
cellular division and the phenotype is a 16-cell organism interpreted as a
connectivity matrix for a feedforward neural network. We show that an
algorithmic language emerges, describe this language in extenso, and show how
it helps to solve the brittleness problem.

hold whenever semistability is equivalent to stability. In this paper we study
a typical ""opposite"" case, i.e. the moduli space $M_c$ of semistable rank-two
torsion-free sheaves on $X$ with trivial determinant and second Chern class
equal to an even number $c$. The moduli space $M_c$ always contains points
corresponding to strictly semistable sheaves. If $c$ is at least 4, then $M_c$
is singular along the locus parametrizing strictly semistable sheaves, and on
the smooth locus of $M_c$ there is a symplectic holomorphic form. Thus it is
natural to ask whether there is a symplectic desingularization of $M_c$. We
construct such a desingularization for $c=4$; in another paper we show that
this desingularization gives a new deformation class of (K\""ahler) holomorphic
irreducible symplectic varieties (of dimension ten). We also study the case
$c>4$. We describe what should be an interesting desingularization, however we

unrelated to the PDCS cluster candidates. The net surface density of X-ray
emitting cluster candidates in our survey, $1.71^{+0.91}_{-2.19}$ clusters

given the large error on our contamination rate, that we have not detected
X-ray emission from any of our observed PDCS cluster candidates. We find no

This suggests that the PDCS contains objects at high redshift similar to the

  We find that low energy X-ray cut-offs are more commonly (and perhaps

cut-offs are physically associated with the quasars, and not with intervening

in sensitivity to the Omega's, although this test still remains 50% more Omega

as the product of the mass-to-light ratio, M/L, of some clustered systems such

calculations will be accomplished. In this draft we develop a consistent
closure procedure for the calculation of the scaling exponents $\zeta_n$ of the
$n$th order correlation functions in fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence,
starting from first principles. The closure procedure is constructed to respect
the fundamental rescaling symmetry of the Euler equation. The starting point of
the procedure is an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations that are obeyed
identically with respect to scaling for any set of scaling exponents $\zeta_n$.
This hierarchy was discussed in detail in a recent publication [V.S. L'vov and
I. Procaccia, Phys. Rev. E, submitted, chao-dyn/9707015]. The scaling exponents
in this set of equations cannot be found from power counting. In this draft we
discuss in detail low order non-trivial closures of this infinite set of
equations, and prove that these closures lead to the determination of the
scaling exponents from solvability conditions. The equations under
consideration after this closure are nonlinear integro-differential equations,
reflecting the nonlinearity of the original Navier-Stokes equations.
Nevertheless they have a very special structure such that the determination of
the scaling exponents requires a procedure that is very similar to the solution
of linear homogeneous equations, in which amplitudes are determined by fitting
to the boundary conditions in the space of scales. The re-normalization scale
that i necessary for any anomalous scaling appears at this point. The Holder
inequalities on the scaling exponents select the renormalizaiton scale as the
outer scale of turbulence $L$.

Rev E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.56.4451",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We show here a general model of phase separation in isotropic condensed
matter, namely, a viscoelastic model. We propose that the bulk mechanical
relaxation modulus that has so far been ignored in previous theories plays an
important role in viscoelastic phase separation in addition to the shear
relaxation modulus. In polymer solutions, for example, attractive interactions
between polymers under a poor-solvent condition likely cause the transient
gellike behavior, which makes both bulk and shear modes active. Although such
attractive interactions between molecules of the same component exist
universally in the two-phase region of a mixture, the stress arising from
attractive interactions is asymmetrically divided between the components only
in dynamically asymmetric mixtures such as polymer solutions and colloidal
suspensions. Thus, the interaction network between the slower components, which
can store the elastic energy against its deformation through bulk and shear
moduli, is formed. It is the bulk relaxation modulus associated with this
interaction network that is primarily responsible for the appearance of the
sponge structure peculiar to viscoelastic phase separation and the phase
inversion. We demonstrate that a viscoelastic model of phase separation
including this new effect is a general model that can describe all types of
isotropic phase separation including solid and fluid models as its special
cases without any exception, if there is no coupling with additional order
parameter. The physical origin of volume shrinking behavior during viscoelastic
phase separation and the universality of the resulting spongelike structure are
also discussed.

without it. For the asymptotoic attractor solutions as well as the ""hesitation

basis of analyzing primordial nucleosynthesis. As a remedy, we propose to
modify the prototype BD theory, by introducing a scale-invariant scalar-matter
coupling, thus making Einstein frame acceptable. The invariacne is broken as a
quantum anomaly effect due to the non-gravitational interactions, entailing
naturally the fifth force, characterized by a finite force-range and WEP
violation. A tentative estimate shows that the theoretical prediction is
roughly consistent with the observational upper bounds. Further efforts to
improve the experimental accuracy is strongly encouraged.

magnetic quantum number in constant homogeneous magnetic field ${\cal H}$ are
considered. The coefficients of energy eigenvalues expansion up to 75th order
in powers of ${\cal H}^2$ are obtained for these states. The series for energy
eigenvalues and wave functions are summed up to ${\cal H}$ values of the order
of atomic magnetic field. The calculations are based on generalization of the
moment method, which may be used in other cases of the hydrogen atom
perturbation by a polynomial in coordinates potential.

follows naturally from the structure of four-dimensional Riemannian geometry. A
Yang-Mills field is introduced by constructing fibres that include all possible
exchanges of spin, parity and charge such that the collective quantum numbers
remain the same. In this way O(4) internal symmetry transformations are found
and a connection is obtained by exponentiation of a CP-invariant operator C
associated with the ground state. The metric is Calabi-Yau and Einstein. Carbon
13 is chosen as an example because it is the lightest nucleus to exhibit small
spin mutations even though there is no deformation parameter in the O(4)
commutation relations. Instead a supersymmetric transformation replaces a
quantum group. Mirror symmetry is also discussed.

action-angle variables with the following properties. i) The time evolution is
exactly given by classical evolution of the angle variables. (The angle
variable corresponding to the position on the orbit is now non-compact and we
do not get exactly the same state after one period. However the gross features
do not change. In particular the wave packet remains peaked around the labels.)
ii) Resolution of identity using this overcomplete set involves exactly the
classical phase space measure. iii) Semi-classical limit is related to
Bohr-Sommerfield quantization. iv) They are almost minimum uncertainty wave
packets in position and momentum.
