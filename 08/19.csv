not far out of alignment with the stars. Lens galaxies obey image
separation/lens luminosity correlations analogous to the Faber-Jackson and

that these stars may be mixing helium from the hydrogen shell outward into the
envelope, presumably as a result of internal rotation. We have investigated the
implications of such helium mixing for both the red- giant-branch (RGB) and
horizontal-branch (HB) phases by computing a number of noncanonical
evolutionary sequences for different assumed mixing depths and mass loss rates.
We find that the helium-mixed models evolve to higher luminosities during the
RGB phase and consequently lose more mass than their canonical counterparts.
This enhanced mass loss together with the higher envelope helium abundances of
the helium-mixed models produces a markedly bluer and somewhat brighter HB
morphology. As a result, helium mixing can mimic age as a 2nd parameter and can
reduce the ages of the metal-poor globular clusters derived from the luminosity
difference between the HB and the main-sequence turnoff. Helium mixing might
also lead to a larger RR Lyrae period shift and to a steeper slope for the RR
Lyrae luminosity - metallicity relation if the mixing is more extensive at low
metallicities, as suggested by the observed abundance variations. We discuss
the implications of helium mixing for a number of other topics including the
low gravities of the blue HB stars, the origin of the extreme HB stars, and the
evolutionary status of the sdO stars. A variety of observational tests are
presented to test this helium-mixing scenario.

spacetime dimensions with a large number of QCD colors (the 't Hooft model) as
a function of the heavy quark mass. In this limit, QCD is exactly soluble, and
decay modes are dominated by two-particle final states. We compare the results
to the tree-level partonic decay width of the heavy quark in order to test
quark-hadron duality in this universe. We find that this duality is
surprisingly well satisfied in the heavy quark limit, in that the difference
between the sum of exclusive partial widths and the tree-level partonic width
approaches a constant as M --> infinity, and the deviation is well-fit by a
small 1/M correction. We comment on the meaning of this conclusion and its
implications for the use of quark-hadron duality in hadronic physics.

theoretically clean. In particular, they do not depend on the values of
hadronic parameters. The sign of the asymmetries, however, does depend on the
sign of the $B_B$ parameter. Furthermore, the information from $\epsilon_K$
that all angles of the unitarity triangles lie in the range $\{0,\pi\}$ depends
on the sign of the $B_K$ parameter. Consequently, in the (unlikely) case that
the vacuum insertion approximation is such a poor approximation that either
$B_B$ or $B_K$ is negative, the sign of CP asymmetries in neutral $B$ decays
will be opposite to the standard predictions. Various subtleties concerning the
role of $K-\bar K$ mixing in the case of final states with a single $K_S$ or

obtains for s = 2,3 in the scaling (short distance) limit the algebra of local

non-trivial center and describes charged physical states satisfying Gauss' law.
The latter result is of relevance for the interpretation of the Schwinger model

the method.

this originates from a complicated mixing between $\lambda$ and other fields.
Hence it may depend on the decoupling procedure. It is shown that $\lambda$
depends on the gauge choices such as the harmonic, dilaton gauges, and the
Krasnitz-Klebanov setting for $h_{\mu\nu}$. It turns out that $\nu$ plays a
role of test field well, while the role of $\lambda$ is obscure.
