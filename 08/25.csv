supernovae in binary systems that have each emerged from a common-envelope
phase. LMXB progenitors must satisfy a large number of evolutionary and
structural constraints, which imposed under the assumption of a symmetric
supernova explosion, prohibit the formation of short-period LMXBs transferring
mass at sub-Eddington rates through any channel in which the intermediate
progenitor of the neutron star is not completely degenerate. Barring
accretion-induced collapse, the existence of such systems therefore requires
that natal kicks be imparted to neutron stars. We use an analytical method to
synthesize the distribution of nascent LMXBs over donor masses and orbital
periods, and evaluate their birth rate and systemic velocity dispersion. Within
the limitations imposed by observational incompleteness and selection effects,
and our neglect of secular evolution in the LMXB state, we compare our results
with observations. However, our principal objective is to evaluate how basic
model parameters influence these results. We conclude that the characteristics
of newborn LMXBs are primarily determined by age and stability constraints and
the efficiency of magnetic braking, and are largely independent of the
primordial binary population and the evolutionary history of LMXB progenitors
(except for extreme values of the average kick magnitude or of the
common-envelope ejection efficiency). Theoretical estimates of total LMXB birth
rates are not credible, since they strongly depend on the observationally
indeterminate frequency of primordial binaries with extreme mass ratios in
long-period orbits.

dwarf spheroidals. The median M-K colour for galaxies with -19.3 < M_K < -16.3
is 3.6 mag. (ii) The K-band luminosity function in the Coma cluster at the
faint-end is not wee constrained, because of the uncertainties due to the
field-to-field variance of the background. However, within the estimate large
errors, it is consistent with the R-band luminosity function, shifted by
$\sim3$ magnitudes. (iii) Many of the cluster dwarfs lie in a region of the B-K
vs. B-R colour-colour diagram where background galaxies are rare Local dwarf
spheroidal galaxies lie in this region too. This suggests that a better
measurement of the K-band cluster luminosity function can be made if the
field-to-field variance of the background can be measured as a function of
colour. (iv) If we assume that none of the galaxies in the region of the B-K

the cluster galaxies with $15.5 < K < 18.5$ lie in this region of the plane,

similar growth of clustering of pressureless dust out of a power-law spectrum
of primeval Gaussian mass density fluctuations (index n) in an Einstein-de
Sitter cosmological model. The self-similar two-point correlation function, xi,
seems to be well established. The renormalization solutions for xi show a
satisfying insensitivity to the parameters in the method, and at n=-1 and 0 are
close to the Hamilton et al. formula for interpolation between the large-scale
perturbative limit and stable small-scale clustering. The solutions are tested
by comparing the mean relative peculiar velocity <v_ij> of particle pairs and
the velocity derived from xi under the assumption of self-similar evolution.
Both the renormalization and a comparison conventional N-body solution are in
reasonable agreement with the test, although the conventional approach does
slightly better at large separations and the renormalization approach slightly
better at small separations. Other comparisons of renormalization and
conventional solutions are more demanding and the results less satisfactory.
Maps of particle positions in redshift space in the renormalization solutions
show more nearly empty voids and less prominent walls than do the conventional
solutions. The rms relative velocity dispersion is systematically smaller in
the renormalization solution. There also are sizeable differences in the
frequency distributions of clump masses in the renormalization and conventional
solutions. The third moment S_3 from the distribution of mass within cells is
in reasonable agreement with second-order perturbation theory on large scales,
while on scales less than the clustering length S_3 is roughly consistent with
hierarchical clustering but is heavily affected by shot noise.

  Physics",,,"HIP-1997-32/TH","cond-mat",,"  We consider the quantum dynamics of a magnetic domain wall at low
temperatures, where dissipative couplings to magnons and electrons are very
small. The wall motion is then determined by its coupling to phonons and
nuclear spins, and any pinning potentials. In the absence of nuclear spins
there is a dominant superOhmic 1-phonon coupling to the wall velocity, plus a
strongly T-dependent Ohmic coupling to pairs of phonons. There is also a
T-independent Ohmic coupling between single phonons and the wall chirality,
which suppresses ``chirality tunneling''. We calculate the effect of these
couplings on the T-dependent tunneling rate of a wall out of a pinning
potential. Nuclear spins have a very strong and hitherto unsuspected influence
on domain wall dynamics, coming from a hyperfine-mediated coupling to the
domain wall position. For $k_B T \gg \omega_{0}$ this coupling yields a
spatially random potential, fluctuating at a rate governed by the nuclear
$T_2$. When $k_B T \ll \omega_{0}$, the hyperfine potential fluctuates around a
linear binding potential. The wall dynamics is influenced by the fluctuations
of this potential, ie., by the nuclear spin dynamics. Wall tunneling can occur
when fluctuations open an occasional ``tunneling window''. This changes the
crossover to tunneling and also causes a slow ""wandering"", in time, of the
energy levels associated with domain wall motion inside the pinning potential.
This effect is fairly weak in $Ni$- and $Fe$- based magnets, and we give an
approximate treatment of its effect on the tunneling dynamics, as well as a
discussion of the relationship to recent domain wall tunneling experiments.

so-called phenomenological Lagrangians since they were in general
non-renormalizable. Today they are treated as effective field theories valid
below a characteristic energy scale. Quantum corrections can then be calculated
in a consistent way as for any renormalizable theory. A few applications of the
Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian for interacting photons at low energies are
presented together with recent developments in the use of QED for
non-relativistic systems. Finally, the ingredients of an effective theory for
the electroweak sector of the Standard Model are discussed in the case of a
non-linear realization of the Higgs mechanism using the Stuckelberg formalism.

N=1 supersymmetric $Sp(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ flavors in four

studying the orientifold which plays a crucial role in our work. When all the
quark masses are the same, the surface of the M theory spacetime representing a
nontrivial ${\bf S^1}$ bundle over ${\bf R^3}$ develops $A_{N_f-1}$ type
singularities at two points where D6 branes are located. Furthermore, by
turning off the masses, two singular points on the surface collide and produce
$A_{2N_f-1}$ type singularity. The sum of the multiplicities of rational curves
on the resolved surface gives the dimension of N=2 Higgs branch which agrees
with the counting from the brane configuration picture of type IIA string
theory. By rotating M theory fivebranes we get the strongly coupled dynamics of
N=1 theory and describe the vacuum expectation values of the meson field
parameterizing Higgs branch which are in complete agreement with the field
theory results. Finally, we take the limit where the mass of adjoint chiral
multiplet goes to infinity and compare with field theory results. For massive
case, we comment on some relations with recent work which deals with N=1
duality in the context of M theory.

  Field Theory and Gravity (July-August 1997)",,,"DSF preprint 97/42","hep-th",,"  Recent progress in quantum field theory and quantum gravity relies on mixed
boundary conditions involving both normal and tangential derivatives of the
quantized field. In particular, the occurrence of tangential derivatives in the
boundary operator makes it possible to build a large number of new local
invariants. The integration of linear combinations of such invariants of the
orthogonal group yields the boundary contribution to the asymptotic expansion
of the integrated heat-kernel. This can be used, in turn, to study the one-loop
semiclassical approximation. The coefficients of linear combination are now
being computed for the first time. They are universal functions, in that are
functions of position on the boundary not affected by conformal rescalings of
the background metric, invariant in form and independent of the dimension of
the background Riemannian manifold. In Euclidean quantum gravity, the problem
arises of studying infinitely many universal functions.

bath is studied. The register consists of $N$ qubits (i.e. spin ${1/2}$ degrees
of freedom), the bath is described by $N_b$ bosonic modes. The register-bath
coupling is chosen in such a way that the total number of excitations is
conserved. The Hilbert space splits allowing the study of the dynamics
separately in each sector. Assuming that the coupling with the bath is the same
for all qubits, the excitation sectors have a further decomposition according
the irreducible representations of the $su(2)$ spin algebra. The stability
against environment-generated noise of the information encoded in a quantum
state of the register depends on its $su(2)$ symmetry content. At zero
temperature we find that states belonging to the vacuum symmetry sector have
for long time vanishing fidelity, whereas each lowest spin vector is decoupled
from the bath and therefore is decoherence free. Numerical results are shown in
the one-excitation space in the case qubit-dependent bath-system coupling.
