all but one of the X-ray detected groups, the X-ray emission is centered on a
luminous elliptical galaxy. Fits to the surface brightness profiles of the

The first component is centered on the central elliptical galaxy. The location
and extent of this component, combined with its X-ray temperature and
luminosity, favor an origin in the interstellar medium of the central galaxy.
Alternatively, the central component may be the result of a large-scale cooling
flow. The second X-ray component is detected out to a radius of at least
100-300 kpc. This component follows the same relationships found among the
X-ray temperature, X-ray luminosity and optical velocity dispersion of rich
clusters. This result suggests that the X-ray detected groups are low-mass
versions of clusters and that the extended gas component can properly be called
the intragroup medium, in analogy to the intracluster medium in clusters. We
also find a trend for the position angle of the optical light in the central

complex and interesting. Energy and momentum flux from the radio jet have been
significant in the dynamics of the gas in the core. In addition, the Faraday

X-ray luminous gas is not a simple, spherically symmetric cooling inflow. In
addition, we believe the X-ray gas has had strong effects on the radio source.
It seems to have disrupted the jet flow, which has led to dynamical history
very different from the usual radio galaxy. This particular source is much
younger than the galaxy, which suggests the disruptive effects lead to an

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/305119",,"astro-ph",,"  Jets and pulsar-fed supernova remnants (plerions) tend to develop highly
organized toroidal magnetic field. Such a field structure could explain the
polarization properties of some jets, and contribute to their lateral
confinement. A toroidal field geometry is also central to models for the Crab
Nebula - the archetypal plerion - and leads to the deduction that the Crab
pulsar's wind must have a weak magnetic field. Yet this `Z-pinch' field
configuration is well known to be locally unstable, even when the magnetic
field is weak and/or boundary conditions slow or suppress global modes. Thus,
the magnetic field structures imputed to the interiors of jets and plerions are
unlikely to persist.
  To demonstrate this, I present a local analysis of Z-pinch instabilities for
relativistic fluids in the ideal MHD limit. Kink instabilities dominate,
destroying the concentric field structure and probably driving the system
toward a more chaotic state in which the mean field strength is independent of
radius (and in which resistive dissipation of the field may be enhanced). I
estimate the timescales over which the field structure is likely to be
rearranged and relate these to distances along relativistic jets and radii from
the central pulsar in a plerion.
  I conclude that a concentric toroidal field is unlikely to exist well outside
the Crab pulsar's wind termination shock. There is thus no dynamical reason to
conclude that the magnetic energy flux carried by the pulsar wind is much
weaker than the kinetic energy flux. Abandoning this inference would resolve a
long-standing puzzle in pulsar wind theory.

of the aperture mass is a convolution of the power spectrum of the projected
density field with a narrow kernel, so that <Map**2(theta)> provides a well
localized estimate of the power spectrum at wavenumbers s~5/theta. We calculate
<Map**2(theta)> for various cosmological models, using the fully non-linear
power spectrum of the cosmic density fluctuations. The non-linear evolution
yields a significant increase of <Map**2> relative to the linear growth on
scales below ~0.5 degree. The third-order moment of Map can be used to define a
skewness, which is a measure of the non-Gaussianity of the density field. We
present the first calculation of the skewness of the shear in the frame of
quasi-linear theory of structure growth. We show that it yields a sensitive
measure of the cosmological model; in particular, it is independent of the
normalization of the power spectrum. Several practical estimates for <Map**2>

cycle between chaotic sets; this `cycling chaos' manifests itself as
trajectories that spend increasingly long periods lingering near chaotic
invariant sets interspersed with short transitions between neighbourhoods of
these sets. This behaviour can be robust (i.e., structurally stable) for
systems with symmetries and provides robust examples of non-ergodic attractors
in such systems; we examine bifurcations of this state.
  We discuss a scenario where an attracting cycling chaotic state is created at
a blowout bifurcation of a chaotic attractor in an invariant subspace. This is
a novel scenario for the blowout bifurcation and causes us to introduce the
idea of set supercriticality to recognise such bifurcations. The robust cycling
chaotic state can be followed to a point where it loses stability at a
resonance bifurcation and creates a series of large period attractors.
  The model we consider is a 9th order truncated ODE model of three-dimensional
incompressible convection in a plane layer of conducting fluid subjected to a
vertical magnetic field and a vertical temperature gradient. Symmetries of the
model lead to the existence of invariant subspaces for the dynamics; in
particular there are invariant subspaces that correspond to regimes of
two-dimensional flows. Stable two-dimensional chaotic flow can go unstable to
three-dimensional flow via the cross-roll instability. We show how the
bifurcations mentioned above can be located by examination of various
transverse Liapunov exponents. We also consider a reduction of the ODE to a map
and demonstrate that the same behaviour can be found in the corresponding map.

transformation such that the resulting configuration variables describe the
dynamical properties of Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black holes in a natural manner.
The classical Hamiltonian written in terms of these variables and their
conjugate momenta is replaced by the corresponding self-adjoint Hamiltonian
operator, and an eigenvalue equation for the ADM mass of the hole, from the
point of view of a distant observer at rest, is obtained. Our eigenvalue
equation implies that the ADM mass and the electric charge spectra of the hole
are discrete, and the mass spectrum is bounded below. Moreover, the spectrum of
the quantity $M^2-Q^2$ is strictly positive when an appropriate self-adjoint
extension is chosen. The WKB analysis yields the result that the large
eigenvalues of the quantity $\sqrt{M^2-Q^2}$ are of the form $\sqrt{2n}$, where
$n$ is an integer. It turns out that this result is closely related to
Bekenstein's proposal on the discrete horizon area spectrum of black holes.

decay t -> W^+ b is found to be, in general, below the 0.1% level which is
somewhat smaller than previous claims. For a low \tan\beta of order one the
decay asymmetry can reach at the most ~0.3%. This (few) percent level overall
CP-violating signal in p p-bar -> t b-bar +X -> W^+ b b-bar +X might be within
the reach of the future 2(4) TeV pp-bar Tevatron collider that may be able to
produce ~10000(~30000) such tb-bar events with an integrated luminosity of 30

(~few \times 10^{-3}) may also be within the reach of the LHC with ~10^7 pairs

also show that if the GUT-scale universality of the soft breaking trilinear $A$

off, only three of the nine parametrizations are acceptable. In particular the
``standard'' parametrization advocated by the Particle Data Group is not
permitted. One parametrization, in which the CP-violating phase is restricted
to the light quark sector, stands up as the most favorable description of the
flavor mixing.

less than 1% in the $q^2$-range from above $t\bar t$-treshold up to
$\sqrt{q^2}= 1000 GeV$. In the $e^+e^-\to b\bar b$ case the $O(\alpha_s)$
corrections reduce the asymmetry value from its $m=0$ value of -1 to
approximately -0.96 for $q^2$-values around the Z-peak. This reduction can be
traced to finite anomalous contributions from residual mass effects which
survive the $m\to 0$ limit. We discuss the role of the anomalous contributions
and the pattern of how they contribute to spin-flip and no-flip terms.

scheme we investigate SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a torus in 2+1 spacetime

interaction in this partial wave. Since the most recent NN interactions are
charge-dependent, we have to solve coupled gap equations for proton-proton,
neutron-neutron, and neutron-proton pairing in nuclear matter. The results,
however, are found to be close to those obtained with charge-independent
potentials.

  Revtex 29 pages including 1 page with figures","Phys.Rev. A57 (1998) 1604","10.1103/PhysRevA.57.1604",,"quant-ph",,"  In consistent history quantum theory, a description of the time development
of a quantum system requires choosing a framework or consistent family, and
then calculating probabilities for the different histories which it contains.
It is argued that the framework is chosen by the physicist constructing a
description of a quantum system on the basis of questions he wishes to address,
in a manner analogous to choosing a coarse graining of the phase space in
classical statistical mechanics. The choice of framework is not determined by
some law of nature, though it is limited by quantum incompatibility, a concept
which is discussed using a two-dimensional Hilbert space (spin half particle).
Thus certain questions of physical interest can only be addressed using
frameworks in which they make (quantum mechanical) sense. The physicist's
choice does not influence reality, nor does the presence of choices render the
theory subjective. On the contrary, predictions of the theory can, in
principle, be verified by experimental measurements. These considerations are
used to address various criticisms and possible misunderstandings of the
consistent history approach, including its predictive power, whether it
requires a new logic, whether it can be interpreted realistically, the nature
of ``quasiclassicality'', and the possibility of ``contrary'' inferences.
