circular orbit is usually expressed as an infinite sum over radiative multipole
moments. In a slow-motion approximation, each multipole moment is then
expressed as a post-Newtonian expansion in powers of v/c, the ratio of the
orbital velocity to the speed of light. The bare multipole truncation of the
radiation consists in keeping only the leading-order term in the post-Newtonian
expansion of each moment, but summing over all the multipole moments. In the
case of binary systems with small mass ratios, the bare multipole series was
shown in a previous paper to converge for all values v/c < 2/e, where e is the
base of natural logarithms. In this paper, we extend the analysis to a dressed
multipole truncation of the radiation, in which the leading-order moments are
corrected with terms of relative order (v/c)^2 and (v/c)^3. We find that the
dressed multipole series converges also for all values v/c < 2/e, and that it
coincides (within 1%) with the numerically ``exact'' results for v/c < 0.2.

Because the $\sigma$ model is an effective field theory there is an actual
momentum cutoff (Landau pole) in the theory at around 1 GeV. Thus it is
necessary to find ways of obtaining a covariantly conserved, renormalized
energy-momentum tensor when there is a cutoff present (which breaks
covariance), in order to identify the effective equation of state of this time
evolving system. We show how to solve this technical problem and then determine
the energy density and pressure of the system as a function of the proper time.
We consider different initial conditions and search for instabilities which can
lead to the formation of disoriented chiral condensates (DCCs). We find that
the energy density and pressure both decrease quickly, as is appropriate for a
rapidly cooling system, and that the energy is numerically conserved.

observables $\varepsilon$ and Re$(\varepsilon'/\varepsilon)$ describing CP
violation in neutral $K$ decays do not allow a powerful test of the CKM
mechanism of CP violation, rare $K\to\pi\nu\overline{\nu}$ decays and in
particular the $B$-meson system are much more promising in this respect. After
a brief look at the $K$ system, selected aspects of CP-violating effects in $B$
decays are discussed. It is pointed out that combined branching ratios for
$B\to\pi K$ modes, which have been observed recently by the CLEO collaboration,
may allow to derive stringent constraints on the CKM angle $\gamma$ that could
open a window to new physics.

elements governing the light neutrino mass mediated mode of neutrinoless double
beta decay of Ge76, Mo100, Cd116, Te128 and Xe136 within the proton-neutron
quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) and the renormalized QRPA
with proton-neutron pairing (full-RQRPA) methods. We have found that the
nuclear matrix elements obtained with the standard pn-QRPA for several nuclear
transitions are extremely sensitive to the renormalization of the
particle-particle component of the residual interaction of the nuclear
hamiltonian. Therefore the standard pn-QRPA does not guarantee the necessary
accuracy to allow us to extract a reliable limit on the effective neutrino
mass. This behaviour, already known from the calculation of the two-neutrino
double beta decay matrix elements, manifests itself in the neutrinoless
double-beta decay but only if a large model space is used. The full-RQRPA,
which takes into account proton-neutron pairing and considers the Pauli
principle in an approximate way, offers a stable solution in the physically
acceptable region of the particle-particle strength. In this way more accurate
values on the effective neutrino mass have been deduced from the experimental
lower limits of the half-lifes of neutrinoless double beta decay.
