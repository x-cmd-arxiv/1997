adaptability of a species to changes in the environment. In the case of a
virus, the claim is that the codon bias in the neutralization epitope improves
the virus' ability to generate mutants that evade the induced immune response.
We support our claim with a simple ``toy model'' of a viral epitope evolving in
competition with the immune system. The effective selective advantage of a
higher mutability leads to a dominance of codons that favour non-synonymous
mutations. The results in this paper suggest the possibility of emergence of an
algorithmic language in more complicated systems.

morphological types do not evolve, we compare the galaxies that form in low
density environments but end up later in high density environments to the ones
that form also in low density environment but remain in low density
environment. The first group contains a larger proportion of E and S0 galaxies
than the second group. We assume that the galaxy formation process cannot
distinguish a low density environment that will always remain low density from
one that will eventually become high density. Hence, these results force us to
discard the null hypothesis of no morphological evolution. Our study suggests
that 75% of the E and S0 galaxies observed at present formed as such, while the
remaining 25% formed as spirals, and underwent morphological evolution. We
conclude that most galaxies did not undergo morphological evolution, but a

larger to smaller angular scales which produces a fractional change in power
spectrum that increases rapidly beyond $\ell \sim 2000$. We also find that
lensing produces a nonzero mean magnification of structures on surfaces of
constant redshift if weighted by area on the sky. This is a result of the fact
that light-rays that are evenly distributed on the sky oversample overdense
regions. However this mean magnification has a negligible affect on the CMB
power spectrum. A new expression for the lensed power spectrum is derived and
it is found that future precision observations the high-$\ell$ tail of the

direct evidence for the absence of a solid surface. On the other hand, in order

equation of state to apply already at densities an order of magnitude below
that of nuclear matter and this might well be considered implausible on
physical grounds. We also describe how rotation affects the situation and

$\nu$ and an anisotropy exponent $z$. We derive scaling laws for the radius of

is a system of particles which jump at rates $p$ and $1-p$ (here $p>1/2$) to
adjacent empty sites on their right and left respectively. The system is
described on suitable macroscopic spatial and temporal scales by the inviscid
Burgers' equation; the latter has shock solutions with a discontinuous jump
from left density $\rho_-$ to right density $\rho_+$, $\rho_-<\rho_+$, which
travel with velocity $(2p-1)(1-\rho_+-\rho_-)$. In the microscopic system we
may track the shock position by introducing a second class particle, which is
attracted to and travels with the shock. In this paper we obtain the time
invariant measure for this shock solution in the ASEP, as seen from such a
particle. The mean density at lattice site $n$, measured from this particle,
approaches $\rho_{\pm}$ at an exponential rate as $n\to\pm\infty$, with a
characteristic length which becomes independent of $p$ when
$p/(1-p)>\sqrt{\rho_+(1-\rho_-)/\rho_-(1-\rho_+)}$. For a special value of the

Bernoulli, with density $\rho_-$ on the left and $\rho_+$ on the right. In the
weakly asymmetric limit, $2p-1\to0$, the microscopic width of the shock
diverges as $(2p-1)^{-1}$. The stationary measure is then essentially a
superposition of Bernoulli measures, corresponding to a convolution of a
density profile described by the viscous Burgers equation with a well-defined

exhibits spin-charge separation, visible as an extra energy scale in the
discrete tunneling density of states (for which we give an analytic form),
signaling a departure from the orthodox theory of Coulomb blockade.

thermal activation, whereas at temperatures close to zero quantum tunneling is
relevant. At some temperature $T_{c}$ the transition from classical to
quantum-dominated decay occurs. The transition can be first-order like, with a
discontinuous first derivative of the Euclidean action, or smooth with only a
second derivative developing a jump. In the former case the crossover
temperature $T_{c}$ cannot be calculated perturbatively and must be found as
the intersection point of the Euclidean actions calculated at low and high
temperatures. In this paper we present a sufficient criterion for a first-order
transition in tunneling problems and apply it to the problem of the tunneling
of strings. It is shown that the problem of the depinning of a massive string

and spin effects are omitted. The self-energy is evaluated, self-consistently

integral. In the Hartree approximation, $O((1/N_c)^0)$, the Vlasov equation is
recovered to $O(\hbar^1)$, together with an on-mass shell constraint equation,
that is automatically fulfilled by the quasiparticle ansatz. The expressions
for the self-energy to order $O((1/N_c))$ lead to the collision term. Here one
sees explicitly that particle-antiparticle creation and annihilation processes
are suppressed that would otherwise be present, should an off-shell energy
spectral function be admitted. A clear identification of the $s$, $t$ and $u$

process, $\sigma(\gamma^{*}p)\leq C(ln 1/x)^{5/2}$.A simple model the published
experimental data over a wide range of photon virtualities ($Q^2$) and energies
($W$), is developed. This model provides a quantitative way of evaluating the
relative rate of the small and large distance contributions, in the different
kinematic regions. The main results of the analysis are (i) that even at $Q^2
=0$ and high energies the short distance contribution is not small, and it
provides a possible explanation for the experimental rise of the
photoproduction cross section; and (ii) at large values of $Q^2$, the long
distance processes still contribute to the total cross section.

interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a magnetic trap and an additional
rf field transferring atoms to an untrapped Zeeman sublevel. For weak output
coupling we calculate the dynamics of the decaying condensate population, of
its chemical potential and the velocity of the output atoms analytically.

  of entanglement distillation","RevTeX, 13 pages, rewritten to more readable form, some details added",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We analyse the problem of distillation of entanglement of mixed states in
higher dimensional compound systems. Employing the positive maps method [M.
Horodecki et al., Phys. Lett. A 223 1 (1996)] we introduce and analyse a
criterion of separability which relates the structures of the total density
matrix and its reductions. We show that any state violating the criterion can
be distilled by suitable generalization of the two-qubit protocol which
distills any inseparable two-qubit state. Conversely, all the states which can
be distilled by such a protocol must violate the criterion. The proof involves
construction of the family of states which are invariant under transformation
$\varrho\to U\otimes U^*\varrho U^\dagger\otimes U^{*\dagger}$ where $U$ is a
unitary transformation and star denotes complex conjugation. The states are
related to the depolarizing channel generalized to non-binary case.

construction of KdV type hierarchies is a quadruplet $(\A,\Lambda, d_1, d_0)$,
where the $d_i$ are $\Z$-gradations of a loop algebra $\A$ and $\Lambda\in \A$
is a semisimple element of nonzero $d_1$-grade. A new sufficient condition on
the quadruplet under which the construction works is proposed and examples are
presented. The proposal relies on splitting the $d_1$-grade zero part of $\A$
into a vector space direct sum of two subalgebras. This permits one to
interpret certain Gelfand-Dickey type systems associated with a nonstandard
splitting of the algebra of pseudo-differential operators in the
Drinfeld-Sokolov framework.
