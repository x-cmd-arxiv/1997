bundles on $\proj{n}$ and assume that the degeneracy locus, $X$, of $\phi$ has
the expected codimension. We call $B_{\phi} = \ker \phi$ a (first)
Buchsbaum-Rim sheaf and we call $X$ a standard determinantal scheme. Viewing
$\phi$ as a matrix (after choosing bases), we say that $X$ is good if one can
delete a generalized row from $\phi$ and have the maximal minors of the
resulting submatrix define a scheme of the expected codimension. In this paper
we give several characterizations of good determinantal schemes. In particular,
it is shown that being a good determinantal scheme of codimension $r+1$ is
equivalent to being the zero-locus of a regular section of the dual of a first
Buchsbaum-Rim sheaf of rank $r+1$. It is also equivalent to being standard
determinantal and locally a complete intersection outside a subscheme $Y
\subset X$ of codimension $r+2$. Furthermore, for any good determinantal
subscheme $X$ of codimension $r+1$ there is a good determinantal subscheme $S$
codimension $r$ such that $X$ sits in $S$ in a nice way. This leads to several
generalizations of a theorem of Kreuzer. For example, we show that for a
zeroscheme $X$ in $\proj{3}$, being good determinantal is equivalent to the
existence of an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve $S$, which is a local
complete intersection, such that $X$ is a subcanonical Cartier divisor on $S$.

$Z = \Proj R$ where $R$ is a graded Gorenstein K-algebra. They are reflexive
sheaves arising as the sheafification of kernels of sufficiently general maps
between free R-modules. Then we study multiple sections of a Buchsbaum-Rim
sheaf $\cBf$, i.e, we consider morphisms $\psi: \cP \to \cBf$ of sheaves on $Z$
dropping rank in the expected codimension, where $H^0_*(Z,\cP)$ is a free
R-module. The main purpose of this paper is to study properties of schemes
associated to the degeneracy locus $S$ of $\psi$. It turns out that $S$ is
often not equidimensional. Let $X$ denote the top-dimensional part of $S$. In
this paper we measure the ``difference'' between $X$ and $S$, compute their
cohomology modules and describe ring-theoretic properties of their coordinate
rings. Moreover, we produce graded free resolutions of $X$ (and $S$) which are
in general minimal. Among the applications we show how one can embed a
subscheme into an arithmetically Gorenstein subscheme of the same dimension and
prove that zero-loci of sections of the dual of a null correlation bundle are
arithmetically Buchsbaum.

redshift quasars ($z>2.7$), allowing statistical analysis of correlation
between quasar positions. In this study, clustering is identified through
comparison with $100 000$ Monte Carlo generated, randomly populated volumes,
which are identical to the observed region in spatial coordinates, redshift
distribution, and number of quasars. Three pairs have been observed with
comoving separations of 11.34, 12.97, and 24.13 h_{50}^{-1}Mpc (assuming
$q_0=0.5$), smaller separations than would be expected to arise by chance in an
unclustered distribution. Selection effects are ruled out as a false source of
clustering by scrambling the observed quasar coordinates and redshifts, which
gives a pair separation distribution nearly identical to that of the Monte
Carlo distribution. Tests using the distribution of pair separations and
nearest neighbor distances show that the observed pairs have a probability less
than 0.1% of arising in an unclustered distribution. Using a maximum likelihood
technique to estimate the correlation length $r_0$, assuming $\xi(r) =
(r/r_0)^{-1.8}$, we find $r_0 = 35\pm15 h_{50}^{-1}Mpc$ (comoving, $q_0=0.5$,
1$\sigma$ errors), a value much larger than the correlation length of
present-day galaxies.

effect of such perturbations on the growth of adiabatic energy density
perturbations in a cold dark matter component. We study two types of model, one
based on an exponential potential for the scalar field and the other on a
pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson. For each potential, we study two different
scenarios, one where the scalar field presently behaves as a decaying
cosmological constant and one where it behaves as dust. The initial scalar
field perturbations are fixed by the adiabatic condition, as expected from the
inflationary cosmology, though in fact we show that the choice of initial
condition is of little importance. Calculations are carried out in both the
zero-shear (conformal newtonian) and uniform-curvature gauges. We find that
both potentials allow models which can provide a successful alternative to
cosmological constant models.

consideration is based on a detailed investigation of the canonical formulation

of gravity for non-compact spacetimes or spacetimes with boundaries is
ill-defined unless one takes boundary degrees of freedom into account, we give
a Hamiltonian formulation of the Einstein-Hilbert-action as well as a
Hamiltonian formulation of the surface terms. It then is shown how application
to black hole spacetimes connects the boundary degrees of freedom with
thermodynamical properties of black hole physics. Our treatment of the surface
terms thereby naturally leads to the Nernst theorem. Moreover, it will produce
insights into correlations between the Lorentzian and the Euclidean theory.
Next we discuss quantization, which we perform in a standard manner. It is
shown how the thermodynamical properties can be rediscovered from the quantum
equations by a WKB like approximation scheme. Back reaction is treated by going
beyond the first order approximation. We end our discussion by a rigorous
investigation of the so-called BTZ solution in 2+1 dimensional gravity.

phenomenological pion physics admits an interpretation as a low-energy
string-like model associated with QCD. By naive and straightforward
generalization within the context of a new class of supersymmetrical models, it
is shown that this string-like structure admits a 4D, N = 1 supersymmetrical
extension. The presence of a WZNW term in the model implies modifications of
certain higher order processes involving the ordinary SU(3) pion octet.

pion mass vanishes. We find that the deuteron mass is changed little, but that
P--wave nucleon--nucleon scattering volumes are infinite. This motivates an
investigation of the possibilities that there could be a two--nucleon $^3P_0$
bound state, and that the nuclear matter ground state is likely to be a
condensed state of nucleons paired to those quantum numbers. However, the short
distance repulsion in the nucleon--nucleon potential is not affected by the
chiral limit and prevents such new chiral possibilities. Thus the chiral limit
physics of nuclei is very similar to that of nature. Using the chiral limit to
simplify QCD sum rule calculations of nuclear matter properties seems to be a
reasonable approximation.

the pion production mechanism is studied for the reaction $Au+Au$ at 1
GeV/nucleon using the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model. In particular,
the effect of the IDMF on pion spectra and the charged pion ratio are analyzed.
It is found that the inclusion of a IDMF considerably suppresses the low$-p_t$
pions, thus, leading to a better agreement with the data on pion spectra.
Moreover, the rapidity distribution of the charged pion ratio appears to be
sensitive to the isospin dependence of the nuclear mean field.

linear kinetic equations. A set of physically motivated mathematical
requirements is accordingly formulated. We show that it necessarily implies
that solutions of such a kinetic equation in the Heisenberg representation,
define Markov semigroups on the space of observables. Moreover, a general
H-theorem for the adjoint of such semigroups is formulated and proved provided
that at least locally, an invariant measure exists. Under a certain continuity
assumption, the Markov semigroup property is sufficient for a linear kinetic
equation to be a second order differential equation with nonegative-definite
leading coefficient. Conversely it is shown that such equations define Markov
semigroups satisfying an H-theorem, provided there exists a nonnegative
equilibrium solution for their formal adjoint, vanishing at infinity.

a number of direct quantum coding theorems was discovered. To considerable
extent this progress is due to an interplay between the quantum communication
theory and quantum information ideas related to more recent development in
quantum computing. It is remarkable, however, that many probabilistic tools
underlying the treatment of quantum case have their roots, and in some cases
direct prototypes, in classical Shannon's theory. This paper presents an
outline of some basic ideas and results in that direction.
