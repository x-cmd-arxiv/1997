material (stars or gas) at R > 5 disk scale lengths to be ejected in tidal
tails which tend to fall back onto the parent galaxies before the final merger.
Galaxies with massive, low density halos are somewhat more successful at
ejecting tidal debris during mergers, but still have difficulties recreating
the thin, gas-rich tails observed in NGC 7252. Our models suggest upper limits
for the dark halo masses in the NGC 7252 progenitor galaxies of roughly Mh <=
10 Mdb. We note, however, that our calculations have focused on the rather

significant at the 13 sigma level. On the basis of our model for the excitation
of HF in Sgr B2, the observed line equivalent width of 1.0 nm implies a
hydrogen fluoride abundance of 3E-10 relative to H2. If the elemental abundance
of fluorine in Sgr B2 is the same as that in the solar system, then HF accounts
for ~ 2% of the total number of fluorine nuclei. We expect hydrogen fluoride to
be the dominant reservoir of gas-phase fluorine in Sgr B2, because it is formed
rapidly in exothermic reactions of atomic fluorine with either water or
molecular hydrogen; thus the measured HF abundance suggests a substantial
depletion of fluorine onto dust grains. Similar conclusions regarding depletion
have previously been reached for the case of chlorine in dense interstellar
clouds. We also find evidence at a lower level of statistical significance (~ 5
sigma) for an emission feature at the expected position of the 4(3,2)-4(2,3)

variations in the locally measurable value of $H_0$ (denoted as $H_L$),
$\delta_H \equiv (H_L-H_0)/H_0$, which are of order 3-6% (95% confidence
interval) in a sphere of 200$ h^{-1}$Mpc in diameter, and of order 1-2% in a
sphere of 400$ h^{-1}$Mpc in diameter, for three currently viable structure
formation models (tilted CDM, $\Lambda$CDM, and open CDM) as normalized by the
4 year COBE DMR data. However, the true matter distribution power spectrum may
differ from any of the currently viable models. For example, it may contain
sharp features which have escaped detection so far. The measured CMB dipole
velocity (the Galaxy's peculiar velocity with respect to the CMB rest frame)
provides additional constraints on the probability distribution of $\delta_H$
that supplement our limited knowledge of the power spectrum. For a matter power
spectrum which consists of the smooth power spectrum of a viable cosmological
model plus a delta-function bump, we find that given the CMB dipole velocity,
the 95% CL upper limit of $|\delta_H|$ increases approximately by a factor of
two, but the probability distribution of $\delta_H$ is non-Gaussian, with
increased probability at small $\delta_H$ compared to Gaussian. Abandoning
model power spectra entirely, we find that the observed CMB dipole velocity
alone provides a very robust limit, $\sqrt{< \delta_H^2 >_R} <10.5
h^{-1}{Mpc}/R$ at 95% CL, in a sphere of radius $R$, for an arbitrary power
spectrum. Thus, variations between currently available local measures of $H_0$
and its true global value of a few to several percent are to be expected and
differences as large as 10% are possible based on our current knowledge of the
CMB anisotropies.

of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature is believed to probe the
primordial metric perturbations from inflation. Although the perturbations from
inflation are expected to be gaussian random fields, there remains the
possibility that nonlinear processes at later epochs induce ``secondary''
non-gaussian features in the corresponding CMB anisotropy maps. The
non-gaussianity induced by nonlinear gravitational instability of scalar
(density) perturbations has been investigated in existing literature. In this
paper, we highlight another source of non-gaussianity arising out of higher
order scattering of CMB photons off the metric perturbations. We provide a
simple and elegant formalism for deriving the CMB temperature fluctuations
arising due to the Sachs-Wolfe effect beyond the linear order. In particular,
we derive the expression for the second order CMB temperature fluctuations. The
multiple scattering effect pointed out in this paper leads to the possibility
that tensor metric perturbation, i.e., gravity waves (GW) which do not exhibit
gravitational instability can still contribute to the skewness in the CMB
anisotropy maps. We find that in a flat $\Omega =1$ universe, the skewness in
CMB contributed by gravity waves via multiple scattering effect is comparable
to that from the gravitational instability of scalar perturbations for equal
contribution of the gravity waves and scalar perturbations to the total rms CMB
anisotropy. The secondary skewness is found to be smaller than the cosmic
variance leading to the conclusion that inflationary scenarios do predict that
the observed CMB anisotropy should be statistically consistent with a gaussian
random distribution.

imperfectly the volatility correlations and the fat tails of the probability

models by averaging over ensembles of strong interaction S-matrices. The models
range from one with completely random strong interactions, which gives
extensive mixing between physical states, to models with feeble final-state
interactions, characterized by small phase shifts.

studying their tree-level contributions to the process e^+e^- ---> W^+W^-.
However, these couplings also contribute at the loop level to e^+e^- ---> f
fbar processes where `f' is any Standard-Model fermion. In this paper the
available LEP1.5 and LEP2 data, the anticipated LEP2 data and possible linear
collider data for these latter processes is combined with low-energy and Z-pole
data to place indirect constraints on nonstandard WW-photon and WWZ couplings.
The direct and indirect constraints are then compared. An effective Lagrangian
is used to describe the new physics. In order that the implications of this
analysis are as broad as possible, both the light-Higgs scenario, described by
an effective Lagrangian with a linear realization of the symmetry-breaking
sector, and the strongly interacting scenario, described by the electroweak
chiral Lagrangian, are considered.

gauge group are classified by holomorphic charges in addition to the
topological charges familiar from the abelian case. As a result the moduli
spaces of monopoles of given topological charge are stratified according to the
holomorphic charges. Here the physical consequences of the stratification are
explored in the case where the gauge group SU(3) is broken to U(2). The
description due to A. Dancer of the moduli space of charge two monopoles is
reviewed and interpreted physically in terms of non-abelian magnetic dipole
moments. Semi-classical quantisation leads to dyonic states which are labelled
by a magnetic charge and a representation of the subgroup of U(2) which leaves
the magnetic charge invariant (centraliser subgroup). A key result of this
paper is that these states fall into representations of the semi-direct product
$U(2) \semidir R^4$. The combination rules (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients) of
dyonic states can thus be deduced. Electric-magnetic duality properties of the
theory are discussed in the light of our results, and supersymmetric dyonic BPS
states which fill the SL(2,Z)-orbit of the basic massive W-bosons are found.

polarized along their world volume. We show that the absorption cross-section
is determined by the central term in the correlator of two stress-energy
tensors. The existence of a non-renormalization theorem for this central charge
in four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories shows that the
leading term at low energies in the absorption cross-section is not
renormalized. This guarantees that the agreement of the cross-section with
semiclassical supergravity, found in earlier work, survives all loop
corrections. The connection between absorption of gravitons polarized along the
brane and Schwinger terms in the stress-energy correlators of the world volume
theory holds in general. We explore this connection to deduce some properties
of the stress-energy tensor OPE's for 2-branes and 5-branes in 11 dimensions,
as well as for 5-branes in 10 dimensions.

one-parameter family describes a novel dynamics where the monopoles never
separate, but rather, a tetrahedron deforms to its dual. We find a
two-parameter family of SU(5) tetrahedral monopoles and compute some geodesics
in this submanifold numerically. The dynamics is rich, with the monopoles

We have sampled approximately six billion 10% most central Au+Pb interactions

strange quark matter). We thus set upper limits on the production of these
exotic states at the level of 1-6 x 10^{-8} per central collision. These limits
are the best and most model independent for this colliding system. We discuss
the implications of our results on strangelet production mechanisms, and also

We highlight the practical advantages of using a series of entanglement
