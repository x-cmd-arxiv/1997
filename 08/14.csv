similar to the prediction of an inflationary model where an inflaton field is
evolving through a kink in the potential.

  Journal (Mar 1997)",,"10.1086/305104",,"astro-ph",,"  We describe a numerical algorithm which simulates the propagation of light in
inhomogeneous universes, using the multiple lens-plane method. The deformation
and deflection of light beams as they interact with each lens plane are
computed using the filled-beam approximation.
  We use a N-body code to simulate large-scale structure formation in the
universe. We extend the length resolution of the simulations to sub-Megaparsec
scales by using a Monte-Carlo method for locating galaxies according to the
underlying distribution of background matter. The observed galaxy 2-point
correlation function and morphology-density relation are reproduced. This
algorithm constitutes a major improvement over previous methods.
  We test this algorithm for three different CDM models: an Einstein-de Sitter
model, an open model, and a flat model with a nonzero cosmological constant. In
each case, we compute the shear and magnification caused by the presence of
inhomogeneities. Our results are the following: (1) The magnification is
totally dominated by the convergence; the shear contributes less than one part
in 10^4. (2) Most of the cumulative shear and magnification is contributed by
matter located at intermediate redshifts z=1-2. (3) The redshift where the
largest contribution to shear and magnification occurs is model-dependent. (4)
The bulk of the shear and magnification does not originate from direct hits
with galaxies, but rather from the tidal influence of nearby and more distant
galaxies, and background matter. (5) The average contributions of background
matter and nearby galaxies to the shear is comparable for models with small
Omega0. For the Einstein-de Sitter model, the contribution of the background
matter exceeds the one of nearby galaxies by nearly one order of magnitude.

  making) revision at the request of the referee and the discretion of the
  authors",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We propose that galactic shocks propagating through interstellar density
fluctuations provide a mechanism for the intermittent replenishment, or
""pumping,"" of the supersonic motions and internal density enhancements observed
pervasively within cool atomic and molecular interstellar structures, without
necessarily requiring the presence of self-gravity, magnetic fields, or young
stars. The shocks are assumed to be due to a variety of galactic sources on a
range of scales. An analytic result for the kinematic vorticity generated by a
shock passing through a radially-stratified two-dimensional isobaric model
cloud is derived, assuming that the Mach number is not so large that the cloud
is disrupted, and neglecting the shock curvature and cloud distortion.
Two-dimensional lattic gas hydrodynamic simulations at modest Mach numbers were
used to verify the analytic result. The induced internal velocities are
initially a significant fraction of the shock speed divided by the square root
of the density contrast, accounting for both the observed linewidth amplitudes
and the apparent cloud-to-cloud linewidth-density scaling. The linewidth-size
relation could then be interpreted in terms of the well-known power spectrum of
a system of shocks. The induced vortical energy should quickly be converted to
compressible and MHD modes, and so would be difficult to observe directly, even
though it would still be the power source for the other modes. The shockpump
thus produces density structure without the necessity of any sort of
instability. We argue that the shockpump should lead to nested shock-induced
structures, providing a cascade mechanism for supersonic ""turbulence"" and a
physical explanation for the fractal-like structure of the cool interstellar
medium.

crossing times, and likely environments for galaxy-galaxy mergers, and how
galaxies might evolve in these groups, where the collisional effects of the
intra-group gas and the tidal influences of the global potential are weaker
than in rich clusters. We conclude the following. (1) The nine groups with
diffuse X-ray emission (cf. Paper II) are bound systems with at least 20-50
group members. (2) Galaxies in each X-ray-detected group have not all merged
together, because a significant fraction of the group mass lies outside of the
galaxies and in a common halo. (3) Unlike cD galaxies in some rich clusters,
the giant, brightest elliptical in each X-ray group lies in the center of the
group potential, suggesting that such galaxies may form first in poor groups.
(4) In some groups, the fraction and recent star formation histories of the

This galaxy was found to have an exceptionally flat ROSAT spectrum among the

band below 2 keV, which partly accounts for the flat spectrum observed with the
ROSAT PSPC. The absorption is mainly due to cold gas with a column density of
(2-3)E21 cm-2. A reanalysis of the PSPC data indicates that the absorber is
slightly ionized, covers only part of the central source, or there is extra
soft thermal emission from an extended region. There is also evidence that the
X-ray absorption is complex; an edge feature marginally detected at 0.84 keV
suggests the presence of an additional high ionization absorber which imposes a
strong OVIII edge on the spectrum. After correction for the absorption, the
photon index of the intrinsic continuum, 1.8, obtained from the ASCA data is
quite similar to that of ordinary Seyfert 1 galaxies. Mrk 507 still has one of

lensing clusters to exploit the amplification of all background sources by the

per sq. degree is found to a 50% completeness limit of ~4 mJy at 850-um. The
sub-mm spectral properties of these sources indicate that the majority lie at
high redshift, z>1. Without correcting for lens amplification, our observations
limit the blank-field counts at this depth. The surface density is 3 orders of
magnitude greater than the expectation of a non-evolving ber density of
strongly star-forming galaxies in the high-redshift Universe and suggest that
optical surveys may have substantial underestimated the star formation density

multiple realizations of mock catalogs drawn from a simulation that mimics the

in the mildly nonlinear regime and a linear biasing relation between galaxies

combining the results to obtain the phase behavior of a system over a range of
temperatures and densities. Critical parameters were determined from
mixed-field finite-size scaling concepts by matching the order parameter
distribution near the critical point to the distribution for the
three-dimensional Ising universality class. Calculations for the simple cubic
lattice (coordination number z=6) and for a high coordination number version of
the same lattice (z=26) were performed for chain lengths significantly longer
than in previous simulation studies. The critical temperature was found to
scale with chain length following the Flory-Huggins functional form. For the
z=6 lattice, the extrapolated infinite chain length critical temperature is
3.70+-0.01, in excellent agreement with previous calculations of the
temperature at which the osmotic second virial coefficient is zero and the mean
end-to-end distance proportional to the number of bonds. This confirms that the
three alternative definitions of the Theta-temperature are equivalent in the
limit of long chains. The critical volume fraction scales with chain length
with an exponent equal to 0.38+-0.01, in agreement with experimental data but
in disagreement with polymer solution theories. The width of the coexistence
curve prefactor was tentatively found to scale with chain length with an

  if the text height or width is changed. To appear in `Self-Sustaining
  Mechanisms of Wall Turbulence', ed. R. L. Panton, Comp. Mech. Pub., 1997",,,,"physics.flu-dyn chao-dyn cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.CD",,"  We argue that important elements of the dynamics of wall-bounded flows reside
at the wall-normal position $y_p^+$ corresponding to the peak of the Reynolds
shear stress. Specializing to pipe and channel flows, we show that the mean
momentum balance in the neighborhood of $y_p^+$ is distinct in character from
those in the classical inner and outer layers. We revisit empirical data to
confirm that $y_p^+ = O(R^{1/2})$ and show that, in a neighborhood of order
$R^{1/2}$ around $y_p^+$, only the viscous effects balance pressure-gradient
terms. Here, R is the Reynolds number based on friction velocity and pipe
radius (or channel half-width). This observation provides a mechanism by which
viscous effects play an important role in regions traditionally thought to be
inviscid or inertial; in particular, it throws doubt on the validity of the
classical matching principle. Even so, it is shown that the classical
semi-logarithmic behavior for the mean velocity distribution can be a useful
approximation. It is argued that the recently advanced power-law profiles
possess a rich underlying structure, and could be good approximations to the
data over an extended region (but they too are unlikely to be exact).

roles that causality plays in the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations. We
investigate a small perturbing impulse acting on the ground state of an
infinitely deep square well. For the two representations, the first-order
perturbation calculations for the temporal change in energy differ. This
temporal change in energy for the trajectory representation is dependent upon
the microstate of the wave function. We show that even under Copenhagen
epistemology, the two representations predict different theoretical results.

general expected to be elements of a Grassmann algebra, is emphasized. Several
examples with first- and second-class constraints are discussed.

N-soliton pulse trains of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, we predict
the asymptotic behavior of these trains. The following asymptotic regimes are
stable: (i)~asymptotically free propagation of all N solitons; (ii)~bound state
regime where the N solitons may move quasi-equidistantly (QED); and
(iii)~various different combinations of (i) and (ii). For N=2 and 3 we
determine analytically the set of initial soliton parameters corresponding to
each of these regimes. We find excellent agreement between the solutions of CTC
and NLS for all regimes and propose realistic choices for the sets of
amplitudes, for which the solitons propagate QED to very large run lengths.
This is of importance for optical fiber communication.

subalgebra. The simplest cases are discussed in detail. In particular, it is
proved that the supersymmetric two-boson hierarchy is one of N=2 supersymmetric
KdV hierarchies. Also, a Lax operator is supplied for one of N=2 supersymmetric
Boussinesq hierarchies.
