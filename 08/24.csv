Observatory Sky Survey (DPOSS) represents a major technical challenge. The
input data set consists of 3 Terabytes of pixel information, and contains a few
billion sources. We describe some of the specific scientific problems posed by
the data, including searches for distant quasars and clusters of galaxies, and
the data-mining techniques we are exploring in addressing them.
Machine-assisted discovery methods may become essential for the analysis of
such multi-Terabyte data sets. New and future approaches involve unsupervised
classification and clustering analysis in the Giga-object data space, including
various Bayesian techniques. In addition to the searches for known types of
objects in this data base, these techniques may also offer the possibility of
discovering previously unknown, rare types of astronomical objects.

discovered in the dwarf galaxy UGC 7636 which is located 5'.5 southeast of the
giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4472, the brightest galaxy in the Virgo cluster.
Several lines of evidence indicate that UGC 7636 is interacting violently with
NGC 4472. These objects are very blue with colors of -0.4 < (C-T1) < 0.6, and
their magnitudes are in the range of 20.6 < T1 < 22.9 mag which corresponds to
absolute magnitudes of -10.6 < M(T1) < -8.3 mag for a distance modulus of
(m-M)o = 31.2. These objects are grouped spatially in three regions: the
central region of UGC 7636, the tidal tail region, and the HI cloud region. No
such objects were found in the counter tail region. It is concluded that these
objects are probably young star clusters which formed < 0.1Gyr ago during the
interaction between UGC 7636 and NGC 4472. Surface photometry of UGC 7636 (r <
83"") shows that there is a significant excess of blue light along the tidal
tail region compared with other regions. The star clusters are bluer than the
stellar light in the tidal tail region, indicating that these clusters might
have formed later than most stars in the tidal tail region which were formed
later than most stars in the main body of the galaxy.

configuration of a generalized electro-magnetic n-form F and a dilatonic scalar
field, admitting an interpretation in terms of intersecting p-branes. For
theories with multiple times, selection rules are obtained, which obstruct the
existence of p-branes in certain subspaces. General static solutions are
obtained under a specific restriction on the model parameters, which
corresponds to the known ""intersection rules"". More special families of
solutions (with equal charges for some of the F-field components) are found
with weakened restrictions on the input parameters. Black-hole solutions are
determined, and it is shown that in the extreme limit the Hawking temperature
may tend to zero, a finite value, or infinity, depending on the p-brane
intersection dimension. A kind of no-hair theorem is obtained, claiming that
black holes cannot coexist with a quasiscalar component of the F-field.

equipped with a natural partial order related to the isotony property. Assuming
the underlying manifold of the net to be a differentiable, this net shall be
kinematically covariant under general diffeomorphisms. However, the dynamical
relations, induced by the physical state defining the related net of (von
Neumann) observables, are in general not covariant under all diffeomorphisms,
but only under the subgroup of dynamical symmetries.
  We introduce algebraically both, IR and UV cutoffs, and assume that these are
related by a commutant duality. The latter, having strong implications on the
net, allows us to identify a 1-parameter group of the dynamical symmetries with
the group of outer modular automorphisms.
  For thermal equilibrium states, the modular dilation parameter may be used
locally to define the notions of both, time and a causal structure.

that the resulting calculus is covariant under a three-parameter group which
