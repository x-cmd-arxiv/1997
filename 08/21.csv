the resolution this high. We present two new halo finding algorithms developed

  ApJ Lett",,"10.1086/310936",,"astro-ph",,"  Dramatic torque reversals between spin up and spin down have been observed in
half of the persistent X-ray pulsars monitored by the BATSE all-sky monitor on
CGRO. Theoretical models developed to explain early pulsar timing data can
explain spin down torques via a disk-magnetosphere interaction if the star
nearly corotates with the inner accretion disk. To produce the observed BATSE
torque reversals, however, these equilibrium models require the disk to
alternate between two mass accretion rates, with $\dot M_{\pm}$ producing
accretion torques of similar magnitude, but always of opposite sign. Moreover,
in at least one pulsar (GX 1+4) undergoing secular spin down the neutron star
spins down faster during brief ($\sim 20$ day) hard X-ray flares -- this is
opposite the correlation expected from standard theory, assuming BATSE pulsed
flux increases with mass accretion rate. The $10$ day to 10 yr intervals
between torque reversals in these systems are much longer than any
characteristic magnetic or viscous time scale near the inner disk boundary and
are more suggestive of a global disk phenomenon.
  We discuss possible explanations of the observed torque behavior. Despite the
preferred sense of rotation defined by the binary orbit, the BATSE observations
are surprisingly consistent with an earlier suggestion by Makishima \etal
(1988) for GX~1+4: the disks in these systems somehow alternate between
episodes of prograde and retrograde rotation. We are unaware of any mechanism
that could produce a stable retrograde disk in a binary undergoing Roche-lobe
overflow, but such flip-flop behavior does occur in numerical simulations of
wind-fed systems. One possibility is that the disks in some of these binaries
are fed by an X-ray excited wind.

periodicities in the light curve: 0.2558 d, 0.06005 d and 0.079 d, with
peak-to-peak amplitudes of about 0.012, 0.014 and 0.007 mag. respectively.

after the outburst of the nova, accretion processes are taking place in this
stellar system. Matter is being transferred from the cool component, most
likely through an accretion disc and via accretion columns on to the magnetic

unabsorbed objects, with column densities up to 4e21 cm-2. Although the
distribution of the [OIII] EW for the RIXOS AGN is typical of optically
selected samples, the Balmer line EWs are relatively low. This is consistent
with the presence of a dust absorber between the broad and narrow line regions
(eg. a molecular torus), and intrinsically weak optical line emission. We find
Baldwin effects in CIII] and MgII, and a positive response of the MgII line to
its ionizing continuum. There is a strong correlation between the EW and FWHM
of MgII, which may be similar to that seen in other samples for Hbeta. We
demonstrate that this is consistent with models which suggest two line-emitting
zones, a `very broad line region' (VBLR) and an `intermediate line region'
(ILR). The correlation between EW and FWHM in MgII may be a physical
characteristic of the ILR or it may reflect a geometric dependence. We found no
correlation between the Hbeta FWHM and the slope of the X-ray spectrum, however
this may be due to the effects of dust absorption which suppresses the broad
Hbeta component, masking any relationship. The Halpha FWHM does tend to be
narrow when alpha_X is soft, and broadens as alpha_X hardens, although the
formal probability for this correlation is low (91 per cent). If the
distribution of alpha_X in the RIXOS sample reflects the level of intrinsic
absorption in these AGN, the data suggest a possible link between the velocity
of the Balmer line-emitting region and the amount of absorbing material beyond.

pressure was studied using hot-filament chemical vapor deposition. Very high
nucleation rates and densities (10^8-10^{10} cm^{-2}) were obtained under 1
torr, which were 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than the counterpart (10^7
cm^{-2}) under conventionally low pressure (tens of torr). The effects of
substrate temperature and methane concentration under very low pressure were
also investigated, revealing that, overly high substrate temperature leads to a
relatively low nucleation density, and that higher CH_4 concentration gives
rise to a higher density and a higher rate. The nucleation mechanism is
discussed in detail. While a large amount of atomic hydrogen creates nucleating
sites, sufficient supersaturation of carbon and/or hydrocarbon species on/near
the substrate surface is the key factor for nucleation, in competition against
the rapid formation of carbide. Very low pressure leads to long mean free path
and other benefiting effects, and hence, is critical for rapid, high-density
nucleation. Effects of substrate temperature and CH_4 concentration are also

conformations under tension from a classical random walk to a problem we call
the `torsional directed walk'. Motivated by a recent experiment on single
lambda-DNA molecules [Strick et al., Science 271 (1996) 1835], we formulate the
torsional directed walk problem and solve it analytically in the appropriate
force regime. Our technique affords a direct physical determination of the
microscopic twist stiffness C and twist-stretch coupling D relevant for DNA
functionality. The theory quantitatively fits existing experimental data for
relative extension as a function of overtwist over a wide range of applied
force; fitting to the experimental data yields the numerical values C=120nm and
D=50nm. Future experiments will refine these values. We also predict that the
phenomenon of reduction of effective twist stiffness by bend fluctuations
should be testable in future single-molecule experiments, and we give its
analytic form.

quantum field theory on the Euclidean section. Boundary conditions emerge
naturally as consistency conditions of the Kruskal extension. We carry out the
proposal for the explicit case of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter manifold with two
horizons. The required period $\beta$ is the interesting condition that it is
the lowest common multiple of $2\pi$ divided by the surface gravity of both
horizons. Restricting the ratio of the surface gravity of the horizons to
rational numbers yields finite $\beta$. The example also highlights some of the
difficulties of the off-shell approach with conical singularities in the
multihorizon scenario; and serves to illustrate the much richer interplay that
can occur among horizons, quantum field theory and topology when the
cosmological constant is not neglected in black hole processes.

finite even in the zero-mass case. In 3 dimensions a residual effect of the
resummed infrared divergences is that at low temperature or strong coupling the
leading term in the interaction pressure becomes independent of the coupling
and is 4/5 of the free-field pressure. In 4 dimensions the pressure is
well-defined provided that the temperature is below the tachyon mass. We
examine how rapidly this expansion converges and use our analysis to suggest
how one might reorganise perturbation theory to improve the calculation of the

plausible explanations for various properties of the Standard Model which
include the natural appearance of three generations, the explanation of the
heavy top quark mass and the qualitative structure of the fermion mass spectrum
in general, the stability of the proton and more. These intriguing achievements
makes evident the need to understand the general space of these models. While
the number of possibilities is large, general patterns can be extracted. In
this paper I present a detailed discussion on the construction of the realistic
free fermionic models with the aim of providing some insight into the basic
structures and building blocks that enter the construction. The role of free
phases in the determination of the phenomenology of the models is discussed in
detail. I discuss the connection between the free phases and mirror symmetry in
(2,2) models and the corresponding symmetries in the case of the (2,0) models.
The importance of the free phases in determining the effective low energy
phenomenology is illustrated in several examples. The classification of the
models in terms of boundary condition selection rules, real world-sheet fermion
pairings, exotic matter states and the hidden sector is discussed.

  Matrices",,,,"MSRI 1997-086","math.RT math.PR",,"  Let $n$ particles move in standard Brownian motion in one dimension, with the
process terminating if two particles collide. This is a specific case of
Brownian motion constrained to stay inside a Weyl chamber; the Weyl group for
this chamber is $A_{n-1}$, the symmetric group. For any starting positions, we
compute a determinant formula for the density function for the particles to be
at specified positions at time $t$ without having collided by time $t$. We show
that the probability that there will be no collision up to time $t$ is
asymptotic to a constant multiple of $t^{-n(n-1)/4}$ as $t$ goes to infinity,
and compute the constant as a polynomial of the starting positions. We have
analogous results for the other classical Weyl groups; for example, the
hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ gives a model of $n$ independent particles with a
wall at $x=0$.
  We can define Brownian motion on a Lie algebra, viewing it as a vector space;
the eigenvalues of a point in the Lie algebra correspond to a point in the Weyl
chamber, giving a Brownian motion conditioned never to exit the chamber. If
there are $m$ roots in $n$ dimensions, this shows that the radial part of the
conditioned process is the same as the $n+2m$-dimensional Bessel process. The
conditioned process also gives physical models, generalizing Dyson's model for
$A_{n-1}$ corresponding to ${\mathfrak s}{\mathfrak u}_n$ of $n$ particles
moving in a diffusion with a repelling force between two particles proportional
to the inverse of the distance between them.

subsystem by carefully considering the relevant time and length scales over
which one must consider the effects of phase interference between alternative
histories of the classical subsystem. Such alternative histories are an
integral part of any quantum-classical computational scheme which employ
transitions between discrete quantum states; consequently, the coherences
between alternative histories have a profound effect on the transition
probability between quantum states. In this paper, we review the Bittner-Rossky

molecular dynamics simulations which implements this theory. Application of the
