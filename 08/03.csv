parameter h_o = 0.70+-0.15, age of the universe t_o = 14+7-2 Gyr, cluster gas
fraction f_o \equiv f_G h^{3/2} = 0.060 +- 0.006, and effective shape parameter
Gamma_o = 0.255 +- 0.017. Errors quoted are 1 sigma, and we assume Gaussian
statistics. We experiment with a fifth constraint Omega_o = 0.2 +- 0.1 from
clusters. We set the tilt parameter n = 1 and the gas enhancement factor
Upsilon = 0.9. We consider CDM models (open and Omega_M = 1) and flat LambdaCDM
models. We test goodness of fit and draw confidence regions by the Delta chi^2
method. CDM models with Omega_M = 1 (SCDM models) are accepted only because the
large error on h_o allows h < 0.5. Baryonic matter plays a significant role in
Gamma_o when Omega_M \sim 1. Open CDM models are accepted only for Omega_M
\gtrsim 0.4. The combination of the four other constraints with Omega_o = 0.2
+- 0.1 is rejected in CDM models with 98% confidence, suggesting that light may
not trace mass. LambdaCDM models give similar results. In all of these models,
eta_{10} \gtrsim 6 is favored strongly over eta_{10} \lesssim 2. This suggests
that reports of low deuterium abundances on QSO lines of sight may be correct
and that observational determinations of primordial 4He may have systematic
errors. Plausible variations on n and Upsilon in our models do not change the
results much. If we drop or change the crucial Gamma_o constraint, lower values
of Omega_M and eta_{10} are permitted. The constraint Gamma_o = 0.15 +- 0.04,
derived recently from the IRAS redshift survey, favors Omega_M \approx 0.3 and
eta_{10} \approx 5 but does not exclude eta_{10} \approx 2.

magnitude of {\cal A}_{SL} up to the percent level within the appropriate
parameter space. So measurements of {\cal A}_{SL} and its correlation with
other CP asymmetries will serve as a sensitive probe for new physics in
B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d mixing.

Hamiltonian containing charmed currents have been recently studied.
Penguin-like contractions of these operators, denoted as charming penguins,
have been shown to be relevant for several B decays into two pseudoscalar
mesons. In particular, they are expected to give large enhancements to
processes which would be otherwise Cabibbo suppressed. Their contributions
easily lead to values of BR(B^+ \to K^0 \pi^+) and BR(B_d \to K^+ \pi^-) of
about 1 \times 10^{-5}, as recently found by the CLEO collaboration. In this
paper, we show that such large branching fractions cannot be obtained without
charming penguins. This holds true irrespectively of the model used to compute
the non-leptonic amplitudes and of the relevant parameters of the CKM mixing
matrix. We use the experimental measurements of the B^+ \to K^0 \pi^+ and B_d
\to K^+ \pi^- decay rates to constrain the charming-penguin amplitudes and to
predict BRs for a large set of other two-body decay channels where their
contributions are also important. These include several pseudoscalar-vector and
vector-vector channels, such as B \to \rho K and B \to \rho K^*, which have not
been measured yet.

5-form charge is entirely due to the Wess-Zumino term because the `naive'
algebra is the M-2-brane supertranslation algebra. The full structure of
central charges is shown to be directly related to the projector arising in the
proof of $\kappa$-symmetry of the M-5-brane action. It is also shown to allow
`mixed' M-brane configurations preserving 1/2 supersymmetry that include the
(non-marginal) M-2-brane/M-5-brane `bound state' as a special case.
