spectrum differs from that of the underlying mass distribution. The degree of
bias is always a monotonic function of scale, tending to an asymptotic value on
scales where the density fluctuations are linear. The scale dependence is often
rather weak, with many reasonable prescriptions giving a bias which is nearly
independent of scale. We have investigated whether such an Eulerian bias can
reconcile a range of theoretical power spectra with the twin requirements of
fitting the galaxy power spectrum and reproducing the observed mass-to-light
ratios in clusters. It is not possible to satisfy these constraints for any

biases. The optical-IR colors of the early-type cluster galaxies become bluer
with increasing redshift in a manner consistent with the passive evolution of
an old stellar population formed at an early cosmic epoch. The degree of color
evolution is similar for clusters at similar redshift, and does not depend
strongly on the optical richness or X-ray luminosity of the cluster, suggesting
that the history of early-type galaxies is relatively insensitive to
environment. The slope of the color-magnitude relationship shows no significant

between galaxy mass and metallicity, not age. Finally, the intrinsic scatter in

that the majority of giant, early-type galaxies in clusters share a common star
formation history, with little perturbation due to uncorrelated episodes of

cannot be produced by diffusive acceleration at a simple nonrelativistic shock
front propagating in a homogeneous medium. It can, however, be produced by a
single unmodified mildly relativistic shock, if the pressure in the shocked gas
is provided by the leptonic component, or, independently of the equation of

acceleration in a tangled magnetic field. Here, however, the Monte-Carlo

describe some low dimensional strongly correlated systems is discussed. This is
linked to the need for a correlated basis, in which the ground state may be
postive definite, and in which single particle correlations may suffice. A
particular trial basis is proposed, and applied to a certain quasi-1D model.
The model is a strip of the 2D square lattice wrapped around a cylinder, and is
related to the ladder geometries, but with periodic instead of open boundary
conditions along the edges. Analysis involves a novel mean-field approach and
exact diagonalisation. The model has a paramagnetic region and a Nagaoka
ferromagnetic region. The proposed basis is well suited to the model, and
single particle correlations in it have power law decay for the paramagnet,
where the charge motion is qualitatively hard core bosonic. The mean field also
leads to a BCS-type model with single particle long range order.

the atomic size of the impurity we find that new local states are predominated
by long-wavelength polaritons. The properties of these states are shown to be
different from the properties of the well-known vibrational local states. The
difference is due to the singular behavior of the density of states of
polaritons near the low-frequency boundary of the polariton gap. Assuming cubic

Using the freedom in choosing bases of right-chiral fields in the minimal
standard model, reduction to triangular form reduces the well-known ambiguities
in reconstructing a mass matrix to trivial phase redefinitions. Furthermore,
diagonalization of the quark mass sectors can be shifted to one charge sector
only, without loosing the concise and economic triangular form. The
corresponding effective triangular mass matrix is reconstructed, up to trivial
phases, from the moduli of the CKM matrix elements, and vice versa, in a unique
way. A new formula for the parametrization independent CP-measure in terms of
observables is derived and discussed.

Our investigation in fact shows that while most probes living in such a

they couple to both the metric and the scalar field, in a way which effectively
forces them to move along null geodesics of the Einstein conformal frame. Since
the metric of the Einstein conformal frame is always singular for
configurations where matter satisfies the energy conditions, the gravity wave
world lines are past inextendable beyond the Einstein frame singularity, and
hence the geometry is still incomplete, and thus singular. We conclude that the
singularity cannot be entirely removed, but only be made invisible to most, but
not all, probes in the theory.

affect the in medium spectral function of the rho strongly. In the transverse

excitation of the vacuum. Instead, our model shows a continuum of possible

calculation. As a consequence of the self-consistent treatment we also find a
strong enhancement of the widths of the included nucleon resonances in medium.
