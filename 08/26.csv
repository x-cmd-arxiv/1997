history of the universe at ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelengths
is modeled from the present epoch to z~4 by tracing the evolution with cosmic
time of the galaxy luminosity density, as determined from several deep
spectroscopic samples and the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) imaging survey. The
global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies can be well fit by a
simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent star formation rate
(SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal IMF extending from 0.1 to 125
M_sun. In the best-fit models, the global SFR rises sharply, by about an order
of magnitude, from a redshift of zero to a peak value at z~1.5, to fall again
at higher redshifts. The models are able to account for the entire background
light recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels
probed by the HDF. Since only 20% of the current stellar content of galaxies is
produced at z>2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is expected at these early
times, in good agreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped
Lyman-\alpha systems. A ``monolithic collapse'' model, where half of the
present-day stars formed at z>2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made
consistent with the global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass
density at high redshifts as sampled by QSO absorbers.

are also observed in Seyfert-1 galaxies. This result is contrary to unification

observed edge-on. This raises some questions as to the orientation of the
circumnuclear absorber. If the observed differences between Seyfert type-1 and

rotation curves without the need for copious amounts of dark matter. To check
the viability of Weyl gravity, we propose two additional classical tests of the
theory: the deflection of light and time delay in the exterior of a static
spherically symmetric source. The result for the deflection of light is
remarkably simple: besides the usual positive (attractive) Einstein deflection
of $4GM/r_{0}$ we obtain an extra deflection term of $-\gamma r_{0}$ where
$\gamma$ is a constant and $r_0$ is the radius of closest approach. With a
negative $\gamma$, the extra term can increase the deflection on large distance
scales (galactic or greater) and therefore imitate the effect of dark matter.
Notably, the negative sign required for $\gamma$ is opposite to the sign of
$\gamma$ used to fit galactic rotation curves. The experimental constraints
show explicitly that the magnitude of $\gamma$ is of the order of the inverse
Hubble length something already noted by Mannheim and Kazanas as an interesting
numerical coincidence in the fitting of galactic rotation curves.

cosmological standard rods using the Fundamental Plane relation combined with a
correction for luminosity evolution. Though cluster ellipticals certainly
formed in a complex way, their passive evolution out to redshifts of about 1
indicates that basically all major merging and accretion events took place at
higher redshifts. Therefore, a calibration of their luminosity evolution can be
attempted. We propose to use the Mg$-\sigma$ relation for that purpose because
it is independent of distance and cosmology. We discuss a variety of possible
caveats, ranging from dynamical evolution to uncertainties in stellar
population models and evolution corrections to the presence of age spread.
Sources of major random and systematic errors are analysed as well. We apply
the described procedure to nine elliptical galaxies in two clusters at
$z=0.375$ and derive constraints on the cosmological model. For the best
fitting $\Lambda$-free cosmological model we obtain: $q_o \approx 0.1$, with
90% confidence limits being $0 < q_o < 0.7$ (the lower limit being due to the
presence of matter in the Universe). If the inflationary scenario applies (i.e.
the Universe has flat geometry), then, for the best fitting model, matter and
$\Lambda$ contribute about equally to the critical cosmic density (i.e.
$\Omega_m \approx \Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.5$). With 90% confidence
$\Omega_\Lambda$ should be smaller than 0.9.

inelastic, inclusive electron scattering off nuclei, is extended to the
treatment of exclusive processes. The final states interaction is accounted for
in the mean field approximation, respecting the Pauli principle. The impact on
the exclusive cross section of the shape of the potential binding the nucleons
into the nucleus and of the distortion of the outgoing nucleon wave are
explored. The exclusive scattering is found to be quite sensitive to the mean
field final states interaction, unlike the inclusive one. Indeed we verify that
the latter is not affected, as implied by unitarity, by the distortion of the
outgoing nucleon wave except for the effect of relativity, which is modest in
the range of momenta up to about 500 MeV/c. Furthermore, depending upon the
correlations between the directions of the outgoing and of the initial nucleon,
the exclusive cross-section turns out to be remarkably sensitive to the shape
of the potential binding the nucleons. These correlations also critically
affect the domain in the missing energy-- missing momentum plane where the
exclusive process occurs.

  19 - 26, 1997 ; 6 pages, LaTex",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  If textbook Lorentz invariance is actually a property of the equations
describing a sector of the excitations of vacuum above some critical distance
scale, several sectors of matter with different critical speeds in vacuum can
coexist and an absolute rest frame (the vacuum rest frame) may exist without
contradicting the apparent Lorentz invariance felt by ""ordinary"" particles
(particles with critical speed in vacuum equal to $c$, the speed of light).
Sectorial Lorentz invariance, reflected by the fact that all particles of a
given dynamical sector have the same critical speed in vacuum, will then be an
expression of a fundamental sectorial symmetry (e.g. preonic grand unification
or extended supersymmetry) protecting a parameter of the equations of motion.
Furthermore, the sectorial Lorentz symmetry may be only a low-energy limit, in
the same way as the relation $\omega $ (frequency) = $c_s$ (speed of sound) $k$
(wave vector) holds for low-energy phonons in a crystal. In this context,
phenomena such as the absence of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff and the
stability of unstable particles at very high energy are basic properties of a
wide class of noncausal models where local Lorentz invariance is broken
introducing a fundamental length. Observable phenomena from Lorentz symmetry
violation and superluminal sectors of matter are expected at very short
wavelength scales, even if Lorentz symmetry violation remains invisible to
standard low-energy tests. We discuss signatures of this new physics at LHC and
at other possible future colliders.

superluminal propagation of initially localized particles and dependence of
spatial localization on the motion of the observer, are analyzed in the context
of Dirac's theory of constraints. A parametrization invariant formulation is
obtained by introducing time and energy operators for the relativistic particle
and then treating the Klein-Gordon equation as a constraint. The standard,
physical Hilbert space is recovered, via integration over proper time, from an
augmented Hilbert space wherein time and energy are dynamical variables. It is
shown that the Newton-Wigner position operator, being in this description a
constant of motion, acts on states in the augmented space. States with strictly
positive energy are non-local in time; consequently, position measurements
receive contributions from states representing the particle's position at many
times. Apparent superluminal propagation is explained by noting that, as the
particle is potentially in the past (or future) of the assumed initial place
and time of localization, it has time to propagate to distant regions without
exceeding the speed of light. An inequality is proven showing the Hegerfeldt
paradox to be completely accounted for by the hypotheses of subluminal
propagation from a set of initial space-time points determined by the quantum
time distribution arising from the positivity of the system's energy. Spatial
localization can nevertheless occur through quantum interference between states
representing the particle at different times. The non-locality of the same
system to a moving observer is due to Lorentz rotation of spatial axes out of
the interference minimum.
