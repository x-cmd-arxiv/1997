  Astronomy and Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the soft X-ray spectra and light curves observed with the ROSAT
and EUVE from the closest known millisecond pulsar J0437--4715 can be
interpreted as thermal radiation from two hot polar caps whose emitting layers
(atmospheres) are comprised of hydrogen. The simplest model yields a uniform
temperature of $(0.8-0.9)\times 10^6 K$ within a cap radius of $0.7-0.9 km$.
The spectral fits indicate that the temperature may be nonuniformly distributed
along the cap surface. The distribution can be approximated by a central core
heated up to $(1-2)\times 10^6 K$ within a radius of $0.2-0.4 km$, surrounded
by a colder rim with temperatures $(3-5)\times 10^5 K$ extending out to $2-6
km$. The polar cap interpretation implies low column densities, $(1-3)\times
10^{19} cm^{-2}$, and a high degree of ionization, $> 20$%, of the interstellar
hydrogen towards the pulsar. The inferred bolometric luminosity of the polar
caps, $(1.0-1.6)\times 10^{30} erg s^{-1}$, is in excellent agreement with the
predictions of the slot-gap model of radio pulsars developed by Arons and his
coworkers. Similar polar cap radiation should be emitted by other millisecond
pulsars, although in some of them (e.~g., PSR B1821--24) the soft X-ray flux is
dominated by the nonthermal radiation from pulsar magnetospheres.

long-slit spectra for a sample of the nearest and brightest late-type galaxies
to study the morphology, physical state, and kinematics of the `Diffuse Ionized
Medium' (`DIM'). We find that the DIM covers most of the star-forming disk, and
is morphologically related to the presence of the giant HII regions. In
addition, the DIM and the giant HII regions differ systematically in their
physical and dynamical state. The DIM is characterized by enhanced emission in
the low-ionization forbidden lines ([OI], [NII], and [SII]), and even the
high-ionization [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line is moderately strong in the DIM. We
verify the inference made by Lehnert & Heckman that the DIM contributes
significantly to the global emission-line ratios measured in late-type
galaxies. We also find that the DIM is more disturbed kinematically than the
gas in the giant HII regions. The intrinsic FWHMs of the H$\alpha$ and
[NII]$\lambda$6584 lines range from 30 to 100 km s$^{-1}$ in the DIM compared
to 20-50 km s$^{-1}$ in HII regions. The high-ionization gas in the DIM is even
more kinematically disturbed than the low-ionization gas: the
[OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines have intrinsic FWHMs of 70-150 km s$^{-1}$. The
differing kinematics implies that `the DIM' is not a single monolithic phase of
the ISM. Instead, it may consist of a `quiescent DIM' with a low
ionization-state and small scale-height (few hundred pc) and a `disturbed DIM'
with a high ionization state and moderate scale-height (0.5 to 1 kpc). We argue
that the quiescent DIM is most likely photoionized by radiation leaking out of
giant HII regions, while the disturbed DIM is most likely heated by the
mechanical energy supplied by supernovae and stellar winds.

population of objects at z = 3 with many of the characteristics which we expect
for primeval galaxies, and emphasize in particular the advantages of a colour
selection technique which targets the Lyman discontinuity at 912 Angstroms.
Star forming galaxies at z = 3 resemble local starbursts, although they are
typically more luminous by more than one order of magnitude. The ultraviolet
continuum is dominated by the integrated light of O and early B type stars and
shows prominent interstellar absorption lines which are often blueshifted
relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy, indicating highly energetic
outflows in the interstellar medium. Lyman alpha emission is generally weak,
probably as a result of resonant scattering. The spectral slope of the
ultraviolet continuum and the strength of the Hbeta emission line, which we
have detected in a few cases with pilot observations in the infrared K band,
suggest that some interstellar dust is already present in these young galaxies
and that it attenuates their UV luminosities by a factor of about 3. The
efficiency of our photometric selection technique has allowed us to establish
that large scale concentrations of galaxies were already in place at z = 3,
possibly the precursors of galaxy clusters as they as they were beginning to
decouple from the Hubble expansion. In the context of Cold Dark Matter models
of structure formation, the observed clustering of the z~3 galaxies suggests
that they are associated with dark matter halos of mass greater than 10^12
solar masses. We conclude by pointing out the need for infrared space
observatories, such as the proposed Next Generation Space Telescope, for
pushing the quest for the origin of galaxies beyond z=5.

for cosmology. It has been shown by Oukbir and Blanchard (1997) that the
combined knowledge of the redshift distribution of X-ray clusters of galaxies
and the luminosity-temperature correlation, $L_X-T_X$, provides a powerful test
of the mean density of the Universe. In this paper, we address the question of
the possible evolution of this relation from an observational point of view and
its cosmological significance. We introduce a new indicator in order to measure
the evolution of the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation with redshift and
take advantage of the recent availability of temperature information for a
significant number of high and intermediate redshift X-ray clusters of
galaxies. From our analysis, we find a slightly positive evolution in the
$L_X-T_X$ relation. This implies a high value of the density parameter of
$0.85\pm0.2 $. However, because the selection of clusters included inour sample
is unknown, this can be considered only as a tentative result. A
well-controlled X-ray selected survey would provide a more robust answer. XMM
will be ideal for such a program.

mass of galaxy clusters is inferred from gravitational shear. The method
utilizes high-redshift standard candles that undergo weak lensing. Natural
candidates for such standard candles are type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). When
corrected with the light-curve shape (LCS), the peak magnitude of SN Ia
provides a standard candle with an uncertainty in apparent magnitude of $\Delta
m\simeq 0.1-0.2$. Gravitational magnification of a background SN Ia by an
intervening cluster would cause a mismatch between the observed SN Ia peak
magnitude compared to that expected from its LCS and redshift. The average
detection rate for SN Ia with a significant mismatch of $\ge2\Delta m$ behind a
cluster at $z\simeq0.05-0.15$ is about $1-2$ supernovae per cluster per year at
$J,I,R\lesssim25-26$. Since SNe are point-like sources for a limited period,
they can experience significant microlensing by MACHOs in the intracluster
medium. Microlensing events caused by MACHOs of $\sim10^{-4} M_\odot$ are
expected to have time scales similar to that of the SN light curve. Both the
magnification curve by a MACHO and the light curve of a SN Ia have
characteristic shapes that allow to separate them. Microlensing events due to
MACHOs of smaller mass can unambiguously be identified in the SN light curve if
the latter is continuously monitored. The average number of identifiable
microlensing events per nearby cluster ($z\lesssim0.05$) per year is $\sim 0.02

general theory of this effect combined with the ansatz describing the
non-linear evolution of clustering in simulations enables us to estimate the
magnitude of the correction factor in different cosmologies. In a series of
numerical calculations assuming an array of cold dark matter models, it is
found that, as long as galaxies are unbiased tracers of underlying density
field, the effect is relatively small ($ \simeq 10%$) for the shallow surveys
($z <0.2$), while it becomes significant (order of unity) in deep surveys ($z
\sim1$). Depending on the scales of interest, the required correction is
comparable to or smaller than the expected errors of on-going wide-field galaxy
surveys such as the SDSS and 2dF.
  Therefore at present, the effect has to be taken into account for high
precision measurements at very small scales only, while in future deep surveys
it amounts to a significant correction.

binding force by the dwarf galaxy itself. We suggest that the galactic wind
could have stripped gas in a dwarf galaxy located within the distance of

formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud can also be explained through our

dimensions of the structure projected on the plane of the sky are at least

concentration contains 15 galaxies and one faint (R=21.7) QSO. We consider the
structure in the context of a number of cosmological models and argue that
Lyman-break galaxies must be very biased tracers of mass, with an effective
bias on mass scale M~10^{15}M_{\sun} ranging from b~2 for \Omega_M=0.2 to b >~6
for \Omega_M=1. In a Cold Dark Matter scenario the large bias values suggest
that individual Lyman-break galaxies are associated with dark halos of mass
M~10^{12} M_{\sun}, reinforcing the interpretation of these objects as the
progenitors of massive galaxies at the present epoch. Preliminary results of
spectroscopy in additional fields suggest that such large structures are common
at z~3, with about one similar structure per survey field. The implied space
density is consistent with the possibility that we are observing moderately
rich clusters of galaxies in their early non-linear evolution. Finally, the

will explain why this algebra of pseudodifferential operators is natural.
  For a pseudodifferential operator in this class, $A$, and a classical
elliptic pseudodifferential operator, $P$, we show that the generalized
zeta-function $\Tr(AP^{-s})$ has a meromorphic continuation to the whole
complex plane, however possibly with higher order poles.
  Our algebra of operators has a bigrading given by the order and the highest
log-power occuring in the symbol expansion. We construct ""higher""
noncommutative residue functionals on the subspaces given by the log-grading.
However, in contrast to the classical case we prove that the whole algebra does

theory perspective. While the connection between gravity and particle physics
has not been experimentally probed in the quantum regime, it is severely
constrained by the successes of Standard Model quantum field theory at short
distances, and classical General Relativity at large distances. At first sight,
it appears that combining particle physics and gravity inevitably leads to an
effective field theory below the weak scale which suffers from large radiative
corrections to the cosmological constant. Consequently, this parameter must be
very finely tuned to lie within the experimental bounds. An analog of just this
type of predicament, and its resolution, are described in some detail using
only familiar quantum field theory. The loop-hole abstracted from the analogy
is the possibility of graviton ``compositeness'' at a scale less than $10^{-2}$
eV, which cuts off the large contributions to the cosmological constant from
standard model physics. Experimentally, this would show up as a dramatic
breakdown of Newton's Law in upcoming sub-centimeter tests of gravity.
Currently, strings are the only known example of such compositeness. It is
proposed that the gravitational sector comprises strings of very low tension,
which couple to a stringy ``halo'' surrounding each point-like standard model
particle.

centered around 1700 MeV, are organized into the (3/2,3/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)]
representation. I argue that the members of the (3/2,3/2) multiplet carry
unnatural parities and that in this region chiral symmetry is restored. In the
N(939)- N(1650) transition the chiral symmetry mode is changed, and therefore,
a chiral phase transition is predicted to take place.

roll regime to the SDC regime and, on the other branch, decreasing it in the
opposite manner. We find that the data of several time-averaged global
quantities all form hysteretic loops from the two branches. We also discuss
several possible scenarios for the transition and analyze our data for SDC
accordingly. We conclude that the roll-to-SDC transition is first-order in
character and that the correlation length diverges at the conduction to
convection onset. We further postulate that this transition can be understood
somewhat similar to the hexagon-to-roll transition in non-Boussinesq fluids.

repeated measurements on the quantum dynamics of the multilevel systems that
exhibit the quantum localization of the classical chaos. The analysis is based
on the wave function and Schroedinger equation, without introduction of the
density matrix. We show how the quantum Zeno effect in simple few-level systems
can be recovered and understood by formal modeling the measurement effect on
the dynamics by randomizing the phases of the measured states. Further the
similar analysis is extended to investigate of the dynamics of multilevel
systems driven by an intense external force and affected by frequent
measurement. We show that frequent measurements of such quantum systems results
in the delocalization of the quantum suppression of the classical chaos. This
result is the opposite of the quantum Zeno effect. The phenomenon of
delocalization of the quantum suppression and restoration of the classical-like
time evolution of these quasiclassical systems, owing to repetitive frequent
measurements, can therefore be called the 'quantum anti-Zeno effect'. From this
analysis we furthermore conclude that frequently or continuously observable
