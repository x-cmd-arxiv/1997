of mass fluctuations, P(k), from observations of the high redshift \lya forest.
The method is motivated by the physical picture of the \lya forest that has
emerged from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations and related semi-analytic
models, which predicts a tight correlation between the \lya optical depth and
the underlying matter density. We monotonically map the QSO spectrum to a
Gaussian density field, measure its 3-d P(k), and normalize by evolving
cosmological simulations with this P(k) until they reproduce the observed power
spectrum of the QSO flux. Imposing the observed mean \lya opacity as a
constraint makes the derived P(k) normalization insensitive to the choice of
cosmological parameters, ionizing background spectrum, or reionization history.
Thus, in contrast to estimates of P(k) from galaxy clustering, there are no
uncertain ""bias parameters"" in the recovery of the mass power spectrum. We test
the full procedure on SPH simulations of 3 cosmological models and show that it
recovers their true mass power spectra on comoving scales ~1-10/h Mpc, the
upper scale being set by the size of the simulation boxes. The procedure works
even for noisy (S/N ~ 10), moderate resolution (~40 km/s pixels) spectra. We
present an illustrative application to Q1422+231; the recovered P(k) is
consistent with an \Omega=1, \sigma_8=0.5 CDM model. Application to large QSO
samples should yield the power spectrum of mass fluctuations on small scales at
z ~ 2-4. (Compressed)

collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE), focusing on the coarse-grained approach
towards equilibrium. The CBE is a noncanonical Hamiltonian system with the
distribution function f the fundamental dynamical variable, the mean field
energy H[f] playing the role of the Hamiltonian and the natural arena of
physics being the infinite-dimensional phase space of distribution functions.
Every time-independent equilibrium f_0 is an energy extremal with respect to
all perturbations that preserve the constraints associated with Liouville's
Theorem, local energy minima corresponding to linearly stable equilibria. If an
initial f(t=0) is sufficiently close to some linearly stable lower energy f_0,
its evolution involves linear phase space oscillations about f_0 which, in many
cases, would be expected to exhibit linear Landau damping. If f(t=0) is far
from any stable extremal, the flow will be more complicated but, in general,
one would anticipate that the evolution involves nonlinear oscillations about
some lower energy f_0. In this picture, the coarse-grained approach towards
equilibrium usually termed violent relaxation is interpreted as nonlinear
Landau damping. The evolution of a generic initial f(t=0) involves a coherent
initial excitation, not necessarily small, being converted into incoherent
motion associated with nonlinear oscillations about some equilibrium f_0 which,
in general, will exhibit destructive interference.

processes, where the interaction rate is an increasing function of the capital
difference of the two traders. The wealth distribution in multiplicative

matter via the correlation of identical particles. We find that a modification
of hadronic masses in medium leads to two-mode squeezing which signals itself
in a back-to-back correlations of hadrons. This effect leads to a signal of a
shift of $\phi$-meson mass.

can be coupled through the action of suitably-chosen laser excitation. We
concentrate on a two-dimensional ion trap with dissimilar vibrational
frequencies in the x- and y-directions of motion, and derive from first
principles a variety of quantized two-mode couplings, concentrating on a linear
coupling which takes excitations from one mode to another. We demonstrate how
this can result in a state rotation, in which it is possible to transfer the
motional state of the ion from say the x-direction to the y-direction without
prior knowledge of that motional state.
