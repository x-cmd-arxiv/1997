regions of galaxies, and dominate the integrated emission from the galaxy. They
are a significant component of the present- day universe, being the site of
$\sim$ 25% of the high-mass star- formation. They offer unique `laboratories'
for testing our ideas about star-formation, the evolution of high-mass stars,
and the physics of the interstellar medium. They serve as local analogs of the
processes that were important in the origin and early evolution of galaxies and
in the heating and chemical enrichment of the inter-galactic medium. In this
contribution I review starbursts from this broad cosmogonical perspective,
stressing several key lessons we have learned from starbursts: 1) Violent,
transient events play a significant role in the origin and evolution of
galaxies. 2) Galaxies do not evolve as `Island Universes': starbursts are
triggered by galaxy interactions and produce outflows of hot
chemically-enriched gas that `pollute' the inter- galactic medium. 3) Dust
dramatically affects of view of high-mass star-formation in starbursts and
(probably) in high-redshift galaxies. Throughout this review I emphasize the
importance of space-based observations in understanding starbursts.

of the modified Eddington limit qualitatively corresponds to the
Humphreys-Davidson (HD) limit defined by the most luminous supergiants, the
modified limit is actually a full magnitude higher than the upper luminosity
limit observed for LMC stars. The observed limit is consistent with atmosphere
models in which the maximum value of the ratio of the radiation force outwards
to the gravitational force inwards, Y_max, is 0.9, i.e., the photospheres of
stars at the observed luminosity limit are bound. As massive stars evolve, they
move to higher, and therefore less stable values of Y_max, so mass loss, either
sporadic or continuous, may halt their natural redward evolution as they
approach the Y_max = 0.9 limit. We assess the metallicity dependence of this
limit. If the limit does determine the most luminous stars, and the value of
Y_max corresponding to the luminosity limit in the LMC is universal, then the
brightest supergiants the SMC should be only marginally brighter (0.3 mag) than
those of the LMC, in agreement with observations. Moreover, the brightest

accretion may lead to short flares followed by long-term, lower-level emission.
Using a novel accretion disk code which relies primarily on global conservation
laws and the assumption that viscosity is everywhere positive, a broad range of
physically allowed evolutionary sequences of thick disks is investigated. The
main result is that accretion in the thick disk phase can consume only a
fraction of the initial disk material before the disk cools and becomes thin.
This fraction is ~0.5-0.9 for disruptions around 10^6 to 10^7 M_\odot black
holes and is sensitive to the mean angular momentum of the disk. The residual
material will accrete in some form of thin disk over a longer period of time.
The initial thick disk phase may reduce the dimming timescale of the disk by a
factor of ~2 from estimates based on thin disks alone. Assuming an 0.5 M_\odot
initial thick disk, even if the thin disks become advection dominated, the
black hole mass to light ratio can rise above M_\odot/L_\odot = 1 in no less
than 20 (0.1/\alpha) to 2000 (0.1/\alpha) years following a tidal disruption
event, depending on the mass of the black hole and the initial conditions of
the encounter. The long-term emission will be most prevalent around lower mass,
10^6 M_\odot black holes. If the tidal disruption rates in these galactic
nuclei are ~10^{-4} yr^{-1}, then about 10% of the nuclei should exhibit the
long-term UV/optical emission at a level of ~10^{38} ergs~s^{-1}.

features observed within 10 pc of the Galactic Centre-- the circumnuclear disk

inner one parsec can be understood in terms of tidal capture and disruption of
gas clouds on low angular momentum orbits in a potential containing a point
mass. The calculations demonstrate that a dissipative component forms a
``dispersion ring'', an asymmetric elliptical torus precessing counter to the
direction of rotation, and that this shape can be maintained for many orbital
periods. For a range of plausible initial conditions, such a sturcture can
explain the morphology and kinematics of the CND and of the most conspicuous
ionized filament. While forming the dispersion ring, a small cloud with low
specific angular momentum is drawn into a long filament which repeatedly
collides with itself at high velocity. The compression in strong shocks is
likely to lead to star formation even in the near tidal field of the point
mass. This process may have general relevance to accretion onto massive black
holes in normal and active galactic nuclei.

found, which acts as an infrared regulator though not efficiently enough as to
restore the validity of perturbation theory. Indeed, discussing the role of

wavefunctions and uses constituent quark currents with both Pauli and Dirac
components. Significant contributions are found to arise from the Pauli
component when it is interpreted as arising from pion-baryon loops. Including
these pion cloud contributions reduces the strange magnetic form factor
extracted from the recent SAMPLE measurement of the proton's weak neutral
magnetic form factor at low Q^2 by 35 to 52%.

microscopic quark shell model. The initial d' dibaryon wave function (J^P=0^-,
T=0) consists of one 1\hbar\omega six-quark shell-model s^5p[51]_X
configuration. The most important final six-quark configurations s^6[6]_X,
s^4p^2[42]_X and (s^4p^2-s^52s)[6]_X are properly projected onto the NN
channel. The final state NN interaction is investigated by means of two
phase-equivalent - but off-shell different - potential models. We demonstrate
that the decay width \Gamma_d' depends strongly on the short-range behavior of
the NN wave function. In addition, the width \Gamma_d' is very sensitive to the
mass and size of the d' dibaryon.
  For dibaryon masses slightly above the experimentally suggested value
M_d'=2.065 GeV, we obtain a pionic decay width of \Gamma_d' = 0.18 - 0.32 MeV
close to the experimental value \Gamma_d' = 0.5 MeV.

chaotic single particle motion is applied to large amplitude collective motions

weighted wall formula. We conclude that the chaos weighted wall formula
provides a fairly accurate description of one body dissipation in dynamical
systems similar to fissioning nuclei. We also find a qualitative similarity
between the phenomenological friction in nuclear fission and the chaos weighted
wall formula. This provides further evidence for one body nature of the
dissipative force acting in a fissioning nucleus.

shows that the measurement gives a reliable information about the system

paper is concerned with processes defined by a step operator $T$ that is used
to construct a Hamiltonian $H$ according to Feynman's prescription. Differences
between these models and the models of Deutsch are discussed and reviewed. It
is emphasized that the models with $H$ constructed from $T$ include fully
quantum mechanical processes that take computation basis states into linear
superpositions of these states. The requirement that $T$ be distinct path
generating is reviewed. The advantage of this requirement is that
Schr\""{o}dinger evolution under $H$ is one dimensional along distinct finite or
infinite paths of nonoverlapping states in some basis $B_{T}$. It is emphasized
that $B_{T}$ can be arbitrarily complex with extreme entanglements between
states of component systems. The new aspect of quantum Turing machines
introduced here is the emphasis on the structure of graphs obtained when the
states in the $B_{T}$ paths are expanded as linear superpositions of states in
a reference basis such as the computation basis $B_{C}$. Examples are discussed
that illustrate the main points of the paper. For one example the graph
structures of the paths in $B_{T}$ expanded as states in $B_{C}$ include finite
stage binary trees and concatenated finite stage binary trees with or without
terminal infinite binary trees. Other examples are discussed in which the graph
structures correspond to interferometers and iterations of interferometers.
