ApJ Letters, in press",,"10.1086/310907","CITA-97-30","astro-ph",,"  We examine the consequences of radiatively driven warping of accretion disks
surrounding pre-main-sequence stars. These disks are stable against warping if
the luminosity arises from a steady accretion flow, but are unstable at late
times when the intrinsic luminosity of the star overwhelms that provided by the
disk. Warps can be excited for stars with luminosities of around 10 solar
luminosities or greater, with larger and more severe warps in the more luminous
systems. A twisted inner disk may lead to high extinction towards stars often
viewed through their disks. After the disk at all radii becomes optically thin,
the warp decays gradually on the local viscous timescale, which is likely to be
long. We suggest that radiation induced warping may account for the origin of
the warped dust disk seen in Beta Pictoris, if the star is only around 10-20
Myr old, and could lead to non-coplanar planetary systems around higher mass
stars.

gravitational collapse, aimed at testing for ``logatropic'' behavior of the
form $P_t \sim \log \rho$, where $P_t$ is the ``turbulent pressure'' and $\rho$
is the density. To this end, we monitor the evolution of the turbulent velocity
dispersion $\sigma$ as the density increases during the collapse. A logatropic
behavior would require that $\sigma \propto \rho^{-1/2}$, a result which,
however, is not verified in the simulations. Instead, the velocity dispersion
increases with density, implying a polytropic behavior of $P_t$. This behavior
is found both in purely hydrodynamic as well as hydromagnetic runs. For purely
hydrodynamic and rapidly-collapsing magnetic cases, the velocity dispersion
increases roughly as $\sigma \propto \rho^{1/2}$, implying $P_t\sim \rho^2$,
where $P_t$ is the turbulent pressure. For slowly-collapsing magnetic cases the
behavior is close to $\sigma \propto \rho^{1/4}$, which implies $P_t \sim
\rho^{3/2}$. We thus suggest that the logatropic ``equation of state'' may
represent only the statistically most probable state of an ensemble of clouds
in equilibrium between self-gravity and kinetic support, but does not
adequately represent the behavior of the ``turbulent pressure'' within a cloud
undergoing a dynamic compression due to gravitational collapse. Finally, we
discuss the importance of the underlying physical model for the clouds (in
equilibrium vs. dynamic) on the results obtained.

kiloparsec-scale ring-like structure in one of its radio lobes. The radio
observations show a typical core-double morphology: a central core between two
lobes, each of which has a hotspot. The western radio lobe appears as a nearly
continuous ring, with linear polarization electric field vectors which are
oriented in a radial direction from the ring center. We consider several
different interpretations for the nature of this ring, including gravitational
lensing of a normal jet by a foreground galaxy. Even though simple lensing
models can describe the ring morphology reasonably well, the high linear
polarization seen around the ring cannot be easily explained. The chance
interposition of a galactic supernova remnant, nova, planetary nebula, or H II
region, has been ruled out. The highly polarized ring of MG0248+0641 is much
like the prominent ring seen in 3C219, and the multiple ones in 3C310 and
Hercules A, suggesting that similar physical processes are producing shell
structures in these radio galaxies. The ring in MG0248+0641 may be caused by
the formation of ``bubbles'', as a result of instabilities in the energy flow
down the western radio jet. It may also be possible that the required
instabilities are triggered by the infall of gas, via tidal interaction of the
central source with a nearby galaxy. This scenario may be indicated by our
marginal detection of an optical source close to the western hotspot.

projective geometry to provide a unified geometrical framework for statistical
physics. After reviewing the Hilbert space formulation of classical statistical
thermodynamics, we introduce projective geometry as a basis for analysing
probabilistic aspects of statistical physics. In particular, the specification
of a canonical polarity on $RP^{n}$ induces a Riemannian metric on the state
space of statistical mechanics. In the case of the canonical ensemble, we show
that equilibrium thermal states are determined by the Hamiltonian gradient flow
with respect to this metric. This flow is concisely characterised by the fact
that it induces a projective automorphism on the state manifold. The
measurement problem for thermal systems is studied by the introduction of the
concept of a random state. The general methodology is then extended to include
the quantum mechanical dynamics of equilibrium thermal states. In this case the
relevant state space is complex projective space, here regarded as a real
manifold endowed with the natural Fubini-Study metric. A distinguishing feature
of quantum thermal dynamics is the inherent multiplicity of thermal
trajectories in the state space, associated with the nonuniqueness of the
infinite temperature state. We are then led to formulate a geometric
characterisation of the standard KMS-relation often considered in the context
of $C^{*}$-algebras. The example of a quantum spin one-half particle in heat

can be superlight with mass in the micro-eV to keV range. In such a case,
gravitino emission provides a new cooling mechanism for protoneutron stars and
therefore can provide constraints on the mass of the superlight gravitino. This
happens because the coupling to matter of superlight gravitinos is dominated by
its goldstino component, whose coupling to matter is inversely proportional to
the scale of supersymmetry breaking and increases as the gravitino mass
decreases. Present observations therefore provide lower limits on the gravitino
mass. Using recently revised goldstino couplings, we find that the two dominant
processes in supernova cooling are $e^+e^-\to \tilde{G}\tilde{G}$ and
$\gamma+e^-\to e^-\tilde{G}\tilde{G}$. They lead to lower limits on the

modified version of the string-flip potential model was developed, called the
flux-bubble model, which would allow for the addition of perturbative QCD
interactions. In attempts to construct a simple $q\bar q$ nucleon system using

scale, several sectors of matter with different critical speeds in vacuum can
coexist and an absolute rest frame (the vacuum rest frame) may exist without
contradicting the apparent Lorentz invariance felt by ""ordinary"" particles
(particles with critical speed in vacuum equal to $c$, the speed of light).
Sectorial Lorentz invariance, reflected by the fact that all particles of a
given dynamical sector have the same critical speed in vacuum, will then be an
expression of a fundamental sectorial symmetry (e.g. preonic grand unification
or extended supersymmetry) protecting a parameter of the equations of motion.
Furthermore, the sectorial Lorentz symmetry may be only a low-energy limit, in
the same way as the relation $\omega $ (frequency) = $c_s$ (speed of sound) $k$
(wave vector) holds for low-energy phonons in a crystal. In this context,
phenomena such as the absence of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff for protons and
nuclei and the stability of unstable particles (e.g. neutron, several
nuclei...) at very high energy are basic properties of a wide class of
noncausal models where local Lorentz invariance is broken introducing a
fundamental length. Observable phenomena are expected at very short wavelength
scales, even if Lorentz symmetry violation remains invisible to standard
low-energy tests. We present a detailed discussion of the implications of
Lorentz symmetry violation for very high-energy nuclear physics.

Gamma_H necessarily contains qualitatively and quantitatively important terms
proportional to gamma_5 gamma.P and gamma_5 gamma.k k.P, where P is the total
momentum of the bound state. The axial-vector vertex contains a bound state
pole described by Gamma_H, whose residue is the leptonic decay constant for the
bound state. The pseudoscalar vertex also contains such a bound state pole and,
in the chiral limit, the residue of this pole is related to the vacuum quark
condensate. The axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity relates these pole
residues; with the Gell-Mann--Oakes-Renner relation a corollary of this
identity. The dominant ultraviolet asymptotic behaviour of the scalar functions
in the meson Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is fully determined by the behaviour of
the chiral limit quark mass function, and is characteristic of the QCD
renormalisation group. The rainbow-ladder Ansatz for K, with a simple model for
the dressed-quark-quark interaction, is used to illustrate and elucidate these
general results. The model preserves the one-loop renormalisation group
structure of QCD. The numerical studies also provide a means of exploring
procedures for solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation without a three-dimensional

mathematical physics (conformal field theory, integrable systems,
representation theory). The most interesting solution of the QDYB equation is
the elliptic solution, discovered by Felder. In this paper, we prove the first
classification results for solutions of the QDYB equation. These results are
parallel to the classification of solutions of the classical dynamical
Yang-Baxter equation, obtained in our previous paper q-alg/9703040. All
solutions we found can be obtained from Felder's elliptic solution by a
limiting process and gauge transformations. Fifteen years ago the quantum
Yang-Baxter equation gave rise to the theory of quantum groups. Namely, it
turned out that the language of quantum groups (Hopf algebras) is the adequate
algebraic language to talk about solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation.
In this paper we propose a similar language, originating from Felder's ideas,
which we found to be adequate for the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation. This is
the language of dynamical quantum groups (or $\h$-Hopf algebroids), which is
the quantum counterpart of the language of dynamical Poisson groupoids,
introduced in our previous paper q-alg/9703040.
