Isochrone fitting to the colour-magnitude diagrams yields ages in the range
from 9 Myr to 16 Myr without correlation with the distance to the LMC 4 centre.
We construct the luminosity function and the mass function of five regions to
ensure that projection effects don't mask the results. The slopes lie in the
expected range (gamma in [0.22;0.41] and Gamma in [-1.3;-2.4] respectively,
with the Salpeter value of Gamma = -1.35). After our calculations a total of
5-7 10^3 supernovae has dumped the energy of 10^54.5 erg over the past 10 Myr
into LMC 4, in fact enough to tear the original star-forming cloud apart in the
time span between 5 and 8 Myr after the starformation burst, initiated by a
large scale triggering event. We conclude that LMC 4 can have been formed
without a contribution from stochastic self-propagating star formation (SSPSF).

consideration of the fourth channel, and increased attention on the related

weights for the individual measurements needed to define a single duration,
peak flux and fluence. It also shows that, in logarithmic variables, the
hardness ratio $H32$ is significantly correlated with peak flux, while $H43$ is
significantly anticorrelated with peak flux. The principal component analysis
provides a potentially useful tool for estimating the improvement in

The intense UV radiation of massive stars would photoionize the clouds and

confirmed Crab-like remnant in the Cloud. The X-ray emission from N157B can be
decomposed into a bright comet-shaped feature, superimposed on a diffuse
emission region of a dimension $\sim 20$ pc. The flat and nearly featureless
spectrum of the remnant is distinctly different from those of young shell-like
remnants, suggesting a predominantly Crab-like nature of N157B. Characterized
by a power law with an energy slope $\sim 1.5$, the spectrum of N157B above
$\sim 2$ keV is, however, considerably steeper than that of SNR 0540-69.3,
which has a slope of $\sim 1.0$. At lower energies, the spectrum of N157B
presents marginal evidence for emission lines, which if real most likely arise
in hot gas of the diffuse emission region. The hot gas has a characteristic
thermal temperature of 0.4-0.7 keV. No significant periodic signal is detected
from N157B in the period range of $3 \times 10^{-3}-2000$ s. The pulsed
fraction is $\lesssim 9%$ (99% confidence) in the $2-7$ keV range. We discuss
the nature of the individual X-ray components. In particular, we suggest that
the synchrotron radiation of relativistic particles from a fast-moving ($\sim
10^3 km s^{-1}$) pulsar explains the size, morphology, spectrum, and energetics
of the comet-shaped X-ray feature. We infer the age of the remnant as $\sim 5

pay particular attention to a set of theoretical models which well reproduce
the ROSAT 0.5-2 keV band logN-logS, and explore possibilities to further
constrain the models from future observations with ASCA and/or at submm bands.
The latter is closely related to the European PLANCK mission and the Japanese
Large Millimeter and Submillimeter Array (LMSA) project. We exhibit that one
can break the degeneracy in an acceptable parameter region on the $\Omega_0 -
\sigma_8$ plane by combining the ROSAT logN-logS and the submm number counts.
Models which reproduce the ROSAT band logN-logS will have $N(>S) \sim (150-300)
(S/10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1})^{-1.3}$ str$^{-1}$ at $S > 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}

mJy)^{-1.5} str^{-1}$ at $S_\nu > 100 mJy$ in the submm (0.85mm) band. The
amplitude of the logN-logS is very sensitive to the model parameters in the
submm band. We also compute the redshift evolution of the cluster number counts
and compare with that of the X-ray brightest Abell-type clusters. The results,
although still preliminary, point to low density ($\Omega_0\sim 0.3$)

GeV has been completed. The overall phase in pid-->pp has now been determined.
The combined analysis has resulted in an improved fit to the pid elastic and
pid-->pp databases.

single-energy and energy-dependent analyses are described.

momenta for different Malfliet-Tjon type potentials. At a few hundred MeV
projectile energy the total amplitude is quite a smooth function showing only a
strong peak in forward direction. In contrast the corresponding partial wave
contributions, whose number increases with increasing energy, become more and
more oscillatory with increasing energy. The angular and momentum dependence of
the full amplitude is studied and displayed on as well as off the energy shell
as function of positive and negative energies. The behavior of the t-matrix in
the vicinity of bound state poles and resonance poles in the second energy
sheet is studied. It is found that the angular dependence of T exhibits a very
characteristic behavior in the vicinity of those poles, which is given by the
Legendre function corresponding to the quantum number either of the bound state
or the resonance (or virtual) state. This behavior is illustrated with
numerical examples.

A",,"10.1098/rspa.1998.0164",,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum computers use the quantum interference of different computational
paths to enhance correct outcomes and suppress erroneous outcomes of
computations. A common pattern underpinning quantum algorithms can be
identified when quantum computation is viewed as multi-particle interference.
We use this approach to review (and improve) some of the existing quantum
algorithms and to show how they are related to different instances of quantum
phase estimation. We provide an explicit algorithm for generating any
prescribed interference pattern with an arbitrary precision.
