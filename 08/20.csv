L^{-\beta}$, over half the simulated events show a measurable astrometric
shift. Our simulations included 20000 stars in a $256\times 256$ Nyquist

significantly blended $(F_{\ast}/F_{tot}\leq 0.9)$, and of those, 73% had a

that 85% of the events were significantly blended, and that 85% of those had
large shifts. Moreover, the shift is weakly correlated to the degree of
blending, suggesting that it may be possible not only to detect the existence
of a blend, but also to deblend events statistically using shift information.

morphology is not predicted by canonical HB models. Moreover, it cannot be
produced by either a greater cluster age or enhanced mass loss along the
red-giant branch (RGB). The peculiar HB morphology in these clusters may
provide an important clue for understanding the second-parameter effect.
  We have carried out extensive evolutionary calculations and numerical
simulations in order to understand the cause of the sloped HBs in NGC 6388 and
NGC 6441. Three scenarios have been investigated: i) A high cluster helium
abundance scenario, where the HB morphology is determined by long blue loops;
ii) A rotation scenario, where the core mass in the HB models is increased by
internal rotation during the HB phase; iii) A helium-mixing scenario, where
deep mixing on the RGB enhances the envelope helium abundance.
  All three of these scenarios predict sloped HBs with anomalously bright RR
Lyrae variables. We compare this prediction with the properties of the two
known RR Lyrae variables in NGC 6388 as well as with the properties of the
metal-rich field RR Lyrae variables and V9 in 47 Tuc.

the observed shape of the rotation curves is well matched by the density

several previous studies which suggested that the structure of simulated DM
halos is inconsistent with the dynamics of dwarf galaxies. We discuss possible
explanations for this discrepancy. We show that although the mass distribution
in the hierarchically formed halos is on average consistent with the shape of

this mechanism, because ionizing photon flux fades much more quickly than

constraints on the initial mass function (IMF) of the halo. Particular IMFs
have been proposed to cut off both the numbers of low-mass stars contributing
to the infrared background and of high-mass stars which contribute to the
growth of metallicity when they promptly explode as gravitational-collapse
(Type II and Type Ib/c) supernovae. Here we examine the further contribution to
metallicity from the Type Ia (thermonuclear) supernovae which would later be
produced from the halo white dwarf population. We find that, for most of the
evolutionary scenarios for the Type Ia supernova progenitor systems proposed so
far, the constraints on the white dwarf mass fraction in the halo from the
predicted production of iron would be extremely severe. When the predicted iron
excess is not so large, then the exceedingly high Type Ia supernova rate
predicted for the present time would also exclude a major contribution of white
dwarfs to the halo mass. The white dwarf contribution, in all cases, should be
below 5-10%. Besides, for the IMFs considered, the duration of the halo burst
should be shorter than 1 Gyr in order to avoid too large a spread in the iron
abundances of Population II halo dwarfs, and the predicted halo $[O/Fe]$ ratio
would be at odds with observations.

origin related to neutron stars or black holes. Since these compact stellar
remnants form from the most massive stars not long after their birth, gamma-ray
bursts should trace the star formation rate in the Universe; we show that the
GRB flux distribution is consistent with this. Because of the strong evolution
of the star formation rate with redshift, it follows that the dimmest known
bursts have z ~ 6, much above the value usually quoted and beyond the most
distant quasars. This explains the absence of bright galaxies in well-studied
gamma-ray burst error boxes. The increased distances imply a peak luminosity of
8.3e51 erg/s and a rate density of 0.025 per million years per galaxy. These
values are 20 times higher and 150 times lower, respectively, than are implied
by fits with non-evolving GRB rates. This means that GRBs are either caused by
a much rarer phenomenon than mergers of binary neutron stars, or their
gamma-ray emission is often invisible to us due to beaming. Precise burst
locations from optical transients will discriminate between the various models
for GRBs from stellar deaths, because the distance between progenitor birth
place and burst varies greatly among them. The dimmest GRBs are then the most
distant known objects, and may probe the Universe at an age when the first

Finite State Transducers (CFSTs), recognize and combine constituents
efficiently, prohibiting spurious overgeneration. The parsing algorithm
combines a learned partial-parser with a given full-parser such that the role
of the full-parser is limited to combining the constituents, recognized by the
partial-parser, and to recognizing unrecognized portions of the input sentence.
Besides the reduction of the parse-space prior to disambiguation, the present
method provides a way for refining existing disambiguation models that learn

very high nucleation densities and very rapid rates using hot-filament chemical
vapor deposition (HFCVD). The density on mirror-polished silicon was as high as
10^10 - 10^11 cm^{-2}, equivalent to the highest density in a microwave-plasma

orders of magnitude higher than that obtained under conventionally low pressure
(tens of torr, 10^7 - 10^8 cm^{-2}). Also, the density on scratched titanium
substrates was as high as 10^10 cm^{-2}. The samples were characterized using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The mechanism is
investigated in detail, revealing that, under very low pressure, very long mean
free path of the gas species, strong electron emission from the hot filament,
and high efficiency of decomposition of hydrocarbon species by the filament
greatly increase the concentration of reactive hydrocarbon radicals and atomic
hydrogen on the substrate surface, and therefore, dramatically enhance the

stop the running away of the modulus responsible for the value of the gauge

additional dilaton-dependent part in the superpotential. The presence of the
large D-term gives rise to the mixed dilaton/D-term dominated scenarios of susy

as secluded sectors in gauge mediation scenarios are discussed. It is shown
that when the F-I parameter and the gauge coupling are dynamical variables, the

phase represents an equivalent class of gravity theories, which the Einstein
gravity plus a cosmological constant belongs to under a special gauge choice.
The one-loop quantum correction of the theory is calculated by using the
Vilkovisky-DeWitt's method. We find that the scale symmetry is broken
dynamically, and that the Einstein gravity is the ground state of the broken
