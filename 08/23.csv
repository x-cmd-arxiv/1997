Magnetic energy is stored in the twisted flux tubes which are originally formed
in the convection zone and released as flares in the course of the emergence of
the twisted flux tubes above the photosphere.

distributed depending on their magnitude in 4 different sets which we are able
to associate with different molecular mechanisms. The largest compressibilities
(10m/N) are observed in the tilted phases. They are apparently independent of
the chain length and could be related to the reorganization of the headgroup
hydrogen-bounded network, whose role should be revalued. Intermediate
compressibilities are observed in phases with quasi long-range order
(directions normal to the molecular tilt in L_2 or L_2' phases, S phase), and
could be related to the ordering of these phases. The lowest compressibilities
are observed in the solid untilted CS phase and for 1 direction of the S and
L_2'' phases. They are similar to the compressibility of crystalline polymers
and correspond to the interactions between methyl groups in the crystal.
Finally, negative compressibilities are observed in the transverse plane for
L_2' and L_2'' phases and can be traced to subtle reorganizations upon
untilting.

clusters and 2-leg ladders with up to 32 sites are studied with the Lanczos and
Truncated Lanczos algorithms. The main motivation is the recently discussed
spatial distribution of holes in ladders where the maximum probability for the
hole-hole distance is obtained at d=sqrt(2) in units of the lattice spacing, a
counter-intuitive result considering that the overall symmetry of the two-hole
bound state is d_{x^2 - y^2}. The existence of holes in the same sublattice is
argued to be a consequence of non-negligible retardation effects in the t-J
model. The existence of strong spin singlets in the region where the two hole
bound state is located is here confirmed, and a simple explanation for its
origin in the case of planes is proposed. It is predicted that they should
appear regardless of the long distance properties of the spin system under
consideration, as long as the bound state is d_{x^2 - y^2}. In particular, it
is shown that they are present in an Ising spin background. The time
retardation in the family of t-J models leads naturally to low-energy hole
states with nonzero momentum and spin one, providing a possible explanation for
apparent SO(5)-symmetric features observed recently in this context. Finally,
the influence of a short-range Coulombic repulsion is analyzed. The hole
distribution in the d_{x^2 - y^2} bound state is reanalyzed in the presence of
such repulsion. Very short hole-hole distances lose their relevance in the
presence of a realistic hole-hole interaction.

intensive nor an extensive thermodynamic variable and that it vanishes
exponentially in the thermodynamic limit for all one-dimensional finite-range

extensive. However, this remedy results in a quantity that is a trivial
function of the entropy density and hence of no use as a measure of structure
or memory. We conclude by suggesting that a useful ``statistical complexity''
must not only obey the ordered-random boundary conditions of vanishing, it must
also be defined in a setting that gives a clear interpretation to what

lowest order, the primary effect of the nonpolynomial nature of the theories is
a renormalization of the field. The high energy scaling of the 2-->2 cross
section is studied and found to differ significantly from that of pure phi^4
theory. From the 1-loop effective potential we determine that in some cases
radiative corrections destroy classical symmetry breaking, resulting in a phase
boundary between symmetry broken and unbroken theories. No radiatively induced

a (quasi) probability distribution, notwithstanding the fact that p_n can by
itself be regarded as a probability distribution. This leads to classicality
restrictions on p_n that are local in n involving p_n's for only a small number
of consecutive n's, enabling a critical examination of the conjecture that
oscillation in p_n is a signature of nonclassicality.
