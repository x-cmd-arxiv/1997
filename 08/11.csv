  several paragraphs added, references added and updated",,"10.1086/311152",,"astro-ph",,"  The energy source has remained to be the great mystery in understanding of
the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) if the events are placed at cosmological distances
as indicated by a number of recent observations. The currently popular models
include (1)the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole
binary and (2)the hypernova scenario of the collapse of a massive member in a
close binary. Since a neutron star will inevitably collapse into a black hole
if its mass exceeds the limit $M_{max}\approx3M_{\odot}$, releasing a total
binding gravitational energy of $\sim10^{54}$ erg, we explore semi-empirically
the possibility of attributing the energy source of GRB to the accretion-
induced collapse of a neutron star (AICNS) in a massive X-ray binary system
consisting of a neutron star and a type O/B companion. This happens because a
significant mass flow of $\sim10^{-3}$--$10^{-4}M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ may be
transferred onto the neutron star through the Roche-lobe overflow and primarily
during the spiral-in phase when it plunges into the envelope of the companion,
which may eventually lead to the AICNS before the neutron star merges with the
core of the companion. In this scenario, a ``dirty'' fireball with a moderate
amount of beaming is naturally expected because of the nonuniformity of the
stellar matter surrounding the explosion inside the companion, and a small
fraction ($\sim0.1%$) of the energy is sufficient to create the observed GRBs.
In addition, the bulk of the ejecting matter of the companion star with a
relatively slow expansion rate may act as the afterglow. Assuming a
non-evolutionary model for galaxies, we estimate that the birthrate of the
AICNS events is about 2 per day within a volume to redshift $z=1$ for an
$\Omega_0=1$ universe, consistent with the reported GRB rate.

bounds are not particularly interesting, but the lower ones are very tight;

  light front","61 pages, Latex, 8 Pictures,consisting of 36 eps-figures",,,,"hep-th",,"  Modified similarity renormalization (MSR) of Hamiltonians is proposed, that
performes by means of flow equations the similarity transformation of
Hamiltonian in the particle number space. This enables to renormalize in the
energy space the field theoretical Hamiltonian and makes possible to work in a
severe trancated Fock space for the renormalized Hamiltonian.
  Original works of Wegner in solid state physics has served us as the guiding
principle in constructing the MSR scheme.
  The renormalized to the second order effective $QED_{3+1}$ Hamiltonian on the
light front is obtained. This Hamiltonian reproduces in $|e\bar{e}>$ sector the
standard singlet-triplet splitting of positronium and recorves rotational
symmetry of the canonical theory. The lowest and next-to-lowest energy states
of positronium are almost independent on the cutoff when in both cases the
'same' (state and sector independent) counterterms are included.
  The electron (photon) mass counterterms are IR (collinear) finite if all
diagrams to the second order, arising from the flow equations and
normal-ordering Hamiltonian, are taken into account, and vary with UV cutoff in
accordance with $1$-loop renormalization group equations.
  Both approximations of perturbation theory and Fock space trancation are
under the control and can be improved systematically within the proposed
renormalization scheme.

provides a classification of all the intersections in D=10 and D=11 where the
harmonic functions depend on the space transverse to all the individual

  algorithm approach","11 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to Molecular Simulation",,,,"physics.chem-ph",,"  Protein structure prediction can be shown to be an NP-hard problem; the
number of conformations grows exponentially with the number of residues. The
native conformations of proteins occupy a very small subset of these, hence an
exploratory, robust search algorithm, such as a genetic algorithm (GA), is
required. The dynamics of GAs tend to be complicated and problem-specific.
However, their empirical success warrants their further study. In this paper,
guidelines for the design of genetic algorithms for protein structure
prediction are determined. To accomplish this, the performance of the simplest
genetic algorithm is investigated for simple lattice-based protein structure
prediction models (which is extendible to real-space), using energy
minimization. The study has led us to two important conclusions for
`protein-structure-prediction-genetic-algorithms'. Firstly, they require high
resolution building blocks attainable by multi-point crossovers and secondly
they require a local dynamics operator to `fine tune' good conformations.
Furthermore, we introduce a statistical mechanical approach to analyse the
genetic algorithm dynamics and suggest a convergence criterion using a quantity
analogous to the free energy of population.
