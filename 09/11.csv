explains the physics associated with how that material eventually fuses to form

reactions. We explain how the outcome depends on the composition of the
accreting matter, the accretion rate and the mass, radius and thermal state of
the neutron star. We also introduce many new analytic relations that are
convenient for comparisons to both observations and computational results.
After explaining nuclear burning for spherically symmetric accretion onto
neutron stars, we discuss the possibility of asymmetric burning. In particular,
we discuss some of the mysteries from EXOSAT observations of Type I X-Ray
bursts and how the solution to these puzzles may lie in considering the lateral
propagation of nuclear burning fronts around the star. Fully understanding this
problem requires knowledge of parameters previously neglected such as the
distribution of fresh fuel on the star, the magnetic field strength, and the
stellar rotation. Recent RXTE observations of bursters may finally tell us some

supporting a location of the polarizing material within the AGN. The Balmer
line decrement and reddened optical spectrum support the presence of a dusty

  We compared the broad band optical polarization and ionized X-ray absorption
of a collection of Seyfert 1 and 1.5 galaxies, excluding classes of objects
that are likely to have significant neutral X-ray absorption. Warm absorber
objects are generally more likely to have high optical polarization than
objects with no detected ionized absorption. This result lends additional
support to the idea that the warm absorber is associated with dust and implies
either that dust transmission is responsible for at least part of the
polarization or that the polarization is revealed because of the dimming of the
optical spectrum. Spectropolarimetry of Seyfert 1s generally locates the
scattering material inside the narrow-line region and often close to or within
the broad line region, consistent with estimates of the location of the dusty
warm absorber.

absorption lines much broader than the thermal width. We then develop a linear

exhibiting the general high velocity tail, it explains the observed sharp low b
cut-off. The dependence of the b distribution on cosmological parameters, such

their centres which far outshines and outweighs normal ellipticals. The origin
of these brightest cluster galaxies is intimately related to the collapse and
formation of the cluster. Using an N-body simulation of a cluster of galaxies
in a hierarchical cosmological model, we show that galaxy merging naturally
produces a massive, central galaxy with surface brightness and velocity
dispersion profiles similar to observed BCG's. To enhance the resolution of the
simulation, 100 dark halos at $z=2$ are replaced with self-consistent
disk+bulge+halo galaxy models following a Tully-Fisher relation using 100000
particles for the 20 largest galaxies and 10000 particles for the remaining
ones. This technique allows us to analyze the stellar and dark matter
components independently. The central galaxy forms through the merger of
several massive galaxies along a filament early in the cluster's history.
Galactic cannibalism of smaller galaxies through dynamical friction over a
Hubble time only accounts for a small fraction of the accreted mass. The galaxy
is a flattened, triaxial object whose long axis aligns with the primordial
filament and the long axis of the cluster galaxy distribution agreeing with
observed trends for galaxy-cluster alignment.

confining potentials of frequencies $\omega_w$ for the wires and $\omega_s$ for
the stubs. As a function of the ratio $\omega_w/\omega_s$ the conductance shows
nearly periodic minima associated with quasibound states forming in the stubbed
region. Applying a magnetic field B normal to the plane of the device changes
the symmetry of the wavefunctions with respect to the center of the wires and
leads to new quasibound states in the stubs. The presence of the magnetic field
can also lead to a second kind of state, trapped mainly in the wires by the
corners of the confining potentials, that yields conductance minima as well. In
either case, these bound states form for weak B and strong confining
frequencies and thus are not edge states. Finally, we show experimental
evidence for the presence of these quasi-bound states.

threshold perturbations separate undercritical perturbations which return to
the normal phase from overcritical perturbations which lead to the
superconducting phase. Careful numerical work in the small-current limit shows
that the amplitude of these solutions is exponentially small in the current; we
provide an approximate analysis which captures this behavior. As the current is
increased toward the stall current J*, the width of these solutions diverges
resulting in widely separated normal-superconducting interfaces. We map out
numerically the dependence of J* on u (a parameter characterizing the material)
and use asymptotic analysis to derive the behaviors for large u (J* ~ u^-1/4)
and small u (J -> J_c, the critical deparing current), which agree with the
numerical work in these regimes. For currents other than J* the interface
moves, and in this case we study the interface velocity as a function of u and
J. We find that the velocities are bounded both as J -> 0 and as J -> J_c,
contrary to previous claims.

Despite the fact that this problem has been recognized as important for forty

considering a broken symmetry state that consists of one vortex in an infinite

the disappearance of the liquid phase observed for simple atomic systems as the

verify Bohr's complementarity principle for fermions. We utilize a double path
interferometer with two slits, with one slit being replaced by a coherent
quantum dot (QD). A short one dimensional channel, in the form of a quantum
point contact (QPC), in close proximity to the QD, serves as a which path
detector. We find that by varying the properties of the QPC detector we affect
the visibility of the interference, inducing thus dephasing. We develop a
simple model to explain the dephasing due to the nearby detector and find good
agreement with the experiment.

system of two-level atoms placed within a frequency gap medium (FGM). Apart
from ordinary solitons and single particle impurity band states, the
many-particle spectrum of the system contains massive pairs of confined gap
excitations and their bound complexes - gap solitons. In addition,
``composite'' solitons are predicted as bound states of ordinary and gap
solitons. Quantum gap and composite solitons propagate without dissipation, and
should be associated with self-induced transparency pulses in a FGM.

recently introduced approach to subdynamics of a macrosystem. The equation
describing the interaction is of the Lindblad type and using the Fermi
pseudopotential we show that the commutator term is an optical potential
leading to well-known relations in neutron optics. The other terms, usually
ignored in optical descriptions and linked to the dynamic structure function of
the medium, give an incoherent contribution to the dynamics, which keeps
diffuse scattering and attenuation of the coherent beam into account, thus
warranting fulfilment of the optical theorem. The relevance of this analysis to
experiments in neutron interferometry is briefly discussed.

leads to a variety of 1+1 soliton equations. By varying the rank of the
underlying $sl (n)$ algebra as well as its gradation in the affine setting, one
encompasses the set of the soliton equations of the constrained KP hierarchy.
The soliton solutions are then obtained as elements of the orbits of the
dressing transformations constructed in terms of representations of the vertex
operators of the affine $sl (n)$ algebras realized in the unconventional
gradations. Such soliton solutions exhibit non-trivial dependence on the KdV
(odd) time flows and KP (odd and even) time flows which distinguishes them from
the conventional structure of the Darboux-B\""{a}cklund Wronskian solutions of
the constrained KP hierarchy.
