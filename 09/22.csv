median redshift of radio sources in existing catalogues is z=1, which allows us
to study large scale structure on scales between those accessible to present
optical and infrared surveys, and that of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB). The dipole is due to 2 effects which turn out to be of comparable
magnitude: (i) our motion with respect to the CMB, and (ii) large scale
structure, parameterised here by a family of Cold Dark Matter power-spectra. We
make specific predictions for the Green Bank (87GB) and Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN)
catalogues. For these relatively sparse catalogues both the motion and large
scale structure dipole effects are expected to be smaller than the Poisson
shot-noise. However, we detect dipole and higher harmonics in the combined
87GB-PMN catalogue which are far larger than expected. We attribute this to a 2
% flux mismatch between the two catalogues. We also investigate the existence
and extent of the Supergalactic Plane in the above catalogues. In a strip of +-
10 deg of the standard Supergalactic equator, we find a 3-sigma detection in

scenario the most plausible candidates are brown dwarfs, M-dwarfs or white
dwarfs and cold molecular clouds (mainly of $H_2$). The former can be detected
with the ongoing microlensing experiments, which are rapidly leading to
important new results. The French collaboration EROS and the
American-Australian collaboration MACHO have reported until August 1997 the
observation of $\sim$ 16 microlensing events by monitoring during several years
the brightness of millions of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and one event
towards the Small Magellanic Cloud. In particular, the MACHO team found 8
microlensing candidates by analysing their first 2 years of observations. This
implies that the halo dark matter fraction in form of MACHOs (Massive
Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) is of the order of 45-50% assuming a
standard spherical halo model. More than 150 microlensing events have been

quantum antiferromagnet. We applied a spin-density-wave formalism extended to a
large number of orbitals and obtained an integral equation for the full
quasiparticle Green's function in the self-consistent ""non-crossing"" Born
approximation. We found that for $t/J \gg 1$, the bare fermionic dispersion is
completely overshadowed by the self-energy corrections. We obtain a broad
incoherent continuum which extends over a frequency range of $\sim 6t$ and a
narrow region of width $O(JS)$ below the top of the valence band, where the
excitations are mostly coherent, though with a small quasiparticle residue $Z
\sim J/t$. Furthermore, we argue in this paper that two-magnon Raman scattering
as well as neutron scattering experiments strongly suggest that the zone
boundary magnons are not free particles since a substantial portion of their
spectral weight is transferred into an incoherent background. We modeled this
effect by introducing a cutoff $q_c$ in the integration over magnon momenta. We
found analytically that for small $q_c$, the strong coupling solution for the
Green's function is universal, and both effective masses are equal to
$(4JS)^{-1}$. We further computed the full fermionic dispersion for $J/t =0.4$
relevant for $Sr_2CuO_2Cl_2$, and $t^\prime=-0.4J$ and found not only that the
masses are both equal to $(2J)^{-1}$, but also that the energies at $(0,0)$ and
$(0,\pi)$ are equal, the energy at $(0,\pi/2)$ is about half of that at
$(0,0)$, and the bandwidth for the coherent excitations is around $3J$. All of
these results are in full agreement with the experimental data.

by representations and vertices labeled by intertwining operators, a spin foam
is a 2-dimensional complex with faces labeled by representations and edges
labeled by intertwining operators. Spin foams arise naturally as
higher-dimensional analogs of Feynman diagrams in quantum gravity and other
gauge theories in the continuum, as well as in lattice gauge theory. When
formulated as a `spin foam model', such a theory consists of a rule for
computing amplitudes from spin foam vertices, faces, and edges. The product of
these amplitudes gives the amplitude for the spin foam, and the transition
amplitude between spin networks is given as a sum over spin foams. After
reviewing how spin networks describe `quantum 3-geometries', we describe how
spin foams describe `quantum 4-geometries'. We conclude by presenting a spin
foam model of 4-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, closely related to the

events in deep inelastic positron-proton scattering at HERA in which the proton
in the final state is detected and its momentum measured. The events are
selected by requiring a scattered proton in the ZEUS leading proton
spectrometer (LPS) with $\xl>0.97$, where $\xl$ is the fraction of the incoming
proton beam momentum carried by the scattered proton. The use of the LPS
significantly reduces the contamination from events with diffractive
dissociation of the proton into low mass states and allows a direct measurement
of $t$, the square of the four-momentum exchanged at the proton vertex. The
dependence of the cross section on $t$ is measured in the interval
$0.073<|t|<0.4$~$\gevtwo$ and is found to be described by an exponential shape
with the slope parameter $b=\tslopeerr$. The diffractive structure function
$\ftwodfour$ is presented as a function of $\xpom \simeq 1-\xl$ and $\beta$,
the momentum fraction of the struck quark with respect to $\xpom$, and averaged
over the $t$ interval $0.073<|t|<\ftwodfourtmax$~$\gevtwo$ and the photon
virtuality range $5<Q^2<20~\gevtwo$. In the kinematic range $4 \times 10^{-4} <
\xpom < 0.03$ and $0.015<\beta<0.5$, the $\xpom$ dependence of $\ftwodfour$ is
fitted with a form $\xpoma$, yielding $a= \ftwodfouraerr$. Upon integration
over $t$, the structure function $\ftwod$ is determined in a kinematic range
extending to higher $\xpom$ and lower $\beta$ compared to our previous
analysis; the results are discussed within the framework of Regge theory.
