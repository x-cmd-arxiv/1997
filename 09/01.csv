spectral lines most widely used as optical and near-infrared indicators of
chromospheric activity such as H_beta, Mg I b triplet, Na I D_1, D_2, He I D_3,
H_alpha, and Ca II IRT lines, as well as a large number of photospheric lines
which can also be affected by chromospheric activity. The spectra have been
compiled with the aim of providing a set of standards observed at
high-resolution to be used in the application of the spectral subtraction
technique to obtain the active-chromosphere contribution to these lines in
chromospherically active single and binary stars. This library can also be used
for spectral classification purposes. A digital version with all the spectra is
available via ftp and the World Wide Web (WWW) in both ASCII and FITS formats.

  accompanying this article","Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 7, (1997), 83-124",,,"cs.AI",,"  Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex,
dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as
education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective
robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains
obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter
differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment.
Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities
or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and
communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting
individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their
inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their
domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key
to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of
teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination
and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models
enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing
consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork,
called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions
(Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a
(partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel
Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members
monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team
as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM
ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate
sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's
application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical
results.

B431 (1998) 254-262","10.1016/S0370-2693(98)00491-2",,"hep-ph nucl-th",,"  The vacuum spectrum of the $\phi$-meson is characterized by its decay into
$K{\bar K} $. Modifications of the $K {\bar K}$-loops in baryonic matter change
this spectrum. We calculate these in-medium modifications taking both s- and
p-wave kaon-nucleon interactions into account. We use results of the in-medium
$K$ and $\bar K$ spectra determined previously from a coupled channel approach
based on a chiral effective Lagrangian. Altogether we find a very small shift
of the $\phi$ meson mass, by less than 10 MeV at normal nuclear matter density
$\rho_0$. The in-medium decay width of the $\phi$ meson increases such that its
life time at $\rho=\rho_0$ is reduced to less than 5 fm/c. It should therefore
be possible to observe medium effects in reactions such as $\pi^- p \to \phi n$
in heavy nuclei, where the $\phi$ meson can be produced with small momentum.

D57 (1998) 1487-1494","10.1103/PhysRevD.57.1487","Freiburg-THEP 97-19","hep-ph",,"  We derive a nonperturbative result for the Higgs propagator by calculating
the NLO correction in the 1/N expansion of O(N) sigma models. For dealing with
the 1/N expansion beyond leading order, we develop techniques to calculate
certain infinite sets of multiloop Feynman diagrams. We then calculate the
Higgs lineshape in fermion scattering, as seen for instance at a muon collider.
We compare with the existing two-loop perturbative results. There is a
considerable discrepancy between perturbation theory and the 1/N expansion in
LO. By including the NLO correction, this discrepancy is reduced dramatically.
The results are in very good agreement with the two-loop result even for masses
as high as 850 GeV. A maximum of the mass is reached at 930 GeV. For
phenomenological purposes, we give a simple approximate relation between the
Higgs mass and width.

product of two such representations, a new basis is constructed on which the
generators of U have a simple action. Using this basis, a general formula is
obtained for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of U. It is shown that the
