open questions: 1. where does the high energy cosmic rays below the knee

origin or contineuosly during their residence in the Galaxy. We show that
$10^15$ eV light nuclei are probably accelerted by associations of supernovae.
The ratio of the spectra of secondary to primary cosmic rays would be affected
by repeated acceleration (also called reacceleration or secondary acceleration)
in the ISM during their propagation in the galaxy. The observed secondary and
primary CR spectra are used to constrain the amount of such reacceleration by
supernova remnants (SNR). Two cases are considered: weak shocks ($1<M<2$) of
old, dispersed remnants, and strong shocks ($M>3$) of relatively young
remnants. It is shown that weak shocks produce more reacceleration than what is
permitted in the framework of the standard leaky box (SLB) model, making it
inconsistent with dispersed acceleration that should be produced by SNR. If the
SLB is modified to allow a moderate amount of RA by week shocks, the RA
produced by old SNRs agrees with the rate required to fit the secondary-to
primaray cosmic-ray data, making a self consistent picture. Significant
reacceleration by strong shocks of young SNRs should lead to flattening of the
secondary-to primaray ratio at high energies, near 1TeV/nucleon.

on the relative I(CO)-N(H_2) for the ring & nucleus. Their individual H_2
masses and surface densities (S(H_2)) exceed typical spiral GMAs regardless of
the conversion factor. Both are associated with a 6 kpc ridge of high S(HI) and
massive star formation (MSF) activity. H-alpha imaging shows a patchy ring of
HII regions situated along the HI ring's outer edge. The latter's kinematics
show clear signs of expansion. A simple rotating-expanding ring model (V_exp =
118+-30 km/s) fits the data well, implying a ring age of >~60+-15 Myr. NGC
2445's ring is able to promptly form very large molecular complexes in a metal
poor ISM and trigger MSF. Nearly 80% of the detected 12CO(1-0) flux originates
in a resolved central source that is slightly offset from NGC 2445's starburst
nucleus. We find an ordered velocity field in this component. Assuming an
inclined disk, we argue that it is dynamically stable. The central S(H_2)
significantly exceeds values typically found in normal spirals, but is much
smaller than S(H_2) derived in similar sized regions of IR luminous galaxies.
The nuclear H_2 may be the result of a previous encounter with NGC 2444.
12CO(1-0) emission in ring galaxies may be dominated by the nucleus, which
could bias the interpretation of single-dish measurements.

indicating a common origin and a major outburst and mass-loss event 6630 yr
ago. The ionized mass within the hourglass is between 0.3 Mo and 0.6 Mo - quite
comparable to the total mass suggested for the expanding (pre-supernova) shell
around SN 1987 A. The hourglass structure around Sher 25 is similar to that of
SN 1987 A in spatial extent, mass, and velocities. The major differences
between these two nebulae might arise from environmental effects. Both internal

Furthermore, Sher 25 and its hourglass-shaped nebula appear to be moving to the
south-west with respect to the ambient interstellar medium, and ram pressure
has apparently deformed the hourglass. We conclude that the circumstellar
nebulae around SN 1987 A and Sher 25 are very similar and define a new class of

coupling constants with dibaryons following from the requirement of stability
of dibaryon matter against compression are derived and the effect of sigma -
and pi - meson exchange current contributions to the sigma - dibaryon coupling
constant is discussed. The mean-field solutions of the model are constructed.
The effective nucleon mass vanishes when the density of dibaryons approaches a
critical value about 0.15/fm^3. The Green's functions of the equilibrium binary
mixture of nucleons and dibaryons are constructed by solving the Gorkov-Dyson
system of equations in the no-loop approximation. We find that when the square
of the sound velocity is positive, the dispersion laws for all elementary
excitations of the system are real functions. This indicates stability of the
ground state of the heterophase nucleon-dibaryon mixture. In the model
considered, production of dibaryons becomes energetically favorable at higher
