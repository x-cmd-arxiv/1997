presented. The underlying dynamic models are delayed detonation explosions in
Chandrasekhar mass carbon/oxygen white dwarfs. In combination with the
radiative transport codes employed here, these models provide plausible fits to
the optical spectra of ""normal"" Type Ia supernova. Two independent radiative
transport codes are used, one that assumes LTE and one that computes non-LTE
excitations and ionization. The models are compared with infrared data
available in the literature. The independent codes give a reasonable
representation of the data and provide physical explanations for their origin
independent of the detailed assumptions of the radiative transfer. The infrared
gives an especially powerful diagnostic of the dynamic model because with
strongly variable line blanketing opacity it probes different depths within the
exploded white dwarf at the same epoch. The velocity of the transition zone
between explosive oxygen and carbon burning can be directly determined. The
velocity at which the burning to nickel stops can also be probed. These
velocities are very sensitive to the explosion physics.

Plane (FP) for rich clusters of galaxies. The 20 clusters with the most regular
projected galaxy distributions appear to define a quite narrow FP, which is
similar to the FP found by Schaeffer et al., who used other clusters. Our
cluster FP appears to be different from that of ellipticals, as well as from
the virial prediction. The latter fact may have several physical explanations,
or a combination thereof. If M/L varies with L this will change the FP slope
away from the virial slope. Differences in dynamical structure between clusters
will also produce deviations from the virial FP. In view of the long
virialization time-scales in all but the very central parts of galaxy clusters,
the deviation of the cluster FP from the virial expectation may also result
from clusters not being totally virialized. The scatter of the observations
around the cluster FP is fairly small. An important part of the observed
scatter is likely to be intrinsic. If this intrinsic spread were due
exclusively to deviations from the Hubble flow it would imply cluster peculiar
velocities of at most about 1000 km.s-1.

windowing the power spectrum with the simulation volume before discretizing,

scale, sigma8. The method utilizes the rate of evolution of the abundance of

that the cluster abundance evolution is a strong function of sigma8: d log n/dz
~ -1/sigma8^2; low sigma8 models evolve exponentially faster than high sigma8
models, for a given mass cluster. For example, the number density of Coma-like
clusters decreases by a factor of ~10^3$ from z = 0 to z ~ 0.5 for sigma8=0.5
models, while the decrease is only a factor of ~5 for sigma8 ~ 1. The strong
exponential dependence on sigma8 arises because clusters represent rarer
density peaks in low sigma8 models. We show that the evolution rate at z < 1 is
insensitive to the density parameter $\Omega$ or to the exact shape of the
power spectrum. Cluster evolution therefore provides a powerful constraint on
sigma8. Using available cluster data to z ~ 0.8, we find sigma8 = 0.83 +/-
0.15. This amplitude implies a bias parameter b ~ 1/sigma8 = 1.2 +/- 0.2, i.e.,

was controversially reported to be a source of CO emission, indicative of rapid
star-formation (Frayer, Brown & Vanden Bout 1994; Braine, Downes & Guilloteau
1996). There is no sign of [C II] emission in our spectrum, which was obtained
during excellent observing conditions at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope
(JCMT) and covers 1890 km/s. The upper limit we have placed on the integrated
line intensity (3 sigma(T_MB) < 5.9 K km/s for a profile akin to that of the CO
lines) constrains the [C II]/CO(1-0) line-intensity ratio to 3 sigma < 8300,
based on the line intensity reported by Frayer et al. (1994), or to 3 sigma <
58700 based on the data obtained by Braine et al. (1996). These limits are
consistent with values measured in the Galactic plane and for nearby starburst
nuclei; the former, however, is significantly lower than the ratio found in
low-metallicity systems such as the Large Magellanic Cloud (which might be
expected to have much in common with a damped Ly-alpha absorption system at
high redshift). This can be taken as evidence against the reality of the CO
line detections, with the proviso that a system significantly larger than
present-day disk galaxies would NOT have been fully covered by our small beam
whereas it WOULD have been properly sampled by the Frayer et al. observations.
Finally, we demonstate (as did Ivison et al. 1996) that knitting together
overlapping bands can generate erroneous results - specifically, an emission
feature that has a width, profile and central velocity consistent with the
controversial CO emission lines and which could have drawn us to entirely the
wrong conclusions.

profiles. In particular, we consider V- and T-shaped structures for which
significant experimental advances were obtained recently. Above band gap, a
very general result obtained by this approach is that electron-hole Coulomb
correlation removes the inverse-square-root single-particle singularity in the
optical spectra at band edge, in agreement with previous reports from purely
one-dimensional models. Strong correlation effects on transitions in the
continuum are found to persist also at high densities of photoexcited carriers.

ratio holds for quite different wire cross sections and compositions. As a
consequence, we identify a shape- and barrier-independent parameter that
governs a universal scaling law for exciton binding energy with size. Previous
indications that the shape of the wire cross-section may have important effects

to be described on a time scale of the order of (at least) tenths of a second
and on a length scale of nanometers. An adequate theory of growth should
describe the atomistic level on very short time scales (femtoseconds), the
formation of small islands (microseconds), as well as the evolution of
mesoscopic and macroscopic structures (tenths of seconds).
  The development of efficient algorithms combined with the availability of
cheaper and faster computers has turned density functional theory (DFT) into a
reliable and feasible tool to study the microscopic aspects of growth phenomena
(and many other complex processes in materials science, condensed matter
physics, and chemistry). In this paper some DFT results for diffusion
properties on metallic surfaces are presented. Particularly, we will discuss
the current understanding of the influences of strain on the diffusion (energy
barrier and prefactor) of a single adatom on a substrate.
  A DFT total energy calculation by its nature is primarily a static
calculation. An accurate way to describe the spatial and temporal development
of a growing crystal is given by kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We will describe
the method and its combination with microscopic parameters obtained from ab
initio calculations. It is shown that realistic ab initio kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations are able to predict an evolving mesoscopic structure on the basis

proposed, in which continuous classical fields are replaced by discrete
quantized variables which undergo dimensional reduction. The 2-d classical O(3)
model emerges from the (2+1)-d quantum Heisenberg model formulated in terms of
quantum spins. Dimensional reduction is demonstrated explicitly by simulating
correlation lengths up to 350,000 lattice spacings using a loop cluster
algorithm. In the framework of D-theory, gauge theories are formulated in terms
of quantum links --- the gauge analogs of quantum spins. Quantum links are
parallel transporter matrices whose elements are non-commuting operators. They
can be expressed as bilinears of anticommuting fermion constituents. In quantum
link models dimensional reduction to four dimensions occurs, due to the
presence of a 5-d Coulomb phase, whose existence is confirmed by detailed
simulations using standard lattice gauge theory. Using Shamir's variant of
Kaplan's fermion proposal, in quantum link QCD quarks appear as edge states of
a 5-d slab. This naturally protects their chiral symmetries without
fine-tuning. The first efficient cluster algorithm for a gauge theory with a
continuous gauge group is formulated for the U(1) quantum link model. Improved
estimators for Wilson loops are constructed, and dimensional reduction to
ordinary lattice QED is verified numerically.

some insights into the structure of the scalar sector of the theory. The
