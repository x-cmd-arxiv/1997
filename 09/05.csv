substructures show considerable overlap. The distance modulus is corrected by
-0.07 mag for the fact that cluster members have lower H I-surface fluxes and
are redder in (B-I) at a given line width than the (field) calibrators.
Different sources of the B magnitudes and line widths have little effect on the
resulting distance. Different precepts for the internal-absorption correction
change the result by no more than +/-0.17 mag. The individual distances of the
cluster members do not show any dependence on recession velocity, inclination,
Hubble type or line width. The dependence on apparent magnitude reflects the
considerable depth effect of the cluster. The adopted distance is in good
agreement with independent distance determinations of the cluster. Combining
the cluster distance with the corrected cluster velocity of 1142+/-61 km/s
gives H_0=55+/-7 km/s/Mpc (external error). If the Virgo cluster distance is

distribution of stars and dust in the LMC, for which the dust scale height is
twice that of the OB stars; that the dust distribution must be non- uniform

is dominated by light gravitinos with mass of $ 100$ eV -- 1 keV, as predicted
by gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking models. After evaluating the
number of degrees of freedom at the gravitinos decoupling ($g_*$), we compute
the transfer function for matter fluctuations and show that gravitinos behave
like warm dark matter (WDM) with free-streaming scale comparable to the galaxy
mass scale. We consider different low-density variants of the WDM model, both
with and without cosmological constant, and compare the predictions on the
abundances of neutral hydrogen within high-redshift damped Ly--$\alpha$ systems
and on the number density of local galaxy clusters with the corresponding
observational constraints. We find that none of the models satisfies both
constraints at the same time, unless a rather small $\Omega_0$ value ($\mincir
0.4$) and a rather large Hubble parameter ($\magcir 0.9$) is assumed.
Furthermore, in a model with warm + hot dark matter, with hot component
provided by massive neutrinos, the strong suppression of fluctuation on scales
of $\sim 1\hm$ precludes the formation of high-redshift objects, when the
low--$z$ cluster abundance is required. We conclude that all different variants

propose a mechanism to explain their nature. In this mechanism a dark galaxy is
formed with a low density disk in a dark halo of high spin parameter; such
galaxies can have surface densities below the critical Toomre value for
instabilities to develop, and following Kennicutt's work we expect these
galaxies to have low star formation rates. The only stellar component of the
galaxies is a halo system, formed during the collapse of the proto-galactic
cloud. We compute synthetic stellar population models and show that, at a
redshift $z=0.5$, such galaxies have apparent magnitudes $B \simeq 28, R \simeq
26$ and $I \simeq 25$, and could be unveiled by deep searches with the Hubble
Space Telescope. Dark galaxies have an initial short blue phase and then become
essentially invisible, therefore they may account for the blue population of
galaxies at high redshift. We find a strong mass-dependence in the fraction of
dark galaxies, and predict that spiral galaxies will not be found in halos with
masses less than about $10^9 M_\odot$, if $\Omega=1$. Above about
$10^{12}M_\odot$, all halos can produce luminous disks. The mass-dependence of
the galaxy-formation efficiency introduces the possibility of `spin bias' --
luminous galaxies being associated preferentially with strongly-clustered
high-mass halos. A further prediction is that the slope of the faint-end
luminosity function for galaxies will be flatter than the associated halo mass
function.

$\Sigma(k,\omega)$, satisfies the Kramers - Kronig relationship automatically.
Due to our choice of the self - energy, the system is not a Fermi liquid for
any value of the interaction, a result which is also true in the moment
approach of Nolting without lifetime effects. By increasing the value of the
local interaction, $U/W$, at half-filling ($\rho = 1/2$), we go from a
paramagnetic metal to a paramagnetic insulator, (Mott metal - insulator
transition ($MMIT$)) for values of $U/W$ of the order of $U/W \geq 1$ ($W$ is

the main weakness of the spherical approximation of Nolting: a finite gap for
any finite value of the interaction, i.e., an insulator for any finite value of

found to divide into two distinct classes. The largest cluster permeates the
lattice, has a density that scales and produces the string tension. The
remaining clusters possess an approximate 1/l^3 number density distribution (l
is the cluster length), their radii vary as \sqrt l and their total current
density does not scale. Their contribution to the string tension is compatible
with being exactly zero. Their number density can be thought of as arising from
an underlying scale invariant distribution. This suggests that they are not
related to instantons. We also observe that when we locally smoothen the SU(2)
fields by cooling, the string tension due to monopoles becomes much smaller
than the SU(2) string tension. This dramatic loss of Abelian/monopole dominance
occurs even after just one cooling step.

collisions where the temperature only reaches $T_G$, and never rises to $T_c$.
It also means that detection of DCC can not be taken as a signal for an

can simultaneously fit the asymptotic scale parameter Lambda so as to obtain an

factorization theorem, the fragmentation functions only depend on the species
of the produced particles, but not on the process by which they are produced.

formal Green's function integral is solved analytically in two different limits

studied in a quasi-free limit. The results illuminate some of the basic effects

  and some of its Applications, Athens (Greece) 25-28 June 1997; 16 pages,
  LaTex",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  If textbook Lorentz invariance is actually a property of the equations
describing a sector of the excitations of vacuum above some critical distance
scale, several sectors of matter with different critical speeds in vacuum can
coexist and an absolute rest frame (the vacuum rest frame) may exist without
contradicting the apparent Lorentz invariance felt by ""ordinary"" particles
(particles with critical speed in vacuum equal to $c$, the speed of light).
Sectorial Lorentz invariance, reflected by the fact that all particles of a
given dynamical sector have the same critical speed in vacuum, will then be an
expression of a fundamental sectorial symmetry (e.g. preonic grand unification
or extended supersymmetry) protecting a parameter of the equations of motion.
Furthermore, the sectorial Lorentz symmetry may be only a low-energy limit, in
the same way as the relation $\omega $ (frequency) = $c_s$ (speed of sound) $k$
(wave vector) holds for low-energy phonons in a crystal. We show that, in this
context, phenomena such as the absence of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff and
the stability of unstable particles at very high energy are basic properties of
a wide class of noncausal models where local Lorentz invariance is broken
introducing a fundamental length. Then, observable phenomena are produced at
the wavelength scale of the highest-energy cosmic rays or even below this
energy, but Lorentz symmetry violation remains invisible to standard low-energy
tests. We discuss possible theoretical, phenomenological, experimental and
cosmological implications of this new approach to matter and space-time, as
well as prospects for future developments.
