Schoen's Calabi-Yau 3-fold, which is a special complete intersection in a toric
variety. We calculate a part of the prepotential of the A-model Yukawa
couplings of the Calabi-Yau 3-fold directly by means of a theta function and
Dedekind's eta function. This gives infinitely many Gromov-Witten invariants,
and equivalently infinitely many sets of rational curves in the Calabi-Yau
3-fold. Using the toric mirror construction, we also calculate the prepotential
of the B-model Yukawa couplings of the mirror partner. Comparing the expansion
of the B-model prepotential with that of the A-model prepotential, we check a
part of the Mirror Symmetry Conjecture up to a high order.

presented, tracing the injection processes and the influence of optical
thickness of the radio halo for very low frequency emission due to synchrotron
self absorption. Some of the upper limits on the electron spectrum translate
into lower limits of the halo magnetic fields, since the observed synchrotron
radiation is known. Despite uncertainties in the extrapolation of the radio
spectrum to lower frequencies a lower limit to the central field strength of
B_o > 0.3 muG seems to be sure. This is comparable to the value resulting from

to show the highest (1-0)/(2-1) S(1) line ratios. Furthermore, variations in
the line ratio can be attributed to intrinsic fluctuations in the incident

algorithms we have developed for radiative transfer, spectral line opacity, and
NLTE opacity and rate calculations. These algorithms divided the work spatially
or by spectral lines, that is distributing the radial zones, individual
spectral lines, or characteristic rays among different processors and employ,
in addition task parallelism for logically independent functions (such as
atomic and molecular line opacities). For finite, monotonic velocity fields,
the radiative transfer equation is an initial value problem in wavelength, and
hence each wavelength point depends upon the previous one. However, for
sophisticated NLTE models of both static and moving atmospheres needed to
accurately describe, e.g., novae and supernovae, the number of wavelength
points is very large (200,000--300,000) and hence parallelization over
wavelength can lead both to considerable speedup in calculation time and the
ability to make use of the aggregate memory available on massively parallel
supercomputers. Here, we describe an implementation of a pipelined design for
the wavelength parallelization of PHOENIX, where the necessary data from the
processor working on a previous wavelength point is sent to the processor
working on the succeeding wavelength point as soon as it is known. Our
implementation uses a MIMD design based on a relatively small number of
standard MPI library calls and is fully portable between serial and parallel
computers.

Spectrograph (STIS) on-board HST. Its relatively high redshift (0.451) and
luminosity indicate that this is one of the most massive of all known clusters.
The STIS images unambiguously show several arcs in the cluster. The largest two
arcs (> 5 arcsec in length) are symmetrically situated on opposite sides of the
cluster, at a distance of ~ 35 arcsec from the central galaxy. The STIS images
also show approximately 100 faint galaxies within the radius of the arcs whose
combined luminosity is ~ 4 x 10^11 Lsun. We also present ground-based
spectroscopic observations of the northern arc which show one clear emission
line at 6730 A, which is consistent with an identification as [OII] 3727 A,
implying a redshift of 0.81 for this arc. The southern arc shows a faint
continuum but no emission features. The surface mass within the radius of the
arcs (240 kpc), as derived from the gravitational lensing, is 6.3 x 10^14 Msun.

clusters (Hattori et al. 1997). The total surface mass derived from the X-ray
flux within the radius of the arcs is ~2.1 - 6.8 x 10^14 Msun, which implies
that the ratio of the gravitational to the X-ray mass is ~1 to 3. The surface
GAS mass within this radius is ~3.5 x 10^13 Msun, which implies that at least

available to us at Marseille, and the usefulness of on-line analysis, we
concentrate on the performance and accuracy of the direct summation and tree
code software. For the former we discuss the sources of round-off errors. The
standard Barnes-Hut tree code has been modified for GRAPE-3, by dividing
particles into blocks and performing the tree traversal for the whole block.
The forces are then calculated by direct summation over the whole interaction
list. The performance of the tree code depends on the number of particles in
the block, the optimum number depending on the speed of the front end and the
number of boards. The time per step scales with the number of particles, and
decreases only weakly as the tolerance increases. We discuss the effect of the
front end and compare performances with those of general purpose computers.
  The accuracy of both direct summation and the tree code is discussed as
function of the number of particles and the softening. The increased role of
direct summation in the force calculation enhances the accuracy compared to the
standard tree code. Finally, we follow the evolution of an isolated barred
galaxy using different hardware and software in order to assess the reliability
of our results. We find excellent agreement between the pattern speed of the
bar in direct summation simulations run on the high precision GRAPE-4 machines
and on our GRAPE-3 system. The agreement with the tree code is very good for
tolerance values smaller than about 1.0.

(CTB 109) were observed by BeppoSAX in 1996 November. The pulse period of
6.978914 +/- 0.000006 s implies that the source continues its near constant
spin-down trend. The 0.5-10 keV pulse shape is characterized by a double peaked
profile, with the amplitude of the second peak ~50% of that of the main peak.
The pulse profile does not exhibit any strong energy dependence. We confirm the
ASCA discovery of an additional low-energy spectral component from 1E2259+586.
This can best be modeled as a 0.44 keV blackbody, but we cannot exclude that
some, or all, of this emission arises from the part of the SNR that lies within
the pulsar's extraction region.
  The spectrum of G109.1-1.0 is well fit with a non-equilibrium ionization
plasma model with a best-fit temperature of 0.95 keV. The derived mass for the
X-ray emitting plasma (~15-20 solar masses) and its near cosmic abundances
imply that the X-ray emission comes mainly from mildly enriched, swept-up
circumstellar material. The spectrum is strongly out of equilibrium with an
ionization age of only 3000 yr. This age is in good agreement with that derived
from hydrodynamic simulations of the SNR using the above X-ray temperature.

electron column density profile. The refractive properties of the lens are
specified completely by a dimensionless parameter, alpha, which is a function
of the wavelength of observation, the lens' electron column density, the
lens-observer distance, and the transverse diameter of the lens. Relative
motion of the observer and lens produces modulations in the source's light
curve. Plasma lenses are diverging so the light curve displays a minimum, when
the lens is on-axis, surrounded by enhancements above the unlensed flux
density. Lensing can also produce caustics, multiple imaging, and angular
position wander of the background source. If caustics are formed, the
separation of the outer caustics can constrain alpha, while the separation of
the inner caustics can constrain the size of the lens. We apply our analysis to
0954+654, a source for which we can identify caustics in its light curve, and
1741-038, for which polarization observations were obtained during and after
the scattering event. We find general agreement between modelled and observed
light curves at 2.25 GHz, but poor agreement at 8.1 GHz. The discrepancies may
result from a combination of lens substructure or anisotropic shape, a lens
that only grazes the source, or unresolved source substructure. Our analysis
places the following constraints on the lenses: Toward 0954+654 (1741-038) the
lens was 0.38 AU (0.065 AU) in diameter, with a peak column density of 0.24 pc
cm^{-3} (1E-4 pc cm^{-3}) and an electron density of 1E5 cm^{-3} (300 cm^{-3}).
The angular wander caused by the lens was 250 mas (0.4 mas) at 2.25 GHz. For
1741-038, we place an upper limit of 100 mG on the lens' magnetic field.

galaxies, radio galaxies and clusters of galaxies. We need a reasonable model
of the true intergalactic magnetic field. Using recent cosmological simulations
of structure formation in the universe, we estimate the magnetic fields which
correspond to the upper limits in the Rotation Measure to distant radio
sources. We estimate that the magnetic field strength in supergalactic sheets
and filaments may be in the range of 0.1 to 1 muG. If such strengths are
realized inside our Local Supercluster, this opens up the possibility to focus
charged particles in the direction perpendicular to the supergalatic plane,
analoguously but in the opposite direction to solar wind modulation. If
focusing exists, it means that for all particles captured into the sheets, the
dilution with distance d is 1/d instead of 1/d^2. This means in effect, that we
may see sources to much larger distances than expected sofar. This effect is
relevant only for energies for which the possible distances are smaller than
the void scale of the cosmological galaxy distribution, in the range possibly
up to 100 Mpc.

us to evaluate the gravitational effects on CMB photons passing through the

allows then to deduce upper limits for the strength of the magnetic field.
These upper limits are of order 0.2 - 2 muG along the filaments and sheets of
the galaxy distribution. In one case, the sheet outside the Coma cluster, there
is a definitive estimate of the strength of the magnetic field consistent with
this range. Such estimates are almost three orders of magnitude higher than
hitherto assumed usually. High energy cosmic ray particles can be either
focussed or strongly scattered in such magnetic filaments and sheets, depending
on the initial transverse momentum. The cosmological background in radio and

surprisingly, that their model is mathematically ill-posed. In an attempt to
correct this difficulty and to construct models that might exhibit realistic
behavior, we have extended the CLN analysis to include dissipative mechanisms
within the cohesive zone. We have succeeded to some extent in finding
mathematically well posed systems; and we even have found a class of models for
which a transition from stability to instability may occur at a nonzero crack
speed via a Hopf bifurcation at a finite wavelength of the applied

We study the role of the monopole for color confinement by investigating the
monopole current system. When the self-energy of the monopole current is small
enough, long and complicated monopole world-lines appear, which is a signal of
monopole condensation. In the dense monopole system, the Wilson loop obeys the
area-law, and the string tension and the monopole density have similar behavior
as the function of the self-energy, which seems that monopole condensation
leads to color confinement. On the long-distance physics, the monopole current
system almost reproduces essential features of confinement properties in
lattice QCD. In the short-distance physics, however, the monopole-current
theory would become nonlocal and complicated due to the monopole size effect.
This monopole size would provide a critical scale of QCD in terms of the dual

term, which generates a projective automorphism of the state space for each
given length scale; and an explicit correction. We then argue that this
structure implies the absence of any symmetry of a geodesic type for the RG
flow when restricted to the parameter space submanifold of the state space.
This is demonstrated explicitly via a study of the one dimensional Ising model
in an external field. In this example we construct exact expressions for the
beta functions associated with the flow induced by infinitesimal rescaling.
These constitute a generating vector field for RG diffeomorphisms on the

exhibits interesting behaviour in its own right. In particular, it now appears
to be quite well established that QED breaks chiral symmetry dynamically as
long as the coupling is sufficiently large. In this contribution we describe
the progress made in applying the polaron variational approach to quenched QED
within the context of the worldline formulation of field theory. Although it is
too early for quantitative results, qualitatively the approach seems promising:
The method is formulated covariantly in Minkowski space-time, the
Ward-Takahashi identities are satisfied, the connection between the bare- and
pole-masses of the electron is gauge independent, the known exact result for
the infrared dependence of the on-shell renormalized propagator is reproduced

model with a one-gluon-exchange potential and an effective meson exchange
potential (EMEP). A deeply-bound state of two H-dibaryons due to the medium
range attraction of the EMEP is obtained. The bound H--H system has a size of
about 0.8 $\sim$ 0.9 fm because of the short-range repulsion generated by the
color-magnetic interaction and the Pauli principle.

nucleons and pions coupled to the dynamical electromagnetic field, the pion
degrees of freedom are eliminated by means of functional integration. Apart
from taking into account some operators perturbatively in $e$, e.g. the vacuum
polarization, this procedure is exact, giving effective theories for nucleons
and photons. The subsequent nonrelativistic reduction yields the corresponding
nonrelativistic quantum field theory. The latter is unique, irrespective of the
precize form of the original nucleon-pion interaction. Nucleonic potentials and
electromagnetic interactions are mutually consistent. Local gauge invariance is
satisfied at any stage of the formal developments.

is shown that the spiral core has a finite mobility and performs Brownian
motion when driven by white noise. Combined with simulation results, this
suggests that defect-free and quasi-frozen states in the noiseless CGLE are
unstable against free vortex excitation at any non-zero noise strength.

and the important role played by the canonical group and the Hamiltonian. We
finally discuss possible implications of our having a selection criterion
generally and of our criterion in particular.
