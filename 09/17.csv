source and is centered on quiescent X-ray emission from the core of M28. The
burst temporal profile is similar to Type-I bursts emitted by accreting neutron
stars of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXB). We argue that the burst arises from an
LMXB that is located in the core of M28. The burst is unique in two ways: it is
intrinsically sub-luminous, ~ 0.02 L_Edd and more importantly, originates from
a source whose quiescent luminosity is fainter than that of the known cluster
bursters by three orders of magnitude. We suggest that this burst is from a
highly magnetized neutron star accreting at a low rate. These accreting systems
may account for the mysterious low luminosity X-ray sources in globular

redshift is shown to be a useful measure of weak lensing by large-scale
structure. Angular correlations in faint galaxies arise due to spatial
clustering of the galaxies as well as gravitational lensing by dark matter
along the line-of-sight. The lensing contribution to the 2-point
auto-correlation function is typically small compared to the gravitational
clustering. However the cross-correlation between two galaxy samples is nearly
unaffected by gravitational clustering provided their redshift distributions do
not overlap. The cross-correlation is then induced by magnification bias due to
lensing by large-scale structure. We compute the expected amplitude of the
cross-correlation for popular theoretical models of structure formation. For
two populations with mean redshifts of $\simeq 0.3$ and 1, we find a
cross-correlation signal of $\simeq 1%$ on arcminute scales and $\simeq 3%$ on
a few arcseconds. The dependence on the cosmological parameters $\Omega$ and
$\Lambda$, on the dark matter power spectrum and on the bias factor of the
foreground galaxy population is explored.

redshift z=1.9342 seen in the spectrum of the quasar Q0151+048A. The redshift
of the absorber is greater than the redshift of the quasar, so the system
resembles the z(abs) ~ z(em) damped absorber at z=2.81 towards the quasar
PKS0528-250. We have previously reported the detection of Ly-alpha emission
from the latter absorber, one of only two damped absorbers for which Ly-alpha
emission has unambiguously been detected. The resemblance between the
PKS0528-250 and Q0151+048A systems is made closer by the detection of a weak
emission feature in the trough of the Q0151+048A absorber. This leads us to
consider whether these z(abs) ~ z(em) DLA absorbers are different objects to
the intervening DLA absorbers. Two possibilities are examined and rejected.
Firstly the Q0151+048A and PKS0528-250 z(abs) ~ z(em) absorbers appear to be
unrelated to the intrinsic absorbers (i.e. gas close to the quasar nucleus,
ejected by the quasar), as intrinsic absorbers are of higher metallicity, have
higher ionisation parameter, and show complex absorption profiles. Secondly
these two DLA absorbers cannot be equated with the gaseous disks of the quasar
host galaxies, as the absorber redshifts differ significantly from the quasar
systemic redshifts. It is likely, then, that intrinsically the z(abs) ~ z(em)
DLA absorbers are the same as the intervening DLA absorbers, so that
peculiarities in some of the z(abs) ~ z(em) absorbers can be ascribed to their
different environment i.e. proximity to the quasar, or membership of the same
cluster as the quasar. We point out that the proximity effect may play some
role, by reducing the Ly-alpha forest line blanketing of any Ly-alpha emission
line from z(abs) ~ z(em) absorbers.

accurate orbits in the given potential by using the impulse approximation and
by introducing adiabatic corrections that allow for the time variation of the

approximation. We also check the results with direct N-body simulations and
find very good agreement. Heating on highly eccentric orbits dominates as the
adiabatic corrections strongly damp the energy change on low eccentricity
orbits. The results are illustrated for the example of globular cluster NGC
6712. For the orbital eccentricities higher than 0.9 the future lifetime of NGC

radio galaxies; their cores are sufficiently X-ray faint that any unbeamed
X-ray emission in the vicinity of the central engine must be obscured. The jets
of such sources are at unfavourable angles for relativistic boosting, and so
their relatively weak X-ray emission must be carefully separated from the
plateau of resolved X-ray emission from a hot interstellar, intragroup, or
intracluster medium on which they are expected to sit. This paper presents
results arguing that jet X-ray emission is generally detected in radio
galaxies, even those of low intrinsic power without hot spots. The levels of

The recently published rotation curves of LSB and dwarf galaxies together with
previously known scaling relations provide sufficient information on the
present day structure of late type disk galaxies to invert the problem. By
requiring that the models reproduce all the observational restrictions we can
fully constrain the initial conditions of galaxy formation, with a minimum of
assumptions, in particular without the need to specify a CDM halo profile. This
allows one to solve for all the initial conditions, in terms of the halo
density profile, the baryon fraction and the total angular momentum. We find
that a unique initial halo shape is sufficient to accurately reproduce the
rotation curves of both LSB and normal late type spiral galaxies. This unique
halo profile differs substantially from that found in standard CDM models
(Navarro, Frenk & White 1996). A galactic baryon fraction of 0.065 is found.
The initial value of the dimensionless angular momentum is seen to be the
principal discriminator between the galaxy classes we examine. The present day

multilevel vorticity fields on the periodic box, and characterize the outcoming
final states. Our final states do not match the predictions of the theories; a
broader variety of dipole profiles, as well as nonstationary final states are
found. The problem of the robustness of the relaxational state with respect to
variations of the Reynolds number and different numerical resolution is
addressed. The observed configurations also do not necessarily possess the
maximal energy, in contrast to what is anticipated by some of the theories. We

dielectrics, we propose a model for their crystallization when no bipolarons
are formed. As the density increases, the melting is examined at $T=OK$. One
possibility is the delocalization towards a liquid state of polarons. However,
we show that this cannot happen if the electron-phonon coupling is larger than
some critical value. The other competing mechanism is the dissociation of the
polarons themselves, favored owing to their large mass at strong coupling.
Finally, we propose a phase diagram for the insulator-to metal transition as a
function of the density and electron-phonon coupling.

approximation to the master-equation, for stochastic self-organized critical
models. In particular, we analyze in detail the properties of sandpile and
forest-fire (FF) models. In analogy with other non-equilibrium critical
phenomena, we identify the order parameter with the density of ``active'' sites
and the control parameters with the driving rates. Depending on the values of
the control parameters, the system is shown to reach a subcritical (absorbing)
or super-critical (active) stationary state. Criticality is analyzed in terms
of the singularities of the zero-field susceptibility. In the limit of
vanishing control parameters, the stationary state displays scaling
characteristic of self-organized criticality (SOC). We show that this limit
corresponds to the breakdown of space-time locality in the dynamical rules of
the models. We define a complete set of critical exponents, describing the
scaling of order parameter, response functions, susceptibility and correlation
length in the subcritical and supercritical states. In the subcritical state,
the response of the system to small perturbations takes place in avalanches. We
analyze their scaling behavior in relation with branching processes. In
sandpile models because of conservation laws, a critical exponents subset
displays mean-field values ($\nu=1/2$ and $\gamma = 1$) in any dimensions. We
treat bulk and boundary dissipation and introduce a new critical exponent
relating dissipation and finite size effects. We present numerical simulations
that confirm our results. In the case of the forest-fire model, our approach
can distinguish between different regimes (SOC-FF and deterministic FF) studied
in the literature and determine the full spectrum of critical exponents.

following two subproblems. The first of them is: which combinations of the
three classical invariants can be realized by a Legendrian knot? (It is
well-known that each invariant by itself can be realized by a Legendrian knot).
The first step in this direction was done by Bennequin who proved that the
Bennequin number of a Legendrian knot is less than twice its genus.
  The second subproblem is whether there exist a pair of Legendrian knots which
have the same classical invariants but are not Legendrian isotopic. Eliashberg
and Fraser showed that this is impossible when knots are trivial as smooth
knots. In the present paper, we develop a theory which allows us, in
particular, to find a counterexample to this subproblem.

distribution of virtual pions in nuclei relative to free nucleons. Analysis of
data from several nuclear experiments has led to claims of evidence against
such a pion excess. These conclusions are usually based on a collective theory
(RPA) of the pions, which may be inadequate. The issue is the energy dependence
of the nuclear response, which differs for theories with strong NN correlations
from the RPA predictions. In the present paper, information about the energy
dependence is extracted from sum rules, which are calculated for such a
correlated, noncollective nuclear theory. The results lead to much reduced
sensitivity of nuclear reactions to the correlations that are responsible for
the pion excess. The primary example is $(\vec p,\vec n)$ spin transfer, for
which the expected effects are found to be smaller than the experimental
uncertainties. The analysis has consequences for Deep Inelastic Scattering
