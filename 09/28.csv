  Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.57.5069",,"cond-mat",,"  We study the dynamics of ordering of a nonconserved Heisenberg magnet. The
dynamics consists of two parts --- an irreversible dissipation into a heat bath
and a reversible precession induced by a torque due to the local molecular
field. For quenches to zero temperature, we provide convincing arguments, both
numerically (Langevin simulation) and analytically (approximate closure scheme
due to Mazenko), that the torque is irrelevant at late times. We subject the
Mazenko closure scheme to systematic numerical tests. Such an analysis, carried
out for the first time on a vector order parameter, shows that the closure
scheme performs respectably well. For quenches to $T_c$, we show, to ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^2)$, that the torque is irrelevant at the Wilson-Fisher fixed
point.

random matrices possessing an eigenvalue gap are studied within the framework
of the orthogonal polynomial technique. Both local and global characteristics
of spectra are directly reconstructed from the recurrence equation for
orthogonal polynomials associated with a given random matrix ensemble. It is
established that an eigenvalue gap does not affect the local eigenvalue
correlations which follow the universal sine and the universal multicritical
laws in the bulk and soft-edge scaling limits, respectively. By contrast,
global smoothed eigenvalue correlations do reflect the presence of a gap, and
are shown to satisfy a new universal law exhibiting a sharp dependence on the
odd/even dimension of random matrices whose spectra are bounded. In the case of
unbounded spectrum, the corresponding universal `density-density' correlator is
conjectured to be generic for chaotic systems with a forbidden gap and broken
time reversal symmetry.

with a full 3D, nonlinear evolution code. These data sets consist of single
black holes distorted by strong gravitational waves, and mimic the late stages
of coalescing black holes. Through comparison with results from well
established axisymmetric codes, we show that these dynamic black holes can be
accurately evolved. In particular, we show that with present computational
resources and techniques, the process of excitation and ringdown of the black
hole can be evolved, and one can now extract accurately the gravitational waves
emitted from the 3D Cartesian metric functions, even though they may be buried
in the metric at levels on the order of $10^{-3}$ and below. Waveforms for both
the $\ell=2$ and the much more difficult $\ell=4$ modes are computed and
compared with axisymmetric calculations. In addition to exploring the physics
of distorted black hole data sets, and showing the extent to which the waves
can be accurately extracted, these results also provide important testbeds for
all fully nonlinear numerical codes designed to evolve black hole spacetimes in
3D, whether they use singularity avoiding slicings, apparent horizon boundary
conditions, or other evolution methods.

reproduction of spin-orbit splittings in finite nuclei after fitting only to
equilibrium properties of infinite nuclear matter. This successful result
occurs when the velocity dependence of the equivalent central potential that
leads to saturation arises primarily because of a reduced nucleon effective
mass. The spin-orbit interaction is then also specified when one works in a
four-component Dirac framework. Here the nature of the spin-orbit force in more
general chiral effective field theories of nuclei is examined, with an emphasis
on the role of the tensor coupling of the isoscalar vector meson (omega) to the
nucleon.
