Ordinary homology is locally trivial. Intersection homology is not. It may have
significant local cycles. A local-global cycle is defined to be a family of
such local cycles that is, at the same time, a global cycle. The motivating
problem is the numerical characterisation of the flag vectors of convex
polytopes. Central is a study of the cycles on a cone and a cylinder, in terms
of those on the base. This leads to the topological definition of local-global
intersection homology, and a formula for the expected Betti numbers of toric

possibility of the formation of PBHs with masses much smaller than one horizon

sub-horizon mass PBHs are expected to form at all epochs. This result suggests
that the constraints on the primordial fluctuation spectrum based on the

magnitude (\Delta (B-R)/\Delta R = -0.056\pm0.002 mag), in the sense that
fainter dEs are bluer and thus presumably more metal-poor. The mean color of
the faintest dEs in our sample is (B-R)~1.15 mag, consistent with a color
measurement of the diffuse intracluster light in the Coma core. This
intracluster light could then have originated from the tidal disruption of
faint dEs in the cluster core. The total galaxy luminosity function (LF) is
well modeled as the sum of a log-normal distribution for the giant galaxies,
and a Schechter function for the dE galaxies with a faint-end slope \alpha =
-1.41\pm0.05. This value of \alpha is consistent with those measured for the
Virgo and Fornax clusters. The spatial distribution of the faint dE galaxies

GHz radio surveys. The cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of both radio surveys
with the unresolved X-ray background were detected at the 5 sigma level. While
the large angular resolution (3 degrees) of the X-ray map makes it difficult to
separate the contributions of clustering from those of Poisson fluctuations,
the amplitude of the CCF provides important constraints on the X-ray emissivity
of the radio sources as well as on the clustering properties of radio and X-ray
sources. These constraints are subject to a number of modeling parameters, e.g.
the X-ray luminosity evolution, clustering evolution, the radio luminosity
function, cosmological model, etc. For reasonable choices of paramters the
X-ray/FIRST CCF is consistent with a correlation scale length of 6/h Mpc. This
is somewhat smaller than the scale length inferred from the autocorrelation
function of the FIRST survey and implies that X-ray sources are less strongly
clustered than strong radio sources, a result which is consistent with previous
constraints on X-ray clustering. The X-ray/GB6-PMN CCF is several times larger
and is likely to be dominated by Poisson fluctuations. This implies that 2
percent of the diffuse X-ray background arises from the GB6-PMN sources.

emission in simple stellar populations (SSP). Adopting analytical relations
describing the evolution of these stars in the HR diagram and empirical
relations for the mass-loss rate and the wind terminal velocity, we were able
to model the effects of the dusty envelope around these stars, with a minimal
number of parameters. We computed isochrones at different age and initial metal
content. We compare our models with existing infrared colors of M giants and
Mira stars and with IRAS PSC data. Contrary to previous models, in the new
isochrones the mass-loss rate, which establishes the duration of the AGB phase,
also determines the spectral properties of the stars. The contribution of these
stars to the integrated light of the population is thus obtained in a
consistent way. We find that the emission in the mid infrared is about one
order of magnitude larger when dust is taken into account in an intermediate
age population, irrespective of the particular mixture adopted. The dependence
of the integrated colors on the metallicity and age is discussed, with
particular emphasis on the problem of age-metallicity degeneracy. We show that,
contrary to the case of optical or near infrared colors, the adoption of a
suitable pass-band in the mid infrared allows a fair separation of the two
effects. We suggest intermediate redshift elliptical galaxies as possible
targets of this method of solving the age-metallicity dilemma. The new SSP
models constitute a first step in a more extended study aimed at modelling the

best-studied blazars, suggests that the highly variable beamed continuum is not
a significant source of photoionization for the gas. Some other source, such as
thermal emission from an accretion disk, must be providing a significant
fraction of the photoionizing flux in these objects. The large amplitude
variability seen at gamma-ray energies must be due to changes in the energetic

inhomogeneities and long-wavelength gravitational waves upon the polarization
properties of electromagnetic radiation as it propagates from cosmologically
distant sources. Scalar (density) fluctuations do not rotate neither the plane
of polarization of the electromagnetic radiation nor the source image. They
produce, however, an appreciable shear, which distorts the image shape, leading
to an apparent rotation of the image orientation relative to its plane of
polarization. In sources with large ellipticity the apparent rotation is rather
small, of the order (in radians) of the dimensionless shear. The effect is
larger at smaller source eccentricity. A shear of 1% can induce apparent
rotations of around 5 degrees in radio sources with the smallest eccentricity
among those with a significant degree of integrated linear polarization. We
discuss the possibility that weak lensing by shear with rms value around or
below 5% may be the cause for the dispersion in the direction of integrated
linear polarization of cosmologically distant radio sources away from the
perpendicular to their major axis, as expected from models for their magnetic
fields. A rms shear larger than 5% would be incompatible with the observed
correlation between polarization properties and source orientation in distant
radio galaxies and quasars. Gravity waves do rotate both the plane of
polarization as well as the source image. Their weak lensing effects, however,
are negligible.

generically chaotic. However, the timescale over which the chaos manifests
itself in the orbital motion is a strong function of the degree of central
concentration of the galaxy. Here, chaotic diffusion rates are presented for
orbits in triaxial models with a range of central density slopes and nuclear
black-hole masses. Typical diffusion times are found to be less than a galaxy
lifetime in triaxial models where the density increases more rapidly than 1/r
at the center, or which contain black holes with masses that exceed roughly
0.1% of the galaxy mass. When the mass of a central black hole exceeds roughly
0.02 times the mass of the galaxy, there is a transition to global
stochasticity and the galaxy evolves to an axisymmetric shape in little more
than a crossing time. This rapid evolution may provide a negative feedback
mechanism that limits the mass of nuclear black holes to a few percent of the
stellar mass of a galaxy.

find that magnetic fields have important effects on the dynamics and structure
of radiative cooling jets, especially at the head. The presence of a helical
field suppresses the formation of the clumpy structure which is found to
develop at the head of purely hydrodynamical jets. On the other hand, a cooling
jet embedded in a longitudinal magnetic field retains clumpy morphology at its
head. This fragmented structure resembles the knotty pattern commonly observed
in HH objects behind the bow shocks of HH jets. This suggests that a strong
(equipartition) helical magnetic field configuration is ruled out at the jet
head. Therefore, if strong magnetic fields are present, they are probably
predominantly longitudinal in those regions. In both magnetic configurations,
we find that the confining pressure of the cocoon is able to excite
short-wavelength MHD K-H pinch modes that drive low-amplitude internal shocks
along the beam. These shocks are not strong however, and it likely that they
could only play a secondary role in the formation of the bright knots observed

fluctuations in the ``inverse compressibility'' (i.e. E_C). Moreover, these
dependences modify the distribution of dV_g fluctuations so that purely upward

scalar Klein-Gordon field on a Robertson-Walker spacetime and prove that it is
a Hadamard state. The state is supposed to approximate a thermal equilibrium
state on a Robertson-Walker spacetime and we call it an adiabatic KMS state.
This opens the possibility to do quantum statistical mechanics on
Robertson-Walker spacetimes in the algebraic framework and the analysis of the
free Bose gas on Robertson-Walker spacetimes. The state reduces to an adiabatic
vacuum state if the temperature is zero and it reduces to the usual KMS state
if the scaling factor in the metric of the Robertson-Walker spacetime is
constant.
  In the second part of our work we discuss the time evolution of adiabatic KMS
states. The time evolution is described in terms of semigroups. We prove the
existence of a propagator on the classical phase space. This defines a time
evolution on the one-particle Hilbert space. We use this time evolution to
analyze the evolution of the two-point function of the KMS state. The inverse
temperature change is proportional to the scale factor in the metric of the
Robertson-Walker spacetime, as one expects for a relativistic Bose gas.

interacting with(non-dissipative) thermo-elastic matter is discussed. It is
based on a gauge condition which allows us to encode the six degrees of freedom
of the ``gravity + matter''-system (two gravitational and four
thermo-mechanical ones), together with their conjugate momenta, in the
Riemannian metric q_{ij} and its conjugate ADM momentum P^{ij}. These variables
are not subject to constraints. We prove that the Hamiltonian of this system is
equal to the total matter entropy. It generates uniquely the dynamics once
expressed as a function of the canonical variables. Any function U obtained in
this way must fulfil a system of three, first order, partial differential
equations of the Hamilton-Jacobi type in the variables (q_{ij},P^{ij}). These
equations are universal and do not depend upon the properties of the material:
its equation of state enters only as a boundary condition. The well posedness
of this problem is proved. Finally, we prove that for vanishing matter density,
the value of U goes to infinity almost everywhere and remains bounded only on
the vacuum constraints. Therefore the constrained, vacuum Hamiltonian (zero on
constraints and infinity elsewhere) can be obtained as the limit of a ``deep
potential well'' corresponding to non-vanishing matter. This unconstrained
description of Hamiltonian General Relativity can be useful in numerical
calculations as well as in the canonical approach to Quantum Gravity.

functions are shown to vanish. This study resolves an apparent obstruction to
the conformal invariance of sigma models obtained via non-Abelian duality based
on non-semi-simple groups.

from one- and two-body currents in this reaction. This is based on the
observation that the $0^+$ ground state and first $2^+$ state of $^{14}$C are
reached predominantly by the removal of a $^1S_0$ pair from $^{16}$O in this
reaction, whereas other states mostly arise by the removal of a $^3P$ pair.
This theoretical prediction has been supported recently by an analysis of the
pair momentum distribution of the experimental data. In this paper we present
results of reaction calculations performed in a direct knock-out framework
where final-state interaction and one- and two-body currents are included. The
two-nucleon overlap integrals are obtained from a calculation of the two-proton
spectral function of $^{16}$O and include both long-range and short-range

experiments at NIKHEF and Mainz.

that the decoherence process is controlled by spectral properties of the
