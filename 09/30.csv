including electron transport in amorphous semiconductors, computer-network

estimated for any FSPP or FRSPP by using a variety of statistical methods.
Simulated FSPPs and FRSPPs consistently exhibit bias in this fractal exponent,
however, rendering the study and analysis of these processes non-trivial. In
this paper, we examine the synthesis and estimation of FRSPPs by carrying out a
systematic series of simulations for several different types of FRSPP over a
range of design values for $\alpha$. The discrepancy between the desired and
achieved values of $\alpha$ is shown to arise from finite data size and from
the character of the point-process generation mechanism. In the context of
point-process simulation, reduction of this discrepancy requires generating
data sets with either a large number of points, or with low jitter in the
generation of the points. In the context of fractal data analysis, the results
presented here suggest caution when interpreting fractal exponents estimated
from experimental data sets.

matter in the galaxy is understanding the distribution of the low density hot
(10^5 K -10^6 K) phase of the interstellar medium (ISM). This phase is much
more difficult to observe than the cooler high density components of the ISM
because of its low density and lack of easily observable tracers. Because gas
of this temperature emits mainly in the far ultraviolet (912 angstrom - 1800
angstroms) and extreme ultraviolet (80 angstrom - 912 angstrom), and (for gas
hotter than 10^6 K) X-rays, observations in these bands can provide important
constraints to the distribution of this gas. Because of interstellar opacity at
EUV wavelengths, only FUV and X-ray observations can provide clues to the
properties of hot gas from distant regions. We present results from a search
for FUV emission from the diffuse ISM conducted with an orbital FUV
spectrometer, DUVE, which was launched in July, 1992. The DUVE spectrometer,
which covers the band from 950 angstrom to 1080 angstrom with 3.2 angstrom
resolution, observed a region of low neutral hydrogen column density near the
south galactic pole for a total effective integration time of 1583 seconds. The
only emission line detected was a geocoronal hydrogen line at 1025 angstrom. We
are able to place upper limits to several expected emission features that
provide constraints on interstellar plasma parameters. We are also able to
place limits on the continuum emission throughout the bandpass. We compare
these limits and other diffuse observations with several models of the
structure of the interstellar medium and discuss the ramifications.

The [OIII] nebula of 4C +19.71 has a size of 74 x 9 kpc, and a luminosity of 3

as that of the two radio lobes. In addition, 4C +19.71 follows the optical
emission line vs. radio power correlation seen in other powerful radio
galaxies. The [OIII] and Lyman alpha emission line luminosities suggest that
the ionized gas mass lies in the range of 2 x 10^8 - 10^9 solar masses. The O/H
ratio in the nebula is at least a few tenths solar, and may be as high as a
factor of three above solar, indicating a previous phase of star formation in

all (massive) Coma Es is older than 8 Gyr, while only S0s, which possess
extended disks, can be as young as 2 Gyr. The old, most massive Es show a
strong light element enhancement, probably due to a rather short star formation
time scale and hence to a SNII -- dominated element enrichment. The lower mass
S0s are much less enhanced in light elements, indicating a longer star

We show that the flux ratio observed from GRS 1915+105 during the prominent

of discrete radio clouds, if one assumes that the twin ejecta are similar, but
not completely identical, i.e. allowing for some asymmetry between the
plasmoids in their speeds of propagation and/or luminosities. The recoil
momentum due to asymmetrical ejection of the pair of plasmoids could be
comparable with the momentum accumulated in the inner accretion disk. We
suggest a possible explanation of the observed anticorrelation between the
X-ray and radio flares as the result of drastic structural changes in the inner
disk caused by production of powerful jets. The delay between the times of
decline of X-rays and appearance of strong radio flares is explained as the
time needed for expansion of radio clouds to become optically thin.

operators and show that it is equivalent to the semiclassical eigenfunction
hypothesis for the Wigner function in the case of ergodic systems. Of great
importance is the rate by which the quantum mechanical expectation values of an
observable tend to their mean value. This is studied numerically for three
Euclidean billiards (stadium, cosine and cardioid billiard) using up to 6000
eigenfunctions. We find that in configuration space the rate of quantum
ergodicity is strongly influenced by localized eigenfunctions like bouncing
ball modes or scarred eigenfunctions. We give a detailed discussion and
explanation of these effects using a simple but powerful model. For the rate of

by expressing the density response of both the condensate and the

selfconsistent Hartree-Fock potentials. Such an approximate account of
correlations (i) preserves an interplay between the condensate and the

vanish in the Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov approximation; and (ii) yields a common
resonant structure for the four partial response functions. The theory reduces
to the temperature-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov-Popov approximation for the
fluctuations of the condensate when its coupling with the density fluctuations

The localization of quasiparticle states arises due to trajectory retracing

the classical limit the states become fully localized, while quantum effects
destroy localization behaviour. We derive the criteria for this localization
and show that it takes place only for sufficiently smooth disorder with large

Localization of quasiparticle states gives rise to resonance peaks in the local

occupation numbers. If done carefully, this improves the accuracy of the
calculated electron densities and total energies and stabilizes the convergence
of the iterative approach towards self-consistency. However, such a boardening
may lead to an error in the calculation of the forces. Accurate forces are
needed for an efficient geometry optimization of polyatomic systems and for ab
initio molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. The relevance of this error and
possible ways to correct it will be discussed in this paper. The first approach
is computationally very simple and in fact exact for small MD time steps. This
is demonstrated for the example of the vibration of a carbon dimer and for the
relaxation of the top layer of the (111)-surfaces of aluminium and platinum.
The second, more general, scheme employs linear-response theory and is applied
to the calculation of the surface relaxation of Al(111). We will show that the
quadratic dependence of the forces on the broadening width enables an efficient
extrapolation to the correct result. Finally the results of these correction
methods will be compared to the forces obtained by using the smearing scheme,

canonical statistical-mechanical free energy $F^C$ in the presence of the
Killing horizons is studied. $F^E$ is determined by the covariant Euclidean
effective action. The definition of $F^C$ is related to the Hamiltonian which
is the generator of the evolution along the Killing time. At arbitrary
temperatures $F^E$ acquires additional ultraviolet divergences because of
conical singularities. The divergences of $F^C$ are different and occur since
the density ${dn \over d\omega}$ of the energy levels of the system blows up
near the horizon in an infrared way. We show that there are regularizations
that make it possible to remove the infrared cutoff in ${dn \over d\omega}$.
After that the divergences of $F^C$ become identical to the divergences of
$F^E$. The latter property turns out to be crucial to reconcile the covariant
Euclidean and the canonical formulations of the theory. The method we use is
new and is based on a relation between ${dn \over d\omega}$ and heat kernels on
hyperbolic-like spaces. Our analysis includes spin 0 and spin 1/2 fields on
arbitrary backgrounds. For these fields the divergences of ${dn \over
d\omega}$, $F^C$ and $F^E$ are presented in the most complete form.

Phys. 107, 9275-9277 (1997)","10.1063/1.475219","LA-UR 97-1591","physics.chem-ph",,"  Free energies of ionic solvation calculated from computer simulations exhibit
a strong system size dependence. We perform a finite-size analysis based on a
dielectric-continuum model with periodic boundary conditions. That analysis
results in an estimate of the Born ion size. Remarkably, the finite-size
correction applies to systems with only eight water molecules hydrating a
sodium ion and results in an estimate of the Born radius of sodium that agrees
with the experimental value.

Groups 3 (1998), no. 4, 321--336",,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  In this paper we show that the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials (and, more
generally, parabolic KL polynomials) for the group $S_n$ coincide with the
coefficients of the canonical basis in $n$th tensor power of the fundamental
representation of the quantum group $U_q sl_k$. We also use known results about
canonical bases for $U_q sl_2$ to get a new proof of recurrent formulas for KL
polynomials for maximal parabolic subgroups (geometrically, this case
corresponds to Grassmanians), due to Lascoux-Schutzenberger and Zelevinsky.

incompatibility between quantum mechanics and elements of reality.

transmission in the nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) format over transoceanic distance.
The system operates in a small group velocity dispersion regime, and the model
equation is given by the Whitham equations describing the slow modulation of
multi-phase wavetrains of the (defocusing) nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS)
equation. The model equation is of hyperbolic type, and certain initial NRZ
pulse with phase modulation develops a shock. We then show how one can obtain a
global solution by choosing an appropriate Riemann surface on which the Whitham
equation is defined. The present analysis may be interpreted as an alternative
to the method of inverse scattering transformation for the NLS solitons. We
also discuss wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in the NRZ format by using
the Whitham equation for a coupled NLS equation, and show that there exists a
hydro-dynamic-type instability between channels.
