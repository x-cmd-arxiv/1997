multi-attractor regimes with final state sensitivity with respect to small

evolving scalar field currently dominates the energy density of the Universe.
Such models have been shown to share the advantages of $\Lambda$ models:
compatibility with the spatial flatness predicted inflation; a Universe older
than the standard Einstein-de Sitter model; and, combined with cold dark
matter, predictions for large-scale structure formation in good agreement with
data from galaxy surveys. Compared to the cosmological constant, these scalar
field models are consistent with the SNe observations for a lower matter
density, $\Omega_{m0} \sim 0.2$, and a higher age, $H_0 t_0 \gtrsim 1$.
Combined with the fact that scalar field models imprint a distinctive signature
on the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, they remain currently viable and
should be testable in the near future.

for the analytic continuation of such a non-convergent series by harmonic
inversion of the ""time"" signal, which is the Fourier transform of g(w). We
demonstrate the general applicability and accuracy of the method on two
different systems with completely different properties: the Riemann zeta
function and the three disk scattering system. The Riemann zeta function serves
as a mathematical model for a bound system. We demonstrate that the method of
harmonic inversion by filter-diagonalization yields several thousand zeros of
the zeta function to about 12 digit precision as eigenvalues of small matrices.
However, the method is not restricted to bound and ergodic systems, and does
not require the knowledge of the mean staircase function, i.e., the Weyl term
in dynamical systems, which is a prerequisite in many semiclassical
quantization conditions. It can therefore be applied to open systems as well.
We demonstrate this on the three disk scattering system, as a physical example.
The general applicability of the method is emphasized by the fact that one does
not have to resort a symbolic dynamics, which is, in turn, the basic
requirement for the application of cycle expansion techniques.

in the single-step growth model. We employ the mapping to the asymmetric
exclusion model with blockage, and using Bethe-Ansatz eigenfunctions as a
starting approximation we are able to solve this problem analytically in
two-particle sector. The dip caused by the defect is computed. A simple
renormalization group-like argument enables to study scaling of the dip with
increasing length of the sample L; the RG mapping is calculated approximately
using the analytical results for small samples. For a horizontal surface we
found that the surface is only weakly pinned at the inhomogeneity; the dip
scales as a power law L^\gamma with \gamma= 0.58496. The value of the exponent
agrees with direct numerical simulations of the inhomogeneous single-step
growth model. In the case of tilted surfaces we observe a phase transition
between weak and strong pinning and the exponent in the weak pinning regime
depends on the tilt.

going like $v^{4-n}/r^{7-p+n}$ corresponding to interactions between the
different components of the D-brane supermultiplet. From the eleven dimensional
point of view, these potentials arise from the exchange of field strengths
corresponding to the graviton and the three form, coupled non-minimally to the

contribution is enough to reproduce these next-to-leading effects, meaning in
particular that the one-loop (M)atrix theory effective action should encode all
the spin dependence of low-energy supergravity interactions.

Universally, the limiting geometry is the direct product of two 2-dimensional
spaces and is characterized by just a few parameters. We argue that the quantum
corrections to the entropy of such extremal black holes due to a massless
scalar field have a universal behavior. We obtain explicitly the form of the
quantum entropy in this extremal limit as function of the parameters of the
limiting geometry. We generalize these results to black holes with toroidal or
higher genus horizon topologies. In general, the extreme quantum entropy is
completely determined by the spectral geometry of the horizon and in the
ultra-extreme case it is just a determinant of the 2-dimensional Laplacian. As
a byproduct of our considerations we obtain expressions for the quantum entropy
of black holes which are not of the Reissner-Nordstrom type: the extreme
dilaton and extreme Kerr-Newman black holes. In both cases the classical
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified by logarithmic corrections.

particles furthest from the origin reaches the speed of light, the number of
states tends to zero. We illustrate how one can also interpret this partition
function as the effective action for a boosted scalar field configuration in
the product of three dimensional de Sitter space and $S^1$. In this case, we
consider the number of states with a fixed linear momentum around the $S^1$ as
the particles are given more and more boost momentum. At the critical point
when the spacetime is about to develop closed timelike curves, the number of
states again tends to zero. Thus it seems that quantum mechanics naturally
enforces the chronology protection conjecture by superselecting the causality
violating field configurations from the quantum mechanical phase space.

respect to spontaneous fission as the proton number Z increases, because of the
disruptive effect of the long-range Coulomb force. However, in the region just
beyond Z = 100 magic proton and neutron numbers and the associated shell
structure enhances nuclear stability sufficiently to allow observation of
additional nuclei. Some thirty years ago it was speculated that an island of
spherical, relatively stable superheavy nuclei would exist near the next doubly
magic proton-neutron combination beyond 208:Pb, that is, at proton number Z =
114 and neutron number N = 184. Theory and experiment now show that there also
exists a rock of stability in the vicinity of Z = 110 and N = 162 between the
actinide region, which previously was the end of the peninsula of known
elements, and the predicted island of spherical superheavy nuclei slightly
southwest of the magic numbers Z = 114 and N = 184. We review here the
stability properties of the heavy region of nuclei. Just as the decay
properties of nuclei in the heavy region depend strongly on shell structure,
this structure also dramatically affects the fusion entrance channel. The six
most recently discovered new elements were all formed in cold-fusion reactions.
We discuss here the effect of the doubly magic structure of the target in
cold-fusion reactions on the fusion barrier and on dissipation.
