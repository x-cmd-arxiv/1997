1.8 have shown a remarkable variety of structures, generally aligned along the
radio axis, indicating that the radio source strongly influences the optical
appearance of these galaxies. In this paper we investigate the host galaxies
underlying this aligned emission, combining the HST data with ground-based
infrared images. An investigation of the spectral energy distributions of the
galaxies shows that the contribution of the aligned blue component to the
K--band light is generally small (about 10%). The radial intensity profiles of
the galaxies are well matched at radii <~ 35 kpc by de Vaucouleurs' law,
demonstrating that the K--band light is dominated by that of an elliptical
galaxy. There is no evidence for a nuclear point source, in addition to the de
Vaucouleurs profile, with a contribution >~15% of the total K--band flux
density, except in two cases, 3C22 and 3C41. Large characteristic radii are
derived, indicating that the 3CR galaxies must be highly evolved dynamically,
even at a redshift of one. At radii > 35 kpc, a combined galaxy profile clearly
shows an excess of emission reminiscent of cD--type halos. This supports other
independent evidence for the hypothesis that the distant 3CR galaxies lie in
moderately rich (proto--)clusters. Since the nearby FR II galaxies in the 3CR
catalogue lie in more diffuse environments and do not possess cD halos, the
galactic environments of the 3CR galaxies must change with redshift. The K-z
relation of the 3CR galaxies cannot, therefore, be interpreted using a standard
`closed-box, passive stellar evolution' model. We offer a new interpretation,
and compare the model with the K-z relations of lower power radio galaxies and
brightest cluster galaxies. (abridged)

X-ray variability. In this source, our method probes the power spectrum in the

factor of over 50 compared to previous studies. The ASCA data out a cessation
of variability up to 0.016 Hz at greater than 90% confidence. The power-law
index of the power spectrum is consistent with -1.4.At 0.021 Hz we can place an
upper limit of 7% on the intrinsic fluctuations of the source luminosity at

dominant but we can place an upper limit of 10% on intrinsic fluctuations up to

unique new constraints on afterglow models. The quenching of diffractive
scintillation at 4 week delay provides the first direct estimate of source size
and expansion rate. It implies an apparent size $R\sim10^{17}$cm and expansion
at a speed comparable to that of light at 4 weeks delay, in agreement with the
fireball model prediction $R=10^{17}(t/week)^{5/8}$cm. The radio flux and its
dependence on time and frequency at 1--5 week delay are in agreement with the
model and imply a fireball energy (assuming spherical symmetry) of order
10^{52}erg, consistent with the value inferred from observations at shorter
delay. The observed radio behavior deviates from model predictions at delays
larger than 5 weeks. This is expected, since at this delay the fireball is in
transition from highly-relativistic to sub-relativistic expansion, with Lorentz
factor \gamma<2. Deviation may be due to a change in the physical processes
associated with the shock wave as it becomes sub-relativistic (e.g. a decrease
in the fraction of energy carried by magnetic field), or to the fireball being
a cone of opening angle $1/\gamma\sim0.5$. We predict the future behavior of
the radio flux assuming that the latter interpretation is valid. These
predictions may be tested by radio observations in the frequency range
0.1--10GHz on time scale of months.

extrapolation of that approximation suggests that the gravitational collapse
along all three directions which eventually leads to the formation of real
virialized objects - clumps occur in the regions where the lowest eigenvalue of
the deformation tensor,lambda_{3}, is positive. We derive the conditional
probability of lambda_{3}>0 as a function of the linearly extrapolated density
contrast, delta, and the conditional probability distribution of delta provided
that lambda_{3}>0. These two conditional probability distributions show that
the most probable density of the bound regions (lambda_{3}>0) is roughly 1.5 at
the characteristic mass scale, and that the probability of lambda_{3}>0 is
almost unity in the highly overdense regions (delta>3*sigma). Finally an
analytic mass function of clumps is derived with a help of one simple ansatz
which is employed to treat the multistream regions beyond the validity of the
Zel'dovich approximation. The resulting mass function is renormalized by a
factor of 12.5, which we justify with a sharp k-space filter by means of the

Semiclassical states are considered then as Gaussian wave packets in the
functional Schrodinger representation and as Gaussian vectors in the Fock
representation. We consider the problem of divergences and renormalization in
the semiclassical field theory in the Hamiltonian formulation. Although
divergences in quantum field theory are usually associated with loop Feynman
graphs, divergences in the Hamiltonian approach may arise even at the tree
level. For example, formally calculated probability of pair creation in the
leading order of the semiclassical expansion may be divergent. This observation
was interpretted as an argumentation for considering non-unitary evolution
transformations, as well as non-equivalent representations of canonical
commutation relations at different time moments. However, we show that this
difficulty can be overcomed without the assumption about non-unitary evolution.
We consider first the Schrodinger equation for the regularized field theory
with ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs. We study the problem of making a limit
to the local theory. To consider such a limit, one should impose not only the
requirement on the counterterms entering to the quantum Hamiltonian but also
the requirement on the initial state in the theory with cutoffs. We find such a
requirement in the leading order of the semiclassical expansion and show that
it is invariant under time evolution. This requirement is also presented as a
condition on the quadratic form entering to the Gaussian state.

  Asymptotic Analysis 1997.5.20 -- 5.23. LaTex, 15 pages",,,,"patt-sol hep-th nlin.PS",,"  We give a comprehensive review of the renormalization group method for global
and asymptotic analysis, putting an emphasis on the relevance to the classical
theory of envelopes and the existence of invariant manifolds of the dynamics
under consideration. We clarify that an essential point of the method is to
convert the problem from solving differential equations to obtaining suitable
initial (or boundary) conditions.
  We mention that the notion of envelopes is also useful for constructing
global and asymptotic behavior of wave functions of quantum systems such as the
ones with the quartic potential or double-well potential.

prepared in a pure state localized on the STM surface at 0 temperature is
investigated by numerically integrating the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation. In these calculations the environmental interactions are neglected,
and voltage pulses of 20 and 7 ns with symmetric triangular and trapezoidal
shapes are considered. The atom dynamics at an environmental temperature of 4 K
is studied in the frame of a stochastic, non-linear Liouville equation for the
density operator. It is shown that the irreversible transfer from surface to
tip may be explained by thermal decoherence rather than by the driving force
acting during the application of the voltage pulse.

$P_m:=\sum_{u\ge2}\beta_{m,u}$, the conjecture leads to the sequence
$$1,1,1,2,3,5,8,12,18,27,39,55,\underline{78,108,150,207,284,388,532,726}$$ for

are motivated by successful enumerations of irreducible Euler sums. Predictions

fails to detect an invariant in each case.

the full inhomogeneous (multiparametric) quantum group ISO_{q,r}(N), and do
contain dilatations.
  If we require bicovariance only under the quantum orthogonal group
SO_{q,r}(N), the calculus on the q-plane can be expressed in terms of its
coordinates x^a, differentials dx^a and partial derivatives \partial_a without
the need of dilatations, thus generalizing known results to the multiparametric
case. Using real forms that lead to the signature (n+1,m) with m = n-1, n, n+1
, we find ISO_{q,r}(n+1, m) and SO_{q,r}(n+1,m) bicovariant calculi on the
multiparametric quantum spaces. The particular case of the quantum Minkowski
space ISO_{q,r}(3,1)/SO_{q,r}(3,1) is treated in detail.
  The conjugated partial derivatives \partial_a* can be expressed as linear
combinations of the \partial_a. This allows a deformation of the phase-space
where no additional operators (besides x^a and p_a) are needed.

nonlinear physical systems which have revolutionized our understanding of them.
Highly stable exponentially localized solitons are often associated with many
of the important integrable nonlinear systems while motions which are
sensitively dependent on initial conditions are associated with chaotic
systems. Besides dramatically raising our perception of many natural phenomena,
these concepts are opening up new vistas of applications and unfolding
technologies: Optical soliton based information technology, magnetoelectronics,
controlling and synchronization of chaos and secure communications, to name a
few. These developments have raised further new interesting questions and
potentialities. We present a particular view of some of the challenging
problems and payoffs ahead in the next few decades by tracing the early
historical events, summarizing the revolutionary era of 1950-70 when many
important new ideas including solitons and chaos were realized and reviewing
the current status. Important open problems both at the basic and applied
levels are discussed.
