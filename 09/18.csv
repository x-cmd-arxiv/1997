consistent with a static Euclidean universe, rather than with Friedmann models,
and past authors have disagreed as to what effects are responsible. These
results may be due to a variety of selection effects, different sample
definitions, and inconsistencies in the analysis undermining the results. Using
the VLA FIRST survey, we investigate the theta-z relation for a new sample of
103 double-lobed quasars, carefully addressing the various potential problems
which, we believe, have compromised past work. Before focusing on cosmological
constraints, we investigate the possible impact of correlations among the
intrinsic properties of these sources over the entire assumed range of allowed
cosmological parameter values. For all cases, we find only mild apparent size
evolution which is found to arise mainly from a power-size correlation coupled
with a power-redshift correlation; intrinsic size evolution is consistent with
zero. We also find that in all cases, an evolution-free subsample can be
defined, whose theta-z relation should arise mainly from cosmological effects.
Contrary to past work, we find that the observed theta-z relation for our
sample is more consistent with standard Friedmann models than with a static
Euclidean universe. In particular, we find that a flat, matter-dominated
universe, a flat universe with a cosmological constant, and an open universe
all provide comparably good fits to the data, with the latter two models both
yielding Omega_0 \approx 0.35 with 1-sigma ranges including values between \sim
0.25 and 1.0; the evolution-free subsamples yield values of Omega_0 near unity,

Attractor itself. This is understood taking into account that the integrated
effect is produced by the variations of the gravitational potential, which seem
to be important in large regions subtending angular scales of various degrees.
As a result of the large size of these regions, the spatial curvature of the

and 80 atoms bound by the Morse potential as a function of the range of the
interatomic force. The effect of decreasing the range is to destabilize
strained structures, and hence the global minimum changes from icosahedral to
decahedral to face-centred-cubic as the range is decreased. For N>45 the global
minima associated with a long-ranged potential have polytetrahedral structures
involving defects called disclination lines. For the larger clusters the
network of disclination lines is disordered and the global minimum has an
amorphous structure resembling a liquid. The size evolution of polytetrahedral
packings enables us to study the development of bulk liquid structure in finite
systems. As many experiments on the structure of clusters only provide indirect
structural information, these results will be very useful in aiding the
interpretation of experiment. They also provide candidate structures for
theoretical studies using more specific and computationally expensive
descriptions of the interatomic interactions. Furthermore, Morse clusters
provide a rigorous testing ground for global optimization methods.

considering as initial condition the highest frequency mode. Above an
analytically derived energy threshold, this zone-boundary mode is shown to be
modulationally unstable and to give rise to a striking localization process.
The spontaneously created excitations have strong similarity with moving exact
breathers solutions. But they have a finite lifetime and their dynamics is
chaotic. These chaotic breathers are able to collect very efficiently the
energy in the chain. Therefore their size grows in time and they can transport
a very large quantity of energy. These features can be explained analyzing the
dynamics of perturbed exact breathers of the FPU chain. In particular, a close
connection between the Lyapunov spectrum of the chaotic breathers and the
Floquet spectrum of the exact ones has been found. The emergence of chaotic
breathers is convincingly explained by the absorption of high frequency phonons
whereas a breather's metastability is for the first time identified. The
lifetime of the chaotic breather is related to the time necessary for the
system to reach equipartition. The equipartition time turns out to be dependent
on the system energy density $\epsilon$ only. Moreover, such time diverges as
$\epsilon^{-2}$ in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ and vanishes as $\epsilon^{-1/4}$
for $\epsilon \to \infty$.

collected in ``samples'' defined by the trajectories in the Earth of the

the full sample of neutrinos detected at night, the sample of night neutrinos
which cross the Earth core and the sample of night neutrinos which does not
cross the Earth core. For energy integrated event rates, the day-night
asymmetry for core crossing neutrinos is up to six times bigger than the
day-night asymmetry for the full sample of night neutrinos. When the reduction
in statistics is considered, an effective enhancement up to a factor $\approx
2.3$ is obtained. The selection of core crossing neutrinos may be relevant for

the Super Kamiokande detector be able to constrain the small mixing angle

dynamical supersymmetry breaking. The models do not have gauge singlet fields.
The Standard Model gauge group is embedded in the global symmetry of the SUSY
breaking sector. At the renormalizable level the models possess a set of
classical flat directions. Only one of those flat directions is unlifted by
quantum effects, and requires nonrenormalizable term to stabilize the potential
for the corresponding modulus. Large vacuum expectation value of this modulus
at the minimum of the potential generates mass terms for the messenger fields.
There are no light messengers, thus this class of models evades difficulties
encountered in earlier constructions using nonrenormalizable models.

we introduced a self-adjoint operator $\hat {{\cal T}}(X)$ whose eigenstates
can be used to define consistently a probability distribution of the time of
arrival at a given spatial point. In the present work we show that the
probability distribution previously proposed can be well understood on
classical grounds in the sense that it is given by the expectation value of a
certain positive definite operator $\hat J^{(+)}(X)$ which is nothing but a
straightforward quantum version of the modulus of the classical current. For
quantum states highly localized in momentum space about a certain momentum $p_0
\neq 0$, the expectation value of $\hat J^{(+)}(X)$ becomes indistinguishable
from the quantum probability current. This fact may provide a justification for
the common practice of using the latter quantity as a probability distribution
of arrival times.

integer and half-integer spins persists. In a quasi-classical description this
difference enters via Berry's connection. This general phenomenon is derived
and illustrated for large spins confined to a plane by crystalline electric
fields. Physical realizations are rare-earth Nickel Borocarbides. Magnetic
moments for half-integer spin
  (Dy$^{3+}$, $J=15/2$) and magnetic susceptibilities for integer spin
(Ho$^{3+}$, $J=8$) are calculated. Experiments are proposed to furnish evidence
for the predicted fundamental difference.

the notion of $r$--matrix hierarchies. One of its basic features is the
coincidence of Lax matrices of discretized systems with the Lax matrices of the
underlying continuous time systems. A common feature of the discretizations
obtained in this approach is non--locality. We demonstrate how to overcome this
drawback. Namely, we introduce the notion of localizing changes of variables
and construct such changes of variables for a large number of examples,
including the Toda and the relativistic Toda lattices, the Volterra lattice and
its integrable perturbation, the second flows of the Toda and of the Volterra
hierarchies, the modified Volterra lattice, the Belov-Chaltikian lattice, the
Bogoyavlensky lattices, the Bruschi-Ragnisco lattice. We also introduce a novel
class of constrained lattice KP systems, discretize all of them, and find the
corresponding localizing change of variables. Pulling back the differential
equations of motion under the localizing changes of variables, we find also
(sometimes novel) integrable one-parameter perturbations of integrable lattice
systems. Poisson properties of the localizing changes of variables are also
studied: they produce interesting one-parameter deformations of the known
Poisson algebras.
