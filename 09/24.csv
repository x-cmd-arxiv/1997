amorphous solid state exhibit certain universal characteristics. Chief among
these are the fraction of particles that are randomly localized and the scaling
functions that describe the order parameter and (equivalently) the statistical
distribution of localization lengths for these localized particles. The purpose
of this Paper is to discuss the origins and consequences of this universality,
and in doing so, three themes are explored. First, a replica-Landau-type
approach is formulated for the universality class of systems that are composed
of extended objects connected by permanent random constraints and undergo
amorphous solidification at a critical density of constraints. This formulation
generalizes the cases of randomly cross-linked and end-linked macromolecular
systems, discussed previously. The universal replica free energy is
constructed, in terms of the replica order parameter appropriate to amorphous
solidification, the value of the order parameter is obtained in the liquid and
amorphous solid states, and the chief universal characteristics are determined.
Second, the theory is reformulated in terms of the distribution of local static
density fluctuations rather than the replica order parameter. It is shown that
a suitable free energy can be constructed, depending on the distribution of
static density fluctuations, and that this formulation yields precisely the
same conclusions as the replica approach. Third, the universal predictions of
the theory are compared with the results of extensive numerical simulations of
randomly cross-linked macromolecular systems, due to Barsky and Plischke, and
excellent agreement is found.

the framework of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian augmented by short range
extended Hubbard interactions. Within a strong electron-electron correlation
approximation, the exciton properties are extensively studied. Using scattering
theory, we analytically obtain the exciton energy and wavefunction and derive a
criterion for the existence of a $B_u$ exciton. We also systematically
investigate the effect of impurities on the coherent motion of an exciton. The
coherence is measured by a suitably defined electron-hole correlation function.
It is shown that, for impurities with an on-site potential, a crossover
behavior will occur if the impurity strength is comparable to the bandwidth of
the exciton, corresponding to exciton localization. For a charged impurity with
a spatially extended potential, in addition to localization the exciton will
dissociate into an uncorrelated electron-hole pair when the impurity is
sufficiently strong to overcome the Coulomb interaction which binds the
electron-hole pair. Interchain coupling effects are also discussed by
considering two polymer chains coupled through nearest-neighbor interchain
hopping $t_{\perp}$ and interchain Coulomb interaction $V_{\perp}$. Within the
$t$ matrix scattering formalism, for every center-of-mass momentum, we find two
poles determined only by $V_{\perp}$, which correspond to the interchain
excitons. Finally, the exciton state is used to study the charge transfer from
a polymer chain to an adjacent dopant molecule.

different temperatures $T_x$ and $T_y$. The system undergoes an order-disorder
phase transition as $T_x$ ($T_y$) is varied for sufficiently low fixed $T_y$

critical behaviour belongs to the Ising universality class. The measure of

calculations of the unsubtracted Green's functions at zero momentum in

mechanics and field theory in which the large cut-off limit is obtained by
letting beta reach a critical value beta_c (with up to 16 significant digits in
our actual calculations). We show that the round-off errors on the magnetic
susceptibility grow like (beta_c -beta)^{-1} near criticality. We show that the
systematic errors (finite truncations and volume) can be controlled with an
exponential precision and reduced to a level lower than the numerical errors.
We justify the use of the truncation for calculations of the high-temperature
expansion. We calculate the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant
corresponding to the 4-point function and show that when beta -> beta_c, this
quantity tends to a fixed value which can be determined accurately when D=3

a discrete time-translation symmetry we use analytical methods to establish
that, for Killing frequency $\omega$ and surface gravity $\kappa$ satisfying
$\kappa\ll\omega^{1/3}\ll 1$ in lattice units, the continuum Hawking spectrum
is recovered. The low frequency outgoing modes arise from exotic ingoing modes
with large proper wavevectors that ""refract"" off the horizon. In this model
with time translation symmetry the proper lattice spacing goes to zero at
spatial infinity. We also consider instead falling lattices whose proper
lattice spacing is constant at infinity and therefore grows with time at any
finite radius. This violation of time translation symmetry is visible only at
wavelengths comparable to the lattice spacing, and it is responsible for
transmuting ingoing high Killing frequency modes into low frequency outgoing
modes.

the maximum entropy of a vacuum-bounded state with a given energy for a

large energies we show that a vacuum-bounded system with length $L_in$ and a
given energy has entropy no more than $S^rb + (1/6) \ln S^rb$, where $S^rb$ is
the entropy in a rigid box with the same size and energy. Assuming that the
state resulting from the evaporation of a black hole is similar to a
vacuum-bounded state, and that the similarity between vacuum-bounded and rigid
box problems extends from 1 to 3 dimensions, we apply these results to the
black hole information paradox. Under these assumptions we conclude that large
amounts of information cannot be emitted in the final explosion of a black
hole.
  We also consider vacuum-bounded states at very low energies and come to the
surprising conclusion that the entropy of such a state can be much higher than
that of a rigid box state with the same energy. For a fixed $E$ we let $L_in'$
be the length of a rigid box which gives the same entropy as a vacuum-bounded
state of length $L_in$. In the $E\to 0$ limit we conjecture that the ratio

\to N + N^{*}$, $N^{*} + N \to N + N$ and $N^{*} + N \to N^{*} + N$ cross
sections in cold nuclear matter up to twice the nuclear matter density. The
influence of different choices of the $N^{*}N^{*}$ coupling strengths, which
can not be obtained through fitting certain experimental data, are discussed.
The results show that the density dependence of predicted in-medium cross
sections are sensitive to the $N^{*}N^{*}$ coupling strengths used. An evident
density dependence will appear when a large scalar coupling strength of
$g_{N^{*}N^{*}}^{\sigma}$ is assumed.

spiral-wave pairs along uniformly propagating fronts. The analysis of
spiral-wave nucleation reduces to the simpler problem of droplet, or domain,
nucleation in one space dimension.

(AX)n, with n less than or equal to 10, A=Li, Na, K, Rb and X=F, Cl, Br, I, are
studied using the ab initio Perturbed Ion (aiPI) model and a restricted
structural relaxation criterion. A trend of competition between rock-salt and
hexagonal ring-like isomers is found and discussed in terms of the relative
ionic sizes. The main conclusion is that an approximate value of r_C/r_A=0.5
(where r_C and r_A are the cationic and anionic radii) separates the hexagonal
from the rock-salt structures. The classical electrostatic part of the total
energy at the equilibrium geometry is enough to explain these trends. The magic
numbers in the size range studied are n= 4, 6 and 9, and these are universal
since they occur for all alkali-halides and do not depend on the specific
ground state geometry. Instead those numbers allow for the formation of compact
clusters. Full geometrical relaxations are considered for (LiF)n (n=3-7) and
(AX)_3 clusters, and the effect of Coulomb correlation is studied in a few
selected cases. These two effects preserve the general conclusions achieved
thus far.

The Hamiltonian is
given by the Laplace -- Beltrami operator on the group manifold, and the
purpose is to get the (Feynman's) evolution kernel. The spectral expansion,
which produced a series of the representation characters for the evolution
kernel in the compact case, does not exist for non-compact group, where the
spectrum is not bounded. In this work real analytical groups are investigated,
some of which are of interest for physics. An integral representation for the
evolution operator is obtained in terms of the Green function, i.e. the
solution to the Helmholz equation on the group manifold. The alternative series
expressions for the evolution operator are reconstructed from the same integral
representation, the spectral expansion (when exists) and the sum over classical
paths. For non-compact groups, the latter can be interpreted as the (exact)
semi-classical approximation, like in the compact case. The explicit form of
the evolution operator is obtained for a number of non-compact groups.
