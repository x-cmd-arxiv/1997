elliptical galaxies (dEs). The BCDs are flatter, on average, than the dEs, but
the difference is only marginally significant. We then use both non-parametric

shapes for the BCDs. The hypothesis that BCDs are oblate spheroids can be ruled
out with a high confidence level ($> 99%$), but the hypothesis that they are
prolate spheroids cannot be excluded. The apparent shapes of BCDs are totally
consistent with the hypothesis that they are triaxial ellipsoids. If the
intrinsic axis ratios, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, are distributed according to a
Gaussian with means $\beta_0$ and $\gamma_0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$,
we find the best-fitting distribution for BCDs has $(\beta_0,\gamma_0,\sigma)=
(0.66,0.55,0.16)$, while that for dEs has $(\beta_0,\gamma_0,\sigma)=
(0.85,0.64,0.24)$. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that BCDs
have a close evolutionary relation with dEs.

diffusion, whereas the initial lepton gradient is maintained by electron
capture and neutrino escape near the neutrinosphere. Despite the maintenance of
the lepton gradient, protoneutron star convection does not develop over the 100

transport that simultaneously (a) is multigroup and (b) simulates with greater
realism the transport of neutrinos in opaque, semitransparent, and transparent
regions. Both are crucial to the accurate determination of postshock neutrino
heating, which sensitively depends on the luminosities, spectra, and flux
factors of the electron neutrinos and antineutrinos emerging from their
respective neutrinospheres. By 212 ms after bounce, we see large-scale,
neutrino-driven convection beneath the shock, characterized by higher-entropy,
expanding upflows and denser, lower-entropy, finger-like downflows. The radial
convection velocities at this time become supersonic just below the shock,
reaching magnitudes in excess of 10^{9} cm/sec. Eventually, however, the shock
recedes to smaller radii, and at 500 ms after bounce there is no evidence in
our simulation of an explosion. While vigorous, neutrino-driven convection in

had recently been claimed that the commonly used relation between observation

also imply an apparent source size which is too large to allow attributing
observed radio variability to diffractive scintillation. We present a detailed

also turned out to be of intermediate age. This, combined with the fact that
they lie far out in the disk, yields interesting constraints regarding the
formation and evolution of the LMC disk. We also study the age distribution of
intermediate age and old clusters This homogeneous set of accurate relative

the new and existing data for the galactic GCs and comparing the $(U-R)$ colors

  We find that the M87 GCs span a wide range in metallicity, from very metal
poor to somewhat above solar metallicity. The mean [Fe/H] of -0.95 dex is
higher than that of the galactic GC system, and there is a metal rich tail that
reaches to higher [Fe/H] than one finds among the galactic GCs. The mean
metallicity of the M87 GC system is about a factor of four lower than that of
the M87 stellar halo at a fixed projected radius $R$. The metallicity inferred
from the X-ray studies is similar to that of the M87 stellar halo, not to that
of GCs. We infer the relative abundances of Na, Mg, and Fe in the M87 GCs from
the strength of their spectral features. The behavior of these elements between
the metal rich and metal poor M87 GCs is similar to that shown by the galactic
GCs and by halo stars in the Galaxy. The pattern of chemical evolution in these
disparate old stellar systems is indistinguishable. We obtain a median age for
the M87 GC system of 13 Gyr, similar to that of the galactic GCs, with a small
dispersion about this value.

inequivalence. Moreover, to highlight both the peculiarities of the methods and
the analogies between them, we work out two concrete applications to the study

excitation spectrum.
  Our results show that, while any small amount of the anisotropy is enough to
stabilize the domain walls against the quantum fluctuations, no boundary
condition exists that would stabilize a domain wall in the isotropic model
(Delta=1).

  Many typos corrected. One figure deleted, one replaced",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  A microscopic model for analyzing the microwave absorption properties of a
pinned, two-dimensional Wigner crystal in a strong perpendicular magnetic field
is developed. The method focuses on excitations within the lowest Landau level,
and corresponds to a quantum version of the harmonic approximation. For pure
systems (no disorder), the method reproduces known results for the collective
mode density of states of this system, and clearly identifies the origin of
previously unexplained structure in this quantity. The application of the
method to a simple diagonal disorder model uncovers a surprising result: a
sharp (delta-function) response at zero temperature that is consistent with
recent experiments. A simple spin lattice model is developed that reproduces
the results of the quantum harmonic approximation, and shows that the sharp
response is possible because the size scale $L_c$ of patches moving together in
the lowest frequency collective mode is extremely large compared to the sample
size for physically relevant parameters. This result is found to be a direct
repercussion of the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. Finally, the
model is used to analyze different disorder potentials that may pin the Wigner
crystal, and it is argued that interface disorder is likely to represent the
dominant pinning source for the system. A simple model of the interface is
shown to reproduce some of the experimental trends for the magnetic field
dependence of the pinning resonance.

the dynamical behavior of superconducting vortices undergoing avalanches. In
particular, we quantify the effect of the pinning landscape on the macroscopic
properties of vortex avalanches and vortex plastic flow. These dynamical
instabilities are triggered when the external magnetic field is increased
slightly, and are thus driven by a flux gradient rather than by thermal
effects. The flux profiles, composed of rigid flux lines that interact with 100
or more vortices, are maintained in the Bean critical state and do not decay
away from it. By directly determining vortex positions during avalanches in the
plastically moving lattice, we find that experimentally observable voltage
bursts correspond to the pulsing movement of vortices along branched channels
or winding chains in a manner reminiscent of lightning strikes. This kind of
motion cannot be described by elastic theories. We relate the velocity field
and cumulative patterns of vortex flow channels with statistical quantities,
such as distributions of avalanche sizes. Samples with a high density of strong
pinning sites produce very broad avalanche distributions. Easy-flow vortex
channels appear in samples with a low pinning density, and typical avalanche
sizes emerge in an otherwise broad distribution of sizes. We observe a
crossover from interstitial motion in narrow channels to pin-to-pin motion in
broad channels as pin density is increased. Videos available at

thought experiment to measure energy density is analyzed in some detail, and
the operational positivity is clearly manifested.
  If operational energy conditions do hold for quantum fields, then the
negative energy densities predicted by theory have a will-o'-the-wisp
character: any local attempt to verify a total negative energy density will be
self-defeating on account of quantum measurement difficulties. Similarly,
attempts to drive exotic effects (wormholes, violations of the second law,
etc.) by such densities may be defeated by quantum measurement problems. As an
example, I show that certain attempts to violate the Cosmic Censorship
principle by negative energy densities are defeated.

that involve only high frequency perturbations in vacuo, and formulate the back
reaction problem in a gauge invariant manner for completely generic
perturbations. We give a quick proof that the EEMT for high-frequency
perturbations is gauge invariant which greatly simplifies the pioneering
approach by Isaacson. As applications we analyze the back reaction of
gravitational waves and scalar metric fluctuations in
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background spacetimes. We investigate in particular
back reaction effects during inflation in the Chaotic scenario. Fluctuations
with a wavelength much bigger than the Hubble radius during inflation
contribute a negative energy density, and in that case back reaction
counteracts any pre-existing cosmological constant. Finally, we set up the
equations of motion for the back reaction on the geometry and on the matter,

continuity equations.

hydrogen/deuterium mixtures by direct measurement of q_1s, the probability that
a mu-p atom, which is initially formed in an excited state, reaches the 1s
ground state. The dependence of q_1s on deuterium concentration c_d was
measured for two different densities at cryogenic temperatures using charge
coupled devices (CCDs) to detect the muonic X rays. First results based on the
analysis of the K_alpha-lines of the two isotopes are presented.

shows some interesting patterns which are closely related to searching.

assumption. Unlike Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality [or Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
(CHSH) inequality] which is violated by quantum mechanics by a factor of $\sqrt
2$, this inequality is violated by a factor of 1.5. Thus the magnitude of
violation of this inequality is approximately 20.7% larger than the magnitude
of violation of previous inequalities. Moreover, unlike CH (or CHSH) inequality
which requires the measurement of five detection probabilities, the present
inequality requires the measurement of only two detection probabilities. This
inequality can therefore be used to test locality more simply than CH or CHSH
inequality.
