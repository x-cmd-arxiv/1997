are found only in ellipticals or recent merger events. We report B,R,J, and K
imaging, optical spectroscopy, a rotation curve, an IRAS detection, and a VLA
20cm image for this galaxy, 0313-192. The optical and NIR images clearly show a
disk. We detect apparent spiral arms and a dust-lane from B band imaging. The
reddened nucleus is consistent with extinction by a similar dust-lane. The
optical spectrum suggests a central AGN and some evidence of a starburst, with
both the AGN and central starlight appearing substantially reddened. From
analysis of the extended line emission in [OIII] and H-alpha we derive a
rotation curve consistent with an early- type, dusty spiral seen edge-on. From
the IRAS detection at 60 and 100 microns, we find that the ratio of Far IR to
radio flux places this object firmly as a radio galaxy (i.e. the radio emission
is not powered by star formation). The radio structure suggests that the radio
source in this galaxy is related to the same physical mechanisms present in
jet-fed powerful radio sources, and that such powerful, extended sources can
(albeit extremely rarely) occur in a disk-dominated host.

Laor & Netzer 1989: LN89). As a result of a more complete treatment of
absorptive opacity, we find greater overall spectral curvature than did LN89,

The local black body approximation is not a good description of the near UV
spectrum. With relativistic corrections (appropriate to non-rotating black
holes) included, we find that the near UV spectrum hardens with increasing
m-dot / m_8 (m-dot is the accretion rate in Eddington units, m_8 the black hole
mass in units of 10^8 M_Sun). The near UV spectrum is consistent with
observations if m-dot/ m_8 \sim 10^{-3}, but disks this cold would have large,
and unobserved, absorption features at the Lyman edge. The edge amplitude is
reduced when m-dot/m_8 is larger, but then the near-UV slope is too hard to
match observations. We conclude that models in which conventional disks orbit
non-rotating black holes do not adequately explain UV continuum production in

lacking. Contrary to such expectations, observational results show, in fact, a

main result of new analysis is that, contrary to the conclusion of standard

any crossover to homogeneity, but has fractal correlations (with dimension $D

consistent with statistical fluctuations. If, on the other hand, a spherical
model is used, systematic errors dominate. Even with our ``best-fit'' model,
there are a few rare experiments where the deviation between the measured and

fluctuations. In these experiments there is typically a clump of particles
crossing the line of sight to the hypothetical LMC. These clumps can be either
gravitationally bound systems or transient phenomena in a galaxy that is still

Amalia, for the linguistic formalism ALE, which is based on typed feature
structures. This formalism is one of the most widely accepted in computational
linguistics and has been used for designing grammars in various linguistic
theories, most notably HPSG. Amalia is composed of data structures and a set of
instructions, augmented by a compiler from the grammatical formalism to the
abstract instructions, and a (portable) interpreter of the abstract
instructions. The effect of each instruction is defined using a low-level
language that can be executed on ordinary hardware.
  The advantages of the abstract machine approach are twofold. From a
theoretical point of view, the abstract machine gives a well-defined
operational semantics to the grammatical formalism. This ensures that grammars
specified using our system are endowed with well defined meaning. It enables,
for example, to formally verify the correctness of a compiler for HPSG, given
an independent definition. From a practical point of view, Amalia is the first
system that employs a direct compilation scheme for unification grammars that
are based on typed feature structures. The use of amalia results in a much
improved performance over existing systems.
  In order to test the machine on a realistic application, we have developed a
small-scale, HPSG-based grammar for a fragment of the Hebrew language, using
Amalia as the development platform. This is the first application of HPSG to a
Semitic language.

the single-sharp-peak replication landscape we investigate the dependence of
the error threshold on the population size and find that the replication
accuracy at threshold increases linearly with the reciprocal of the population
size for sufficiently large populations. Furthermore, in the deterministic
limit our formulation yields the exact steady-state of the quasispecies model,

large momentum transfer is reviewed. That model is a variant of the
Brodsky-Lepage approach in which diquarks are considered as quasi-elementary
constituents of baryons. Recent applications of the diquark model, relevant to
high energy physics with electromagnetic probes, are discussed: electromagnetic
form factors of baryons in both the space-like and the time-like region,
two-photon annihilations into proton-antiproton pairs as well as real and
virtual Compton scattering.

mixing, the $\Delta I =1/2$ rule is numerically well satisfied. In addition,
and in contrast to previous calculations, we show that not only the relative
amplitudes are in good agreement with the empirical values but also their
absolute values. The issue of whether the strong interaction enhancement
factors should be included in soliton calculations is also addressed.

In comparison to parameters like alpha_em and M_Z it is relatively poorly

in recent years. More than twenty different types of process, from lattice QCD
studies to the highest energy colliders, can be used to measure alpha_s
accurately. The most precise determinations now quote uncertainties in
alpha_s(M_Z) of less than 5%. There is also a remarkable consistency between
the various measurements. The present review provides an update on alpha_s
measurements from the past year.

$T(z)$ is decomposed into $N$ components with different monodromy properties,
where $N$ is the number of branches in the realization of RS as branch covering
over the complex sphere. This decomposition gives rise to new infinite
dimensional Lie algebra which can be viewed as a generalization of Virasoro
algebra containing information about the global properties of the underlying
RS. In the simplest case of hyperelliptic curves the structure of the algebra
is calculated in two ways and its central extension is explicitly given. The
algebra possess an interesting symmetry with a clear interpretation in the
framework of the radial quantization of CFT's with multivalued fields on the
complex sphere.

no more complex than usual perturbation theory in lowest order. Relative to
discretized light cone quantization, the critical coupling increases by 30% to
a value r = 1.5. Conventional perturbation theory at the corresponding order
yields r_1=1, whereas the RG improved fourth order result is r_4 = 1.8 +-0.05.

quantum phase space we introduce the corresponding natural microcanonical and

differs from density matrix of the conventional approach. As an illustration,
the results are applied to the case of a spin one-half particle in a heat bath
