elliptic curves in P^n intersecting fixed general linear spaces and tangent to
a fixed hyperplane H with fixed multiplicities along fixed general linear
subspaces of H. As an application, we derive recursive formulas for the number
of such curves when the number is finite. These recursive formulas require as
``seed data'' only one input: there is one line in P^1 through two points.
These numbers can be seen as top intersection products of various cycles on the
Hilbert scheme of degree d rational or elliptic curves in P^n, or on certain
components of $\mbar_0(P^n,d)$ or $\mbar_1(P^n,d)$, and as such give
information about the Chow ring (and hence the topology) of these objects. The
formula can also be interpreted as an equality in the Chow ring (not
necessarily at the top level) of the appropriate Hilbert scheme or space of
stable maps. In particular, this gives an algorithm for counting rational and
elliptic curves in P^n intersecting various fixed general linear spaces. (The
genus 0 numbers were found earlier by Kontsevich-Manin, and the genus 1 numbers
were found for n=2 by Ran and Caporaso-Harris, and independently by Getzler for

Analysis of the color-restricted control-field-corrected color-magnitude

faintest dEs in this sample have a color (B-R) = 1.15 mag, which is within the
color range measured for the diffuse intracluster light. Analysis of the
completeness-corrected background-subtracted radial number density profiles
reveals that the faint dEs are deficient in the cluster core, consistent with
their destruction in this dense environment. To determine ages and abundances
for a subsample of these Coma dEs, we used the Keck I telescope and the

2x1800 sec exposures of four fields, with ~22 objects per field. Our wavelength

to 9-10 expected from analysis of the control-field CMD.

  Magellanic Cloud","to appear in the Astronomical Journal (abridged abstract below)",,"10.1086/118666",,"astro-ph",,"  We identify a vertical extension of the red clump stars in the color
magnitude diagram (CMD) of a section of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). After
subtracting the principal red clump component, we find a peak in the residual
stellar distribution that is ~ 0.9 mag brighter than the peak of the principal
red clump distribution. We consider and reject the following possible
explanations for this population: inhomogeneous reddening, Galactic disk stars,
random blends of red clump stars, correlated blends of red clump stars
(binaries), evolution of the red clump stars, and red clump stars from a
younger LMC stellar population. Combinations of these effects cannot be ruled
out as the origin of this stellar population. A natural interpretation of this
new population is that it consists of red clump stars that are closer to us
than those in the LMC. We find corroborating evidence for this interpretation
in Holtzman et al.'s (1997) Hubble Space Telescope CMD of the LMC field stars.
The derived distance and projected angular surface density of these stars
relative to the LMC stars (<~ 5 to 7%) are consistent with (1) models that
attribute the observed microlensing lensing optical depth (Alcock et al. 1997)
to a distinct foreground stellar population (Zhao 1997) and (2) tidal models of
the interaction between the LMC and the Milky Way (Lin, Jones, & Klemola 1995).
We conclude that the standard assumption of a smoothly distributed halo
population out to the LMC cannot be substantiated without at least a detailed
understanding of red clump stellar evolution, binary fractions, binary mass
ratios, the spatial correlation of stars within the LMC, possible variations in
the stellar populations of satellite galaxies, and differential reddening - all
of which are highly complex.

conjunction with the new ages derived for Globular Clusters using the same

to redshifts as high as $z=3.15$ (Lu, Sargent and Barlow 1997) an age for our

nu_parallle, which governs the relaxation time, is undefined, since the

was suggested that a ``designability principle'' plays a crucial role in
nature's selection of protein sequences and structures. Here we provide a
theoretical base for such a selection principle, using a novel formulation of
the protein folding problem based on hydrophobic interactions. A structure is
reduced to a string of 0's and 1's which represent the surface and core sites,
respectively, as the backbone is traced. Each structure is therefore associated
with one point in a high dimensional space. Sequences are represented by
strings of their hydrophobicities and thus can be mapped into the same space. A
sequence which lies closer to a particular structure in this space than to any
other structures will have that structure as its ground state. Atypical
structures, namely those far away from other structures in the high dimensional
space, have more sequences which fold into them, and are thermodynamically more
stable. We argue that the most common folds of proteins are the most atypical
in the space of possible structures.

addition to producing neutrinos (already the basis of several ongoing
experiments), is shown to lead to more significant heat generation in these
bodies for a uniform dark matter halo. This thermal output becomes more
prominent when clumped dark matter passes through the solar system. The dark
matter annihilations should be treated as a new source of heat in the solar
system which in some special cases may lead to unique imprints. Such new
signatures of the dark matter are found in the generation of the puzzling
magnetic field of Ganymede. This new source of heat perhaps cannot explain the
formation and segregation of Ganymedean structure (which are probably due to
conventional gravitational and radioactive heating), but provides a possible
explanation of the origin of the Ganymedean magnetic field.

to the holy grail function. The same phenomenon might occur in the QCD sector
of the theory and could be observed in the DIS experiments at HERA.

solutions called naked black holes. These black holes, which occur in string

concentration of dilaton stress-energy near the horizon. We study infalling
test strings and find that they are highly excited by the large tidal forces,
but remain small. Perhaps most importantly, it turns out that a small amount of
infalling matter will cause the curvature invariants to become large outside
the horizon. Nevertheless, an exact calculation shows that both the matter
trajectories and the classical black hole background are not significantly
altered.

SU(N) gauge theory, with a massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation
of the gauge group, are analyzed in terms of the elliptic Calogero-Moser
integrable system. A new parametrization for the Calogero-Moser spectral curves
is found, which exhibits the classical vacuum expectation values of the scalar
field of the gauge multiplet. The one-loop perturbative correction to the
effective prepotential is evaluated explicitly, and found to agree with quantum
field theory predictions. A renormalization group equation for the variation
with respect to the coupling is derived for the effective prepotential, and may
be evaluated in a weak coupling series using residue methods only. This gives a
simple and efficient algorithm for the instanton corrections to the effective
prepotential to any order. The 1- and 2- instanton corrections are derived
explicitly. Finally, it is shown that certain decoupling limits yield ${\cal
N}=2$ supersymmetric theories for simple gauge groups $SU(N_1)$ with
hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation, while others yield theories
for product gauge groups $SU(N_1) \times ...\times SU(N_p)$, with
hypermultiplets in fundamental and bi-fundamental representations. The spectral
curves obtained this way for these models agree with the ones proposed by
Witten using D-branes and M-theory.
