$U$ of semistable vector bundles on a smooth curve $X$, avoiding geometric
invariant theory. Roughly speaking, Faltings showed that the normalisation $B$
of the ring $A$ of theta functions (associated with vector bundles on $X$)
suffices to realize $U$ as a projective variety. Describing Faltings' work,
C.S. Seshadri asked how close $A$ is to $B$. In this article, we address this
question from a geometric point of view. We consider the rational map, $\pi : U
@>>> Proj(A)$, and show that, not only is $\pi$ defined everywhere, but also
$\pi$ is bijective, and is an isomorphism over the stable locus of $U$, if the
characteristic of the ground field is 0. Moreover, we give a direct local
construction of $U$ as a fine moduli space, when the rank and degree are
coprime, in any characteristic. The methods in the article apply to singular
curves as well.

broad-band colors consistent with the expected spectral energy distribution of

all 8 of these spectroscopic members, we estimate the velocity dispersion is
700 +/- 180 km/s, similar to that of Abell R=1 clusters in the present epoch. A
deep Rosat PSPC observation detects X-ray emission at the 5 sigma level
coincident with the nominal cluster center. Assuming that the X-ray flux is
emitted by hot gas trapped in the potential well of a collapsed system (no AGN
is known to exist in the area), the resulting X-ray luminosity in the rest

line Type IIP (plateau) supernova 1994W. After the plateau phase (t >120 days),
the light curve dropped by 3.5 mag in V in only 12 days. Between 125 and 197
days after explosion the supernova faded substantially faster than the decay
rate of Co-56, and by day 197 it was 3.6 magnitudes less luminous in R compared
to SN 1987A. The low R-luminosity could indicate less than 0.0026 {+0.0017}/
{-0.0011} Msun of Ni-56 ejected at the explosion, but the emission between 125
and 197 days must then have been dominated by an additional power source, pre-
sumably circumstellar interaction. Alternatively, the late light curve was
dominated by Co-56 decay. In this case, the mass of the ejected Ni-56 was 0.015
{+0.012}/{-0.008} Msun, and the rapid fading between 125 and 197 days was most
likely due to dust formation. Though this value of the mass is higher than in
the case with the additional power source, it is still lower than estimated for
any previous Type II supernova. Only progenitors with M(ZAMS) = 8-10 Msun and
M(ZAMS) > 25 Msun are expected to eject such low masses of Ni-56. If M(ZAMS) =
8-10 Msun, the plateau phase indicates a low explosion energy, while for a
progenitor with M(ZAMS) > 25 Msun the energy can be the canonical 1.0E{51}
ergs. As SN 1994W was unusually luminous, the low-mass explosion may require an
uncomfortably high efficiency in converting explosion energy into radiation.
This favors a M(ZAMS) > 25 Msun progenitor. The supernova's narrow (roughly
1000 km s^{-1}) emission lines were excited by the hot supernova spectrum,
rather than a circumstellar shock. The thin shell from which the lines origi-
nated was most likely accelerated by the radiation from the supernova.

show a finite effective mass of the composite fermion by a canonical

the different definition of the effective mass has the different physical
processes. The finite one could be defined for any momentum of the composite

the standard Halperin-Lee-Read model but in the temporal gauge. The advantage

equal to the result that Shankar and Murthy obtained which is well-fit with the
numerical calculation from the ground state energy analysis and a
semi-classical estimation. However, if we consider the random phase
approximation, one sees that the divergence of the effective mass of the
quasiparticle at the Fermi surface emerges again no matter that we work on the

special connection with the nature of the ``fermionic content'' of the mesons

results about CP violation are obtained: ``indirect'' CP violation appears to
results from P violation (unitarity compels the electroweak mass eigenstates to
be C eigenstates), and the role of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix for
fermions fades away: mesonic mass eigenstates can still be CP eigenstates

the valence electrons plays a very important role. For doubly excited states
correlation becomes dominant. Photodetachment is the process where a negative
ion absorbs a photon and as a consquence ejects the outermost electron. A new
detection scheme has been developed. The residual atom of a photodetachment is
state selectively ionised by resonance ionisation spectroscopy. Investigations
of the photodetachment threshold of tellurium with neutral particle detection
yielded an electron affinity of 1589618(5) m^-1. With state selective detection
the Li(2p) photodetachment threshold was investigated and the electron affinity
was determined to be 498490(17) m^-1. Resonance structure in the Li^-
photodetachment cross section near the Li(3p) threshold has been investigated.
According to an assisting calculation this structure is analogous to the
symmetrically excited intrashell (_3{0}_3^+)^1P^o state in H^-. In He^- the

"physics/9709011","Arthur Jaffe","Arthur Jaffe (Harvard University)","Quantum Harmonic Analysis and Geometric Invariants","92 pages, Latex",,,"HUTMP 97/B367","math-ph hep-th math.MP",,"  We develop from scratch a theory of invariants within the framework of
non-commutative geometry. Given an operator Q (a supercharge in physics
language) and an operator a (whose square equals the identity I), we derive a
general formula for an invariant Z(Q,a) depending on Q and a. In case a=I, our
formula reduces to the McKean-Singer representation of the index of Q. The
function Z is invariant in the following sense: if Q=Q(s) depends on a
parameter s, and if Z(Q(s),a) is differentiable in s, then in fact Z(Q(s),a) is
independent of s. We give detailed conditions on Q(s) for which Z(Q(s),a) is
differentiable in s. At the end of this paper, we consider a 2-dimensional
generalization of our theory motivated by space-time supersymmetry. In the case
that expectations are given by functional integrals, Z(Q,a) has a simple
integral representation. We also explain in detail how our construction relates
to Connes' entire cyclic cohomology, as well as to other frameworks.

as an ensemble of pure states in a continuous infinity of ways. An ensemble
which is physically realizable through monitoring the system's environment we
call an `unraveling'. The survival probability S(t) of an unraveling is the
average probability for each of its elements to be unchanged a time t after
cessation of monitoring. The maximally robust unraveling is the one for which
S(t) remains greater than the largest eigenvalue of \rho for the longest time.
The optical parametric oscillator is a soluble example.
