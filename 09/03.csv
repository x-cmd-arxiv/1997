conducted in the 2-10 keV energy band using data from the GIS2 instrument
onboard the ASCA satellite.
  We have selected from the ASCA public archive (as of February 14, 1996) 87
images which are suitable for this project. 60 serendipitous X-ray sources,
with a snr greater than 3.5, were found. The 2-10 keV flux of the detected
sources ranges from 1.1e-13 erg/cm2/s to 4.1e-12 erg/cm2/s. Using this sample
we have extended the description of the 2-10 keV LogN(>S)-LogS to a flux limit
of ~6.3e-14 erg/cm2/s (the faintest detectable flux), i.e. about 2.7 orders of
magnitude fainter than the Piccinotti et al. (1982) determination. The derived
number-flux relationship is well described by a power law model, N(>S) = K
S^{-a}, with best fit values a = 1.67 +- 0.18 and K = 2.85e-21 1/deg2.
  At the flux limit of the survey about 27% of the Cosmic X-ray Background in
the 2-10 keV energy band is resolved in discrete sources. A flattening of the
number-flux relationship, within a factor of 10 from the flux limit of the
present survey, is expected in order to avoid saturation.
  The implications of these results on the models for the origin of the hard
X-ray background are briefly discussed.

distribution; (4) and the bulk velocity from peculiar velocities of galaxies.
We show that measures (1) and (2) are not consistent with each other and either
the power spectrum from peculiar velocities of galaxies is overestimated or the
rms cluster peculiar velocity is underestimated. The amplitude of velocity
fluctuations derived from the galaxy distribution (measure 3) depends on the
parameter $\beta$. We estimate the parameter $\beta$ on the basis of measures
(2) and (4). The power spectrum of velocity fluctuations from the galaxy
distribution in the Stromlo-APM redshift survey is consistent with the observed
rms cluster velocity and with the observed large-scale bulk flow when the
parameter $\beta$ is in the range 0.4-0.5. In this case the value of the
function $V(k)$ at wavelength $\lambda=120h^{-1}$Mpc is $\sim 350$ km s$^{-1}$
and the rms amplitude of the bulk flow at the radius $r=60h^{-1}$ Mpc is $\sim

mode switch for an RR Lyrae variable and it is direct observational evidence
for blueward evolution of horizontal branch stars in the Oosterhoff type I
cluster M3. It also demonstrates that there is a connection between the Blazhko
effect and pulsational mode mixing in RR Lyrae variables. These new
observations also show that the strength of the overtone oscillations in the
RRd star V68 in M3 may have increased in the last 70 years, thus indicating
blueward evolution for V68 as well. A survey of previously published
investigations of RRd stars in Oosterhoff type II systems indicates that there
is marginal evidence for an increase in the strength of fundamental mode
oscillations in two stars: V30 in M15 and AQ Leo. If these increases are
confirmed by future observations, it will indicate redward evolution for RRd

In terms of a matrix potential $g$, we present a gauge field theoretic
formulation of the Maxwell-Bloch equation that provides a semiclassical
description of the propagation of optical pulses through resonant multi-level
media. We show that the Bloch part of the equation can solved identically
through $g$ and the remaining Maxwell equation becomes a second order
differential equation with reduced set of variables due to the gauge invariance
of the system. Our formulation clarifies the (nonabelian) symmetry structure of
the Maxwell-Bloch equations for various multi-level media in association with
symmetric spaces $G/H$. In particular, we associate nondegenerate two-level
system for self-induced transparency with $G/H=SU(2)/U(1)$ and three-level $\L
$- or V-systems with $G/H = SU(3)/U(2)$. We give a detailed analysis for the
two-level case in the matrix potential formalism, and address various new
properties of the system including soliton numbers, effective potential energy,
gauge and discrete symmetries, modified pulse area, conserved topological and
nontopological charges. The nontopological charge measures the amount of
self-detuning of each pulse. Its conservation law leads to a new type of pulse
stability analysis which explains nicely earlier numerical results.

presented in the matrix potential formalism. By applying the B\""{a}cklund
transformation to a constant electric field background, we obtain a general
solution for matched pulses (a pair of solitary waves) which can emit or absorb
a light velocity solitary pulse but otherwise propagate with their shapes
invariant. In the special case, this solution describes a steady state pulse
without emission or absorption, and becomes the matched pulse solution recently
obtained by Hioe and Grobe. A nonlinear superposition rule is derived from the
B\""{a}cklund transformation and used for the explicit construction of two
solitons as well as nonabelian breathers. Various new features of these
solutions are addressed. In particular, we analyze in detail the scattering of
""invertons"", a specific pair of different wavelength solitons one of which
moving with the velocity of light. Unlike the usual case of soliton scattering,
the broader inverton changes its sign through the scattering. Surprisingly, the
light velocity inverton receives time advance through the scattering thereby
moving faster than light, which however does not violate causality.
