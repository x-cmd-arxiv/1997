flat and an open model with Omega_0=0.3, and two models with Omega=1, one with
the standard CDM power spectrum and the other with the same power spectrum as
the Omega_0=0.3 models. The amplitude of primordial fluctuations is set so that
the models reproduce the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters by the
present day. The mass 2-point correlation function and power spectrum of all
the simulations differ significantly from those of the observed galaxy
distribution, in both shape and amplitude. Thus, for any of these models to
provide an acceptable representation of reality, the distribution of galaxies
must be biased relative to the mass in a non-trivial, scale-dependent, fashion.
In the Omega=1 models the required bias is always greater than unity, but in
the Omega_0=0.3 models an ""antibias"" is required on scales smaller than \sim
5\hmpc. The mass correlation functions in the simulations are well fit by
recently published analytic models. The velocity fields are remarkably similar
in all the models, whether they be characterised as bulk flows, 1-particle or
pairwise velocity dispersions. This similarity is a direct consequence of our
adopted normalisation. The small-scale pairwise velocity dispersion of the dark
matter is somewhat larger than recent determinations from galaxy redshift

that, if the scaling between H I mass and B-band luminosity has remained
approximately constant since $z = 1$, the evolution of the luminosity function

$\Omega_{gas}$ by a factor of $\approx 3$ at $z = 0.5 - 1$ . A similar value is
obtained quite independently from consideration of the luminosity function of

damped \lya systems at higher redshift, it is possible to assemble a rough
sketch of the evolution of $\Omega_{gas}$ over the last 90% of the age of the

models of chemical evolution which include the effects of dust, although more
extensive samples of damped \lya systems at low and intermediate redshift are

shown that the equilibrium statistical mechanics requirement that the linear
and angular velocity fields are Gaussian is sufficient to construct the random
thermal forces between dissipative particles. The proposed algorithm is very
similar in structure to the (isothermal) smoothed particle dynamics algorithm.
In this way, this work represents a generalization of smoothed particle
dynamics that incorporates consistently thermal fluctuations and exact angular
momentum conservation. It contains also the dissipative particle dynamics
algorithm as a special case. Finally, the kinetic theory of the dissipative
particles is derived and explicit expressions of the transport coefficients of
the fluid in terms of model parameters are obtained. This allows to discuss
resolution issues for the model.

the integration over the first few massive string states. Very massive string

  Given an elliptic curve E --> B over a base B with zero section i, we denote,
letting E':= E - i(B), by L(E) the Q-vector space with basis ({s}, s \in
E'(B)). Assume that B is smooth and separated over a field of characteristic 0.
On the lowest step, the weak version of the elliptic Zagier conjecture predicts
the existence of a homomorphism \phi from the kernel of a certain differential
d on L(E) to the vector space O*(B) \otimes Q of units on B. This homomorphism
should behave functorially with respect to change of the base B, and it should
satisfy a certain norm compatibility. Also, if B is the spectrum of a local
field, then the absolute value of \phi should be expressible in terms of the
local N\'eron height function. In this paper, we give a proof of this. We also
connect the values of \phi on specific elements of ker(d) to modular, and to
elliptic units.

equation in one dimension in the limit of vanishing viscosity. The initial
velocity is homogeneous and Gaussian with a spectrum proportional to $k^n$ at
small wavenumbers $k$ and falling off quickly at large wavenumbers. In physical
space, at sufficiently large distances, there is an ``outer region'', where the
velocity correlation function preserves exactly its initial form (a power law)
when $n$ is not an even integer. When $1<n<2$ the spectrum, at long times, has
three scaling regions : first, a $|k|^n$ region at very small $k$\ms1 with a
time-independent constant, stemming from this outer region, in which the
initial conditions are essentially frozen; second, a $k^2$ region at
intermediate wavenumbers, related to a self-similarly evolving ``inner region''
in physical space and, finally, the usual $k^{-2}$ region, associated to the
shocks. The switching from the $|k|^n$ to the $k^2$ region occurs around a wave
number $k_s(t) \propto t^{-1/[2(2-n)]}$, while the switching from $k^2$ to
$k^{-2}$ occurs around $k_L(t)\propto t^{-1/2}$ (ignoring logarithmic
corrections in both instances). The key element in the derivation of the
results is an extension of the Kida (1979) log-corrected $1/t$ law for the
energy decay when $n=2$ to the case of arbitrary integer or non-integer $n>1$.
A systematic derivation is given in which both the leading term and estimates
of higher order corrections can be obtained. High-resolution numerical
simulations are presented which support our findings.

  Computer Physics Communications",,"10.1016/S0010-4655(97)00102-1",,"physics.comp-ph astro-ph",,"  N-body algorithms for long-range unscreened interactions like gravity belong
to a class of highly irregular problems whose optimal solution is a challenging
task for present-day massively parallel computers. In this paper we describe a
strategy for optimal memory and work distribution which we have applied to our
parallel implementation of the Barnes & Hut (1986) recursive tree scheme on a
Cray T3D using the CRAFT programming environment. We have performed a series of
tests to find an "" optimal data distribution "" in the T3D memory, and to
identify a strategy for the "" Dynamic Load Balance "" in order to obtain good
performances when running large simulations (more than 10 million particles).
The results of tests show that the step duration depends on two main factors:
the data locality and the T3D network contention. Increasing data locality we
are able to minimize the step duration if the closest bodies (direct
interaction) tend to be located in the same PE local memory (contiguous block
subdivison, high granularity), whereas the tree properties have a fine grain
distribution. In a very large simulation, due to network contention, an
unbalanced load arises. To remedy this we have devised an automatic work
redistribution mechanism which provided a good Dynamic Load Balance at the
price of an insignificant overhead.
