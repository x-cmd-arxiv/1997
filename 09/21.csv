of the close quasar pairs Q1634+267A,B and Q2345+007A,B were in each case
remarkably similar but that individual broad emission lines due to Ly_alpha, Si
IV, C IV, and C III] exhibited differences in profile or equivalent width
between the A and B components. If the A and B components of these objects
result from gravitational lensing of a single QSO, the difference in light
travel time for the two images is roughly 1 year for both pairs. Accordingly,
the authors suggested that observations of the spectra of single QSOs would
reveal similar changes in emission line profiles and equivalent widths on a
time scale of a year or less. In order to test Steidel & Sargent's hypothesis,
we obtained in 1992 high quality spectra of 30 quasars with z(em) ~ 1 selected
from the brighter QSOs in the sample of Steidel & Sargent (1991b), which those
authors had observed in 1989-90. We find that the spectra from the two epochs
are remarkably similar for all QSOs, except for overall changes in fluxes and
minor differences in continuum shape which are probably artifacts introduced by
the observing procedures. However, there are also changes in the equivalent
widths or shapes of the stronger emission lines on rest-frame time scales of
1-1.5 years in about two thirds of the QSOs. These observations, therefore,
support the notion that the spectra of the components in lensed QSOs need not
be exactly identical. Moreover, it should be expected that any differences
between the components in such systems should change with time.

Interferometry allows us to obtain power spectra of fluctuating beads from 0.1
Hz to 20 kHz, and with sub-nanometer spatial resolution. Using linear response
theory, we determined the frequency-dependent loss and storage shear moduli up
to frequencies on the order of a kHz. Our technique measures local values of
the viscoelastic response, without actively straining the system, and is
especially suited to soft biopolymer networks. We studied semiflexible F-actin
solutions and, as a control, flexible polyacrylamide (PAAm) gels, the latter
close to their gelation threshold. With small particles, we could probe the
transition from macroscopic viscoelasticity to more complex microscopic
dynamics. In the macroscopic limit we find shear moduli at 0.1 Hz of G'=0.11
+/- 0.03 Pa and 0.17 +/- 0.07 Pa for 1 and 2 mg/ml actin solutions, close to
the onset of the elastic plateau, and scaling behavior consistent with G(omega)
as omega^(3/4) at higher frequencies. For polyacrylamide we measured plateau
moduli of 2.0, 24, 100 and 280 Pa for crosslinked gels of 2, 2.5, 3 and 5%
concentration (weight/volume) respectively, in agreement to within a factor of
two with values obtained from conventional rheology. We also found evidence for
scaling of G(omega) as \omega^(1/2), consistent with the predictions of the

relate the stress tensor to the state of outwards signals coming from the

excludes the contribution of the anomalous trace close to the black hole

equilibrium-temperature of the cosmological horizon in a leading order

asymptotics expansions (transseries) and show that the extension provides a
method of finding singularities of solutions of nonlinear differential
equations, using asymptotic information. This transasymptotic matching method
is applied to Painlev\'e's first equation. The solutions of P1 that are bounded
in some direction towards infinity can be expressed as series of functions,
obtained by generalized Borel summation of formal transseries solutions; the
series converge in a neighborhood of infinity. We prove (under certain
restrictions) that the boundary of the region of convergence contains actual
poles of the associated solution. As a consequence, the position of these
exterior poles is derived from asymptotic data. In particular, we prove that
the location of the outermost pole $x_p(C)$ on $\RR^+$ of a solution is
monotonic in a parameter $C$ describing its asymptotics on antistokes
lines$^1$, and obtain rigorous bounds for $x_p(C)$. We also derive the behavior
of $x_p(C)$ for large $C\in\CC$. The appendix gives a detailed classical proof

superficially similar to the Abraham-Lorentz and Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equations
of motion, these conditions differ from them in several fundamental ways. They
are not equations of motion in the usual sense but rather a set of conditions
which these motions must obey in the asymptotic future of an initial value
surface. In addition to being asymptotic, these conditions of motion are
approximate and apply, as do the original EIH equations, only to slowly moving
systems. Also, they do not admit the run- away solutions of these other
equations. As in the original EIH work, they are integrability conditions
gotten from integrating the empty-space (i.e., source free) Einstein-Maxwell
