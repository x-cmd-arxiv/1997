of lensed QSOs declines with QSO redshift more precipitously than expected in

isothermal spheres or point masses. In this Letter I propose that the observed
trend arises naturally if the lensing galaxies have logarithmic surface mass
density profiles that gradually change with radius. If the observed lack of
central (odd) images is also taken into account, the data favor a universal
dark matter density profile over an isothermal sphere with a core. Since the
trend of image separation vs. source redshift is mostly a reflection of galaxy
properties, it cannot be straightforwardly used as a test of cosmological
models. Furthermore, the current upper limits on the cosmological constant may
have to be revised.

  Galaxies","The paper has been expanded (by about 10%) to provide a more detailed
  discussion of the physics described. None of the results/conclusions changed",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Some recent work has shown that the spectrum of Seyfert 1 Galaxies is very
similar to that of several Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHCs) in their hard
state. However, the smallness of the observed reflection component in Cygnus
X-1, in addition to other constraints, seem to rule out the two-phase model
(otherwise successful in the case of Seyfert Galaxies) for GBHCs. Here, we show
that the latter conclusion is based on a number of key assumptions that
probably are not valid when the overlying corona is patchy, e.g., when it is
comprised of localized magnetic flares above the disk. We show that in GBHCs
the energy deposited by the X-rays cannot be re-radiated fast enough to
maintain equilibrium, unless the X-ray skin heats up to the Compton
temperature, at which point the gas is mostly ionized. This leads to a
substantially reduced cooling rate for the active regions due to the
correspondingly smaller number of re-injected low-energy photons. We model this
effect by introducing a transition layer situated between the corona and the
cold disk, and find that the resulting spectrum is harder than that obtained
with the standard (and unrealistic) two-phase model. We apply this model to
Cygnus X-1 and show that it can account for its observed spectrum. This
analysis therefore seems to provide a consistentpicture for both Seyfert
Galaxies and GBHCs within the same framework, with differences arising due to
the changing physical conditionsin the two categories of sources, rather than
due to an ad hoc variation of the model parameters.

single layer at filling \nu_1 forms a ferromagnetic, fully spin-polarized,
gapped incompressible quantum Hall state. For the case \nu_1 = 1, a detailed
Hartree-Fock analysis is carried out on a realistic, microscopic Hamiltonian.
Apart from the state continuously connected to the ground state of two well
separated layers, we find two double-layer quantum Hall phases: one with a
finite interlayer antiferromagnetic spin ordering in the plane orthogonal to
the applied field (the `canted' state), and the other a spin singlet. The
quantum transitions between the various quantum Hall states are continuous, and
are signaled by the softening of collective intersubband spin density
excitations. For the case of general \nu_1, closely related results are
obtained by a semi-phenomenological continuum quantum field theory description
of the low-lying spin excitations using a non-linear sigma model. Because of
its broken symmetry, the canted phase supports a linearly dispersing Goldstone
mode and has a finite temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We present
results on the form of the phase diagram, the magnitude of the canted order
parameter, the collective excitation dispersions, the specific heat, the form
of the dynamic light scattering spectrum at finite temperature, and the
Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature. Our findings are consistent with

Kogut-Susskind action. A simple continuum extrapolation quadratic in $a$ leads
to $B_K$(NDR, 2 GeV) = 0.598(5). As our final value of $B_K$ in the continuum
we present $B_K$(NDR, 2 GeV)=0.628(42), as obtained by a fit including an

on singular curves, where times are the moduli of curves. It has a form of
reduced non-autonomous hamiltonian systems which include as particular examples
the Schlesinger equations, Painlev\'{e} VI equation and their generalizations.
In general case, they are defined as hierarchies of isomonodromic deformations
(HID) with respect to changing the moduli of underling curves. HID are
accompanying with the Whitham hierarchies. The phase space of HID is the space
of flat connections of $G$ bundles with some additional data in the marked
points. HID can be derived from some free field theory by the hamiltonian
reduction under the action of the gauge symmetries and subsequent factorization
with respect to diffeomorphisms of curve. This approach allows to define the
Lax equations associated with HID and the linear system whose isomonodromic
deformations are provided by HID. In addition, it leads to description of
solutions of HID by the projection method.
  In some special limit HID convert into the Hitchin systems. In particular,
for $\SL$ bundles over elliptic curves with a marked point we obtain in this
limit the elliptic Calogero $N$-body system

theory treatments of the NN interaction are to yield finite answers. We discuss
various regularization schemes used in the literature. Two of these methods
involve formally iterating the divergent interaction and then regularizing and
renormalizing the resultant amplitude. Either a (sharp or smooth) cutoff can be
introduced, or dimensional regularization can be applied. We show that these
two methods yield different results after renormalization. Furthermore, if a
cutoff is used, the NN phase shift data cannot be reproduced if the cutoff is
taken to infinity. We also argue that the assumptions which allow the use of
dimensional regularization in perturbative EFT calculations are violated in
this problem. Another possibility is to introduce a regulator into the
potential before iteration and then keep the cutoff parameter finite. We argue
that this does not lead to a systematically-improvable NN interaction.
