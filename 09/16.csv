visible at optical wavelengths, and therefore, do not fall into the `standard'
Herbig-Haro object classification scheme. Nevertheless, they belong to an ever
growing group of molecular hydrogen jets associated with YSOs which are
optically undetected. The jets are very well collimated, with a length-to-width
ratio of 10-20. The spectra of the jet and counter-jet in the K-band show a
limited number of molecular hydrogen emission lines which makes it difficult to
obtain an accurate excitation temperature. We estimate Tex = 1104+/-67 K and
Tex = 920+/- 156 K for the red and blue jet components respectively. The radial
velocities of the jet and counter-jet, based on the shift of the (1,0) S(1)
2.121 micron line, are -275+/- 50 km/s and 180+/- 50 km/s respectively,
suggesting an angle of 30 to 45 degrees between the jet and the line of sight.
The molecular hydrogen emission of the entire jet extends for at least 40"" or
0.1 pc at the distance of Orion. If the flow velocity is comparable to that of
the radial velocities, then the dynamical age of the system is quite short
(about 500 yrs), consistent with a young jet arising from an embedded source.
Entrainment in a turbulent mixing layer may explain this morphology and
spectral character.

  P. Madau, STScI Symposium Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I review a technique for interpreting faint galaxy data which traces the
evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density, as determined from
several deep spectroscopic samples and the HDF. The method relies on the rest
frame UV and near-IR continua of galaxies as indicators, for a given IMF and
dust content, of their instantaneous SFR and total stellar mass, and offers the
prospect of addressing in a coherent framework an important set of subjects:
cosmic star formation history, dust in primeval galaxies, shape of the IMF,
stellar mass-to-light ratios of present-day galaxies, extragalactic background
light, Type II supernovae and heavy element enrichment history of the universe.
The global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies are well fit by a
simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent SFR per unit
comoving volume, a universal IMF which is relatively rich in massive stars, and
a modest amount of dust reddening. The model is able to account for the entire
background light recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude
levels probed by the HDF, and produces visible mass-to-light ratios at the
present epoch which are consistent with the values observed in nearby galaxies
of various morphological types. The bulk (>60%) of the stars present today
formed relatively recently (z<1.5), consistently with the expectations from a
broad class of hierarchical clustering cosmologies, and in good agreement with
the low level of metal enrichment observed at high redshifts in the damped
Lyman-alpha systems. Throughout this review I emphasize how the poorly
constrained amount of starlight that was absorbed by dust and reradiated in the
far-IR at early epochs represents one of the biggest uncertainties in our
understanding of the evolution of luminous matter in the universe.

supernova has been performed by means of two dimensional hydrodynamical
calculations. We have compared the results with the observations of SN 1987A.
Our chief findings are as follows: (1) $^{44}Ti$ is synthesized so much as to
explain the tail of the bolometric light curve of SN 1987A. We think this is
because the alpha-rich freezeout takes place more actively under the
axisymmetric explosion. (2) $^{57}Ni$ and $^{58}Ni$ tend to be overproduced
compared with the observations. However, this tendency relies strongly on the
progenitor's model.
  We have also compared the abundance of each element in the mass number range
$A= 16-73$ with the solar values. We have found three outstanding features. (1)
For the nuclei in the range $A=16-40$, their abundances are insensitive to the
initial form of the shock wave. This insensitivity is favored since the
spherical calculations thus far can explain the solar system abundances in this
mass range. (2) There is an enhancement around A=45 in the axisymmetric
explosion compared with the spherical explosion fairly well. In particular,
$^{44}Ca$, which is underproduced in the present spherical calculations, is
enhanced significantly. (3) In addition, there is an enhancement around A=65.
This tendency does not rely on the form of the mass cut but of the initial
shock wave. This enhancement may be the problem of the overproduction in this
mass range, although this effect would be relatively small since Type I
supernovae are chiefly responsible for this mass number range.

expand an Euclidean wave function around an instanton, by using a deviation
equation of a vector field tangent to a congruence of instantons. The instanton
around which we expand the wave function corresponds to a so-called most
probable escape path (MPEP). It is shown that, when the wave function is
analytically continued, the corresponding state of physical perturbations is
equivalent to the vacuum state determined by positive-frequency mode functions
which satisfy appropriate boundary conditions. Thus a quantum field theory is
effective to investigate a state after a quantum tunneling with gravity. The
effective Lagrangian describing the field theory is obtained by simply reducing
the original Lagrangian to a subspace spanned by the physical perturbations.

(2+1) dimensions undergo an effective change of statistics, i.e., become
anyons. We will consider several generalizations thereof, arising when the
gauge field is more general. The first one is ``multispecies anyons''---charged
particles of several species coupled to one, or possibly several, Chern-Simons
fields. The second one is finite-size anyons, which are charged particles
coupled to a gauge field described by the Chern-Simons term plus some other
term. In fact, rigorously speaking, quasielectrons and quasiholes in the
fractional quantum Hall effect are multispecies finite-size anyons. The third
one is an analog of finite-size anyons which arises in a model with a mixed
Chern-Simons term; notably, this model is P,T-invariant, which opens the way
for practical applications even when there is no parity-breaking magnetic
field.

result is not equivalent to the usual non-linear realization of supersymmetry,
where a pair of goldstinos couples to the energy-momentum tensor of the matter

a second independent invariant coupling, and we show that there are no other

expansion. We conclude by commenting on the interpretation of our results and

interpretation less than half of the votes. The Many Worlds interpretation
(MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the Consistent Histories and Bohm
interpretations. It is argued that since all the above-mentioned approaches to
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics give identical cookbook prescriptions for how
to calculate things in practice, practical-minded experimentalists, who have
traditionally adopted the ``shut-up-and-calculate interpretation'', typically
show little interest in whether cozy classical concepts are in fact real in
some untestable metaphysical sense or merely the way we subjectively perceive a
mathematically simpler world where the Schrodinger equation describes
everything - and that they are therefore becoming less bothered by a profusion
of worlds than by a profusion of words.
  Common objections to the MWI are discussed. It is argued that when
environment-induced decoherence is taken into account, the experimental
predictions of the MWI are identical to those of the Copenhagen interpretation
except for an experiment involving a Byzantine form of ``quantum suicide''.
This makes the choice between them purely a matter of taste, roughly equivalent
to whether one believes mathematical language or human language to be more
fundamental.
