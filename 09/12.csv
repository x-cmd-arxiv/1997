perpendicular to the radio jets. We estimate the timescale that the gas disk
should precess in the galaxy. Since this timescale is short ($\sim 2\times
10^7$ years at 100 pc) we consider mechanisms that could cause the gas disk to
be misaligned with the galaxy. One possibility is that a cooling flow
replenishes the disk on this timescale and at angles that vary with radius.
Another possibility is that there is a pressure on the disk that is large
enough to overcome the torque from the galaxy. We estimate this pressure and
find that it can be provided by ram pressure from an energetic interstellar
medium that is consistent with velocity dispersions observed in ionized gas and
densities estimated from the X-ray emission. We therefore propose that an AGN
associated energetic interstellar medium is responsible for causing the gas
disk in M84 to be misaligned with the galaxy isophotal major axis for $r \lta
600$ pc. We propose that AGN associated outflows or kinetic motion in low
density media could be responsible for jet/disk alignments observed on 100 pc
scales in nearby radio galaxies.

  Ostriker (Princeton University Observatory)","On the Clustering of Lyman Alpha Clouds","submitted to ApJ on 7/17/97, 26 latex pages and 8 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We examine the correlational property of $\lya$ clouds in detail and compare
it to that of mass and galaxies. We show that the correlation strength of
$\lya$ clouds is somewhat weaker than that of the underlying matter, which in
turn is weaker than that of galaxies (biased galaxy formation). On the scales
probed, $10-300$km/s, for $\lya$ clouds, we find that higher density, higher
optical depth, higher column density regions are more strongly clustered than
lower density, lower optical depth, lower column density regions. Thus, a
consistent picture seems to emerge: the correlation strength for a given set of
objects is positively correlated with their characteristic global density and
the differences among the correlations of galaxies, $\lya$ clouds and mass
reflect the differences in density that each trace. Significant positive
correlations with a strength of $0.1-1.0$ are found for $\lya$ clouds in the
velocity range $50-300$km/s. Among the correlational measures examined, an
optical depth correlation function (Equation 5) proposed here may serve as the
best correlational measure. It reasonably faithfully represents the true
correlation of the underlying matter, enabling a better indication of both
matter correlation and the relationship between galaxies and $\lya$ clouds.
Furthermore, it appears to be an alternative to the conventional line-line
correlation function with the virtue that it does not require ambiguous
post-observation fitting procedures such as those commonly employed in the
conventional line-finding methods. Neither does it depend sensitively on the
observational resolution (e.g., FWHM), insofaras the clouds are resolved
Conveniently, it can be easily measured with the current observational
sensitivity without being contaminated significantly by the presence of noise.

bursts (GRBs) and their apparent peak brightness. The strongest effect (with a
significance level of 10^{-6}) is the difference between the brightness
distributions of simple bursts (dominated by a single smooth pulse) and complex
bursts (consisting of overlapping pulses). The latter has a break at a peak
flux of 1.5 ph/cm^2/s, while the distribution of simple bursts is smooth down
to the BATSE threshold. We also observe brightness dependent variations in the

the rising slope hardly changes. Both slopes of the ATP are deformed for weak

simple: a complex burst where a number of independent pulses overlap in time
appears intrinsically stronger than a simple burst. Then the BATSE sample of

the peak in the star formation rate that was recently shown to occur at a

of time, when a BL Lac object is variable) in x-ray selected BL Lac objects is
0.4 or less. The typical peak-to-peak amplitudes of the variability are 10%.
Typical time-scales and an activity parameter for our variable BL Lac objects

only 4 BL Lac objects we were able to measure a characteristic time-scale,
which was in the range between 1.3 and 2.7 days. Comparison with our previous

linking x-ray selected and radio-selected BL Lac objects have been compared to
our observations. Consistency is found for a scenario, where x-ray selected BL

phenomenologically by naming their LSP -- that is, once the LSP is
approximately fixed so is the behavior of the observables, and the resulting
behavior is generally very different for different LSPs. Next I compare the
three main LSP-models (gravitino, bino, higgsino). Hints from data suggest
taking the higgsino-LSP world very seriously, so I focus on it, and describe
its successful prediction of reported events from the 1996 LEP runs. SUSY
signatures in the $\tilde h$ LSP world are very different from those that are

additional contribution to the energy density scaling as 1/a^6, which dominates
until just before nucleosynthesis, the observed baryon asymmetry may be
produced at the electroweak scale in simple extensions of the Minimal Standard
Model, even in the case that the phase transition is not first order. We focus
our attention on one such cosmology, in which the Universe goes through a
period termed `kination' in which its energy is dominated by the kinetic energy
of a scalar field. The required kinetic energy dominated modes can occur either
as a field rolls down an exponential (or steeper) potential, or in the
oscillation of a field about the minimum of a steep power-law potential. We
implement in detail the former case with a single exponential field first
driving inflation, and then rolling into a kinetic energy dominated mode.
Reheating is achieved using an alternative to the usual mechanism due to
Spokoiny, in which the Universe is `reheated' by particle creation in the
expanding background. Density perturbations of the magnitude required for
structure formation may also be generated. We show that the analogous model for
the power-law potential cannot be consistently implemented. In models with
inflation driven by a second field and the usual mechanism of reheating (by
decay of the inflaton) the required kinetic energy dominated cosmology is
viable in both types of potential.

being completed. Sources of systematic error, both within the quenched
approximation and from quenching itself, are estimated, although the latter
estimate is rather crude. A sample of our results is: $f_B=153 \pm 10
{}^{+36}_{-13} {}^{+13}_{-0} MeV$, $f_{B_s}/f_B = 1.10 \pm 0.02

systematic (within the quenched approximation), and systematic (of quenching),
respectively. The largest source of error comes from the extrapolation to the
continuum. The second largest source is the chiral extrapolation. At present,
the central values are based on linear chiral extrapolations; a shift to
quadratic extrapolations would for example raise $f_B$ by $\approx 20$ MeV and
thereby make the error within the quenched approximation more symmetric.

vacuum unstable. In this talk a brief review of this issue is performed. When a
complete analysis of all the potentially dangerous directions in the field
space of the theory is carried out, imposing that the standard vacuum should be
the global minimum, the corresponding constraints turn out to be very strong
and, in fact, there are extensive regions in the parameter space of soft
SUSY--breaking terms that become forbidden. For instance, in the context of the
MSSM with universal soft terms, this produces important bounds, not only on the
value of A, but also on the values of B, M and m. In specific SUSY scenarios,
as fixed point models, no-scale supergravity, gauge-mediated SUSY breaking and
superstrings, the charge and color breaking constraints are also very
important. For example, if the dilaton is the source of SUSY breaking in
four-dimensional superstrings, the whole parameter space (m_{3/2},B) is
excluded on these grounds. Cosmological analyses are also briefly reviewed.

amplitude for the two-photon emission strongly correlated to the $b\to s\gamma$
amplitude which is sharply constrained by experiment. A quite general statement
follows: as long as non-standard physics effects appear only in the matching of
the Wilson coefficients of the standard effective operator basis, the
deviations from the standard model expectations of the decay rates induced by
$b\to s\gamma\gamma$ are bound to follow closely the corresponding deviations
on $b\to s\gamma$. Effects of new physics are therefore bound to be small.

angle of theta_pq=11 degrees, covering a range in missing energy of E_m = 0 to
65 MeV. The R_LT structure function is found to be consistent with zero for E_m
> 50 MeV, confirming an earlier study which indicated that R_L vanishes in this
region. The integrated strengths of the p- and s-shell are compared with a
Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation calculation. The s-shell strength and

The DWIA calculation overestimates the cross sections for p- and s-shell proton
knockout as expected, but surprisingly agrees with the extracted R_LT value for
both shells. The HF-RPA calculation describes the data more consistently, which
may be due to the inclusion of 2-body currents in this calculation.
