nuclei, the emission-line spectrum of NGC 6500 is remarkable for its
low-excitation character: C III], C II], and Mg II are the strongest
collisionally excited lines in the UV, and C IV is not detected. The fast shock
models of Dopita & Sutherland (1995, 1996) are a poor match to the observed
spectrum, as they predict much stronger emission than is observed for
high-excitation lines such as C IV. Photoionization by an obscured nonstellar
continuum source, or possibly ionization by slower (100 km/s) shocks, are more
likely explanations for the emission-line ratios. The origin of the UV
continuum is unclear; its overall spectral shape is reasonably well matched by
spectral evolution models for single-burst populations with ages in the range
70-100 Myr, but no definite absorption features from young stars are present.
Alternately, the UV continuum (or some fraction of it) may be scattered
radiation from a hidden active nucleus. We tentatively detect a broad He II
4686 emission feature, which may be due to Wolf-Rayet stars, although the UV

transport of energy and momentum by the radio-emitting jets and consequently
that the ratio of the radio power to jet energy flux is much smaller than is
usually assumed for radio galaxies. This can be partially attributed to the
smaller ages ($\sim 10^6 yrs$) of Seyferts compared to radio galaxies but one
also requires that either the magnetic energy density is more than an order of
magnitude below the equipartition value, or more likely, that the internal
energy densities of Seyfert jets are dominated by thermal plasma. If Seyfert
jets are initially dominated by relativistic plasma, then an analysis of the
data on jets in five Seyfert galaxies shows that all but one of these would
have mildly relativistic jet velocities near 100 pc in order to power the
respective narrow-line regions. However, observations of jet-cloud interactions
in the NLR provide additional information on jet velocities and composition via
the momentum budget. Our analysis of a jet-cloud interaction in NGC 1068,
implies a shocked jet pressure much larger than the minimum pressure of the
radio knot, a velocity $\sim 0.06 c$ and a jet temperature $\sim 10^9 K$
implying mildly relativistic electrons but thermal protons. The jet mass flux
at this point $\sim 0.5 M_\odot yr^{-1}$, is an order of magnitude higher than
the mass accretion rate into the black hole, strongly indicating entrainment.
The initial jet mass flux $\sim 0.02 M_\odot yr^{-1}$, comparable to the mass
accretion rate and is consistent with the densities inferred for accretion disc
coronae from high energy observations, together with an initially mildly
relativistic velocity and an initial jet radius of order 10 gravitational

decompose the Lyman alpha and the C IV (1549 A) emission-lines of each object
into two components with uncorrelated variations. We find that the principal
component describes correlated continuum and line variations, whereas the rest
component reveals the line-parts that do not vary in tune with the continuum. A
cross-correlation analysis in NGC 5548 reveals that variable line features in
the rest component follow the continuum by about 25 days. The symmetry usually
observed in the component's line profiles excludes that the velocity field of
the line-emitting region is dominated by radial motion. In some objects, the
principal component reveals a clearly double-peaked line profile.
  The results suggest that the variable line feature in the principal and the
rest component is respectively emitted in the inner and outer parts of an
extended broad-line region (BLR). The fraction of the line that varies together
with the continuum seems to decrease significantly with increasing luminosity.
We interpret this trend as a consequence of a larger BLR in more luminous
objects. Finally, we propose a solution to the C IV/Ly_a ratio problem without
referring to optically thin emission-line clouds.

out to be the Lagrangian fixed point solutions of the equivalent
$(\alpha,{\boldmath$\chi$})$ equations with a corresponding angle $\phi = 0$.
Under certain assumptions for more general flows it is shown that there is an
attracting fixed point of the $(\alpha,\bchi)$ equations which corresponds to
positive vortex stretching and for which the cosine of the corresponding angle
is close to unity. This indicates that near alignment is an attracting state of
the system and is consistent with the formation of Burgers-like structures.

ferromagnetic phase, (ii) phase separation between hole-poor antiferromagnetic

timelike direction, a new definition of asymptotic flatness at timelike
infinity for an isolated system with a source is proposed. The treatment
provides unit spacelike 3-hyperboloid timelike infinity and avoids the
introduction of the troublesome differentiability conditions which were
necessary in the previous works on asymptotically flat spacetimes at timelike
infinity. Asymptotic flatness is characterized by the fall-off rate of the
energy-momentum tensor at timelike infinity, which makes it easier to
understand physically what spacetimes are investigated. The notion of the order
of the asymptotic flatness is naturally introduced from the rate. The
definition gives a systematized picture of hierarchy in the asymptotic
structure, which was not clear in the previous works. It is found that if the
energy-momentum tensor falls off at a rate faster than $\sim t^{-2}$, the
spacetime is asymptotically flat and asymptotically stationary in the sense
that the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to $\ppp_t$ falls off at the
rate $\sim t^{-2}$. It also admits an asymptotic symmetry group similar to the
Poincar\'e group. If the energy-momentum tensor falls off at a rate faster than
$\sim t^{-3}$, the four-momentum of a spacetime may be defined. On the other
hand, angular momentum is defined only for spacetimes in which the
energy-momentum tensor falls off at a rate faster than $\sim t^{-4}$.

unified manner. This includes also general dilaton theories and especially
spherically symmetric gravity (SSG) and Witten's dilatonic black hole (DBH). A
common feature --- also in the presence of matter fields of any type --- is the
appearance of an absolutely conserved quantity C which is determined by the
influx of matter. Only for a subclass of generalized dilaton theories the
singularity structure vanishes together with C. Such `physical' theories
include, of course, SSG and DBH. It seems to have been overlooked until
recently that the (classical) 'black hole' singularity of the DBH deviates from
SSG in a physically nontrivial manner. At the quantum level for all generalized
dilaton theories --- in the absence of matter --- the local quantum effects are
shown to disappear. This enables us to compute e.g. the second loop order
correction to the Polyakov term. For non-minimal scalar coupling we also
believe to have settled the controversial issue of Hawking radiation to
infinity with a somewhat puzzling result for the case of SSG.

gravitational waves (gravitons) will depend upon their frequency and the

inspiralling compact binaries, gravitational waves emitted at low frequency
early in the inspiral will travel slightly slower than those emitted at high
frequency later, modifying the phase evolution of the observed inspiral
gravitational waveform, similar to that caused by post-Newtonian corrections to
quadrupole phasing. Matched filtering of the waveforms can bound such
frequency-dependent variations in propagation speed, and thereby bound the
graviton mass. The bound depends on the mass of the source and on noise
characteristics of the detector, but is independent of the distance to the
source, except for weak cosmological redshift effects. For observations of
stellar-mass compact inspiral using ground-based interferometers of the
LIGO/VIRGO type, the bound on the graviton Compton wavelength is of the order
of $6 \times 10^{12}$ km, about double that from solar-system tests of Yukawa
modifications of Newtonian gravity. For observations of super-massive black

growth of the scale factor. We find that a very specific combination of these
large fluctuations plus the inflaton zero mode assemble into a new effective
field. This new field behaves classically and it is the object which actually
rolls down. We show how this reinterpretation saves the standard picture of how
metric perturbations are generated during inflation and that the spinodal
growth of fluctuations dominates the time dependence of the Bardeen variable
for superhorizon modes during inflation. We compute the amplitude and index for
the spectrum of scalar density and tensor perturbations and argue that in all
models of this type the spinodal instabilities are responsible for a `red'
spectrum of primordial scalar density perturbations. A criterion for the
validity of these models is provided and contact with the reconstruction

  Theory"", Zakopane, 1997",,,,"hep-th",,"  In these two lectures given at the 1997 Zakopane workshop on ""New
Developments in Quantum Field Theory"" we review recent results on universal
fluctuations in QCD Dirac spectra. We start the first lecture with a review of
some general properties of Dirac spectra. It will be argued that there is an
intimate relation between chiral symmetry breaking and correlations of Dirac
eigenvalues. In particular, we will focus on the microscopic spectral density
density, i.e. the spectral density near zero virtuality on the scale of a
typical level spacing. The relation with Leutwyler-Smilga sum-rules will be
discussed. Standard methods for the statistical analysis of quantum spectra
will be reviewed. Recent results on the application of Random Matrix Theory to
spectra of 'complex' systems will be summarized. This leads to the introduction
of a chiral Random Matrix Theory (chRMT) with the global symmetries of the QCD
partition function. In the second lecture the chiral random matrix model will
be compared to QCD and some of its properties will be discussed. Our central
conjecture is that correlations of QCD Dirac spectra are described by chRMT. We
will review recent results showing that the microscopic spectral density and
eigenvalue correlations near zero virtuality are strongly universal. Lattice
QCD results for the microscopic spectral density and for correlations in the
bulk of the spectrum will be presented. In all cases that have been considered,
the correlations are in perfect agreement with chRMT. We will end the second
lecture with a review of chiral Random Matrix Theory at nonzero chemical
potential. New features of spectral universality in nonhermitean matrices will
be discussed.

systems. In this framework, the decay of an unstable system is described by a
semigroup. The spectrum of the generator of the semigroup corresponds to the
singularities of the Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix. In the case of discrete (complex)
spectrum of the generator of the semigroup, associated with resonances, the
decay law is exactly exponential. The states corresponding to these resonances
(eigenfunctions of the generator of the semigroup) lie in the Lax-Phillips
Hilbert space, and therefore all physical properties of the resonant states can
be computed.
  We show that the Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix is unitarily related to the
$S$-matrix of standard scattering theory by a unitary transformation
parametrized by the spectral variable $\sigma$ of the Lax-Phillips theory.
Analytic continuation in $\sigma$ has some of the properties of a method
developed some time ago for application to dilation analytic potentials.
  We work out an illustrative example using a Lee-Friedrichs model for the
underlying dynamical system.

perturbations (NEPs) (which are potentially dangerous because they can lead to
either linear or nonlinear explosive instabilities) in cylindrical equilibria
of magnetically confined plasmas is investigated within the framework of
Maxwell-drift kinetic theory. It turns out that for wave vectors with a
non-vanishing component parallel to the magnetic field the conditions for the
existence of NEPs in equilibria with E=0 [G. N. Throumoulopoulos and D.
Pfirsch, Phys. Rev. E 53, 2767 (1996)] remain valid, while the condition for
the existence of perpendicular NEPs, which are found to be the most important
perturbations, is modified. For $|e_i\phi|\approx T_i$ ($\phi$ is the
electrostatic potential) and $T_i/T_e > \beta_c\approx P/(B^2/8\pi)$ ($P$ is
the total plasma pressure), a case which is of operational interest in magnetic
confinement systems, the existence of perpendicular NEPs depends on $e_\nu E$,
where $e_\nu$ is the charge of the particle species $\nu$. In this case the
electric field can reduce the NEPs activity in the edge region of tokamaklike
and stellaratorlike equilibria with identical parabolic pressure profiles, the
reduction of electron NEPs being more pronounced than that of ion NEPs.

the eigenenergies exhibit strong level repulsions when the angle between the
fields is varied. The large avoided crossings occur between states with the
same approximately conserved principal quantum number, n, and this
intramanifold mixing of states cannot be explained, not even qualitatively, by
conventional perturbation theory. However, it is well reproduced by an extended
perturbation theory which takes into account all couplings between the angular
momentum and Runge-Lenz vector. The large avoided crossings are interpreted as
a quantum manifestation of classical intramanifold chaos. This interpretation
is supported by both classical Poincar\'e surfaces of section, which reveal a
mixed regular-chaotic intramanifold dynamics, and the statistical analysis of
nearest-neighbor-spacing
