in the region, 175 of them new. 414 galaxies are in the supercluster, about
three times the number used in the previous supercluster study. We verify the
existence of the three individual clusters and compute their individual
dynamical parameters. We investigate several techniques for assigning galaxy
membership to clusters in this crowded field. We use the KMM mixture-modeling
algorithm to separate the galaxies into clusters; we find that A2152 has a
higher mean velocity than previous studies have reported. A2147 and A2152 also
have lower velocity dispersions: 821(+68)(-55) and 715(+81)(-61) km/s. The
assignment of galaxies to either A2152 or A2147 requires velocity and position

results indicate that it is difficult to match absorbers with particular

is dominated by low luminosity dwarfs. A large fraction of absorption lines is
found to originate from low surface brightness galaxies, so that the absorbing
galaxy is likely to be misidentified. Low redshift Lyman alpha absorber counts
can easily be explained by moderately extended galaxy disks when low surface

HII regions. The proximity of the C II] lambda2326 multiplet to the [O II]

the carbon abundance in high-redshift objects. Derived chemical properties are
consistent with a significant correlation between N and C abundances in
metal-poor extragalactic HII regions. This result is unexpected if the
dispersion in N/O among galaxies of similar metallicity is caused by localized,
temporary chemical enrichments from massive stars. The presence of a
correlation suggests that the majority of N and C production is coupled, as
expected from chemical evolution models where C is produced predominantly by
low mass stars and N is produced predominantly by intermediate mass stars.
Since the occurance of localized chemical ""pollution"" in star-forming galaxies
appears to be low, the relative overabundance of N in some galaxies compared to
others at similar metallicity is most plausibly interpreted as an indicator of
the global, secular chemical enrichment history. The N/O and perhaps the C/O

not have the same properties as those in the circumstellar envelopes of field
Miras. R Aqr's 22-/321-GHz peak flux density and luminosity ratios are low, as
is the line-width ratio. Continuum and spectral-line maps indicate that the
22-GHz maser and free-free emission are aligned. Three mechanisms can reproduce
the data with varying degrees of success. All three lead naturally to normal
levels of maser emission in SiO and 321-GHz H2O and anomalously weak OH and
22-GHz H2O masers. In the most convincing model, UV radiation and a fast wind
from the companion remove the Mira's envelope of dusty, molecular gas, leaving
a relatively small cavity of dense, neutral material within a large, ionized
nebula. Excitation temperatures suggest that 321-GHz masers are normally
excited close to the Mira whilst 22-GHz masers are more remote; in R Aqr,
therefore, the 22-GHz masers do not form under optimum conditions. Instead, we
see weak and narrow lines that form closer to the Mira, consistent with our

describe our Universe reasonably well. However, Einstein's equations allow a
much larger class of cosmological solutions. Theorems originally due to Penrose
and Hawking predict that all such models (assuming reasonable matter
properties) will have an initial singularity. The nature of this singularity in
generic cosmologies remains a major open question in general relativity.
Spatially homogeneous but possibly anisotropic cosmologies have two types of
singularities: (1) velocity dominated---(reversing the time direction) the
universe evolves to the singularity with fixed anisotropic collapse rates ; (2)
Mixmaster---the anisotropic collapse rates change in a deterministically
chaotic way. Much less is known about spatially inhomogeneous universes.
Belinskii, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz (BKL) claimed long ago that a generic
universe would evolve toward the singularity as a different Mixmaster universe
at each spatial point. We shall report on the results of a program to test the
BKL conjecture numerically. Results include a new algorithm to evolve
homogeneous Mixmaster models, demonstration of velocity dominance and
understanding of evolution toward velocity dominance in the plane symmetric
Gowdy universes (spatial dependence in one direction), demonstration of
velocity dominance in polarized U(1) symmetric cosmologies (spatial dependence
in two directions), and exploration of departures from velocity dominance in

greater than the pion's Compton wavelength. In this regime the NN potential is
conjectured to be the sum of a delta function and its derivatives. The question
we address is whether this sum can be consistently truncated at a given order
in the derivative expansion, and systematically improved by going to higher
orders. Regularizing the Lippmann-Schwinger equation using a cutoff we find
that the cutoff can be taken to infinity only if the effective range is
negative. A positive effective range---which occurs in nature---requires that
the cutoff be kept finite and below the scale of the physics which has been
integrated out, i.e. O(m_\pi). Comparison of cutoff schemes and dimensional
regularization reveals that the physical scattering amplitude is sensitive to
the choice of regulator. Moreover, we show that the presence of some regulator
scale, a feature absent in dimensional regularization, is essential if the
effective field theory of NN scattering is to be useful. We also show that one
can define a procedure where finite cutoff dependence in the scattering
amplitude is removed order by order in the effective potential. However, the
characteristic momentum in the problem is given by the cutoff, and not by the
external momentum. It follows that in the presence of a finite cutoff there is
no small parameter in the effective potential, and consequently no systematic
truncation of the derivative expansion can be made. We conclude that there is
no effective field theory of NN scattering with nucleons alone.

two-body Hydrogen atom. We study the entanglement of the electron and proton
coordinates in the exact analytical solution. This entanglement, which we
quantify in the framework of the density matrix formalism, describes
correlations in the electron-proton motion.

to Bob at this moment, she would like to convince Bob that she is committed to
this particular decision and that she cannot change it at a later time. Is
there a way for Alice to get Bob's trust? Until recently, researchers had
believed that the above task can be performed with the help of quantum
mechanics. And the security of the quantum scheme lies on the uncertainty
principle. Nevertheless, such optimism was recently shattered by Mayers and by
us, who found that Alice can always change her mind if she has a quantum
computer. Here, we survey this dramatic development and its implications on the
security of other quantum cryptographic schemes.
