and morphological types. We find that there is some hint of enhanced M(H2)/Lb

control sample, especially for the most compact groups, suggesting that tidal
interactions can drive the gas component inwards, by removing its angular
momentum, and concentrating it in the dense central regions, where it is easily
detected. The molecular gas content in compact group galaxies is similar to
that in pairs and starburst samples. However, the total L(FIR) luminosity of
HCGs is quite similar to that of the control sample, and therefore the star
formation efficiency appears lower than in the control galaxies. However this
assumes that the FIR spatial distributions are similar in both samples which is
not the case at radio frequencies. Higher spatial resolution FIR data are
needed to make a valid comparison. Given their short dynamical friction
time-scale, it is possible that some of these systems are in the final stage
before merging, leading to ultra-luminous starburst phases. We also find for
all galaxy samples that the \htwo content (derived from CO luminosity and
normalised to blue luminosity) is strongly correlated to the L(FIR)luminosity,
while the total gas content H2+HI is not.

moderate dispersion spectroscopy has been transformed to a common [Fe/H] scale
and used to study the local structure and evolution of the galactic disk. The
metallicity distribution of clusters with R_GC is best described by two
distinct zones. Between R_GC = 6.5 and 10 kpc, the distribution has a mean
[Fe/H] = 0.0 and a dispersion of 0.1 dex; there is only weak evidence for a
shallow abundance gradient over this distance range. Beyond R_GC = 10 kpc, the
metallicity distribution has a dispersion between 0.10 and 0.15 dex, but with a
mean [Fe/H] = -0.3, implying a sharp discontinuity at R_GC = 10 kpc. After
correcting for the discontinuity, no evidence is found for a gradient
perpendicular to the plane. Adopting the clusters interior to 10 kpc as a
representative sample of the galactic disk over the last 7 Gyr, the cluster
metallicity range is found to be about half that of the field stars. When
coupled with the discontinuity in the galactocentric gradient, the discrepancy
in the metallicity distribution is interpreted as an indication of significant
diffusion of field stars into the solar neighborhood from beyond 10 kpc. These
results imply that the sun is NOT atypical of the stars formed in the solar
circle 4.6 Gyr ago. It is suggested that the discontinuity reflects the edge of
the initial galactic disk as defined by the disk globular cluster system and
the so-called thick disk; the initial offset in [Fe/H] created by the
differences in the chemical history on either side of the discontinuity has
carried through to the current stage of galactic evolution. If correct,
diffusion coupled with the absence of an abundance gradient could make the
separation of field stars on the basis of galactocentric origin difficult.

found that there is detectable high-energy gamma-ray emission above the

hardness ratio is introduced to characterize the evolution of the spectral
index as a function of pulsar phase. While the hardest emission from the Crab

the hardest emission from Geminga corresponds to the second gamma-ray peak. For
all three pulsars, phase-resolved spectra of the pulse profile components
reveal that although there is a large variation in the spectral index over the
pulsar phase interval, the high-energy spectral turnover, if any, occurs at
roughly the same energy in each component. The high-energy gamma-ray emission
from the Crab complex appears to include an unpulsed ultra-soft component of

quantity of dust (as first inferred from its mm-wave detection by Ivison 1995)
but also allow the first meaningful constraints to be placed on the mass of
this dust and associated gas. The new measurements consist of: (i) clear
detections of sub-mm continuum emission at 450 and 850um obtained with the new
sub-mm bolometer array, SCUBA, on the JCMT, (ii) continuum upper limits at 350,
750 and 175um obtained with SCUBA and the PHT far-IR camera aboard ISO, and
(iii) a sensitive upper limit on the CO(4-3) line flux obtained with the IRAM
30-m MRT. The resulting rest-frame 33- to 238-um continuum coverage allows us
to deduce that 2E8 Msun of dust at a temperature of 40 +/- 5 K is responsible
for the observed mm/sub-mm emission. Using our CO upper limit, which constrains
M(H2)/M(dust) to <950, we go on to calculate robust limits on the total gas
reserves (H2 + HI) which are thereby constrained to between 4E10 and 1.2E12
Msun. The sub-mm properties of 8C1435+635 are thus strikingly similar to those
of the z = 3.80 radio galaxy, 4C41.17, the only other high-redshift galaxy
detected to date at sub-mm wavelengths whose properties appear not to be
exaggerated by gravitational lensing (Dunlop et al. 1994; Hughes, Dunlop &
Rawlings 1997). The inferred gas masses of both objects are sufficiently large
to suggest that the formative starbursts of massive elliptical galaxies are
still in progress at around z = 4. Observations of complete samples of radio
galaxies spanning a range of redshifts and radio luminosities will be required
to determine if the spectacular far-IR properties of 8C1435+635 and 4C41.17 are
primarily due to their extreme redshifts or their extreme radio luminosities.

Schwarzschild's (1979) method for the numerical construction of self-consistent
equilibria with arbitrary time-independent potentials, generalising thereby an
approach developed by Vandervoort (1984) for integrable potentials. As a simple
illustration, Schwarzschild's method is reformulated to allow for a
straightforward computation of equilibria which depend only on one or two
global integrals and no other quantities, as is reasonable, e.g., for modeling
axisymmetric configurations characterised by a nonintegrable potential.

it is impossible to observe interference effects between histories which

experimental manifestation of such a state is the coexistence of incoherent,
non-metallic transport in one or two directions with coherent transport in at

dimensions in external electromagnetic fields. The effectve action is

squared and the free energy in Yukwava theory to two and three-loop order,
respectively, in resummed perturbation theory. The main part of the present
work is on effective field theories at finite temperature. I discuss the
concepts of dimensional reduction, modern renormalization theory, and
renormalizable field theories (``fundamental theories'') versus
non-renormalizable theories (``effective theories''). Two methods for
constructing effective three dimensional field theories are discussed. The
first is based on the effective potential, and is applied to field theory with
$N$ charged U(N) symmetric scalar coupled to an Abelian gauge field. The second
method is an effective field theory approach based on diagrammatical methods,
recently developed by Braaten and Nieto. I apply the methods to various
problems in spinor and scalar QED.

important fact that the quantities n!p(n) are moments of a quasiprobability
distribution, notwithstanding the fact that p(n)'s can by themselves be
considered as a probability distribution over the nonnegative integers. This
leads to local classicality conditions involving p(n)'s for only a small number
