effect on metal elements provides a possibility of placing constraints on the
spectral shape of the metagalactic UV background (MUVB). From theoretical point
of view, the most optimum indicator of the spectral shape of the MUVB is the
ratio OIV/OIII. Unlike previous thought, the ratio SiIV/CIV is not a good
indicator of the spectral shape because of its strong dependence on an
ionization parameter as well. We also find that the observed excess of CIV
systems in luminous QSOs may be a photoionization effect, but not a
gravitational lensing effect.

  Models without Size Evolution?","12 pages, LaTeX (aaspp4.sty), accepted by ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/310969",,"astro-ph",,"  We develop an idealized inside-out formation model for disk galaxies to
include a realistic mix of galaxy types and luminosities that provides a fair
match to the traditional observables. The predictions of our infall models are
compared against identical models with no-size evolution by generating fully
realistic simulations of the HDF, from which we recover the angular size
distributions. We find that our infall models produce nearly identical angular
size distributions to those of our no-size evolution models in the case of a
Omega = 0 geometry but produce slightly smaller sizes in the case of a Omega =
1 geometry, a difference we associate with the fact that there is a different
amount of cosmic time in our two models for evolving to relatively low
redshifts (z \approx 1-2). Our infall models also predict a slightly smaller
(11% - 29%) number of large (disk scale lengths > 4 h_{50} ^{-1} kpc) galaxies
at z \approx 0.7 for the CFRS as well as different increases in the central
surface brightness of the disks for early-type spirals, the infall model
predicting an increase by 1.2 magnitudes out to z \approx 2 (Omega = 0), 1
(Omega = 1), while our no-size evolution models predict an increase of only 0.5
magnitude. This result suggests that infall models could be important for
explaining the 1.2-1.6 magnitude increase in surface brightness reported by
Schade et al. (1995, 1996a, 1996b).

compact cores. Eleven of the 16 core-jet (including one two-sided jet) sources
show some evidence of bent jets. No compact doubles were found. A comparison
with previous images and the temporal variability of the radio flux density
showed evidence for superluminal motion in 4 of the sources. Five sources were
high energy (>100 MeV) gamma-ray sources. Statistical analysis showed the
dominance of highly polarized quasars among the detected gamma-ray sources,
which emphasizes the importance of beaming effect in the gamma-ray emission.

hierarchical cosmologies. In particular, we describe a measurement of the
baryon content of the universe obtained by matching the average opacity of the
Lyman alpha forest from simulations to the observed one from a new dataset
observed with the Keck telescope. We then report on a search for possible small
scale structure in the intergalactic medium which could be unresolved by
current cosmological simulations. Observing column density gradients in the
spectra of lensed QSOs we find the typical intergalactic gas cloud to be
structureless down to at least the 4 % level, on scales of 0.1 kpc. Extending
the study of lensed absorption to higher column densities we begin to sample
the velocity field internal to high redshift galaxies. Remarkable differences
in column density (of order 50 %) and projected velocity (tens of km/s) between
lines of sight separated by only a few hundred parsecs are found, and we may be
observing structure in the early interstellar medium.

small adiabatic gravitational perturbations. For odd spherical harmonics, the
response is identical to the response of the analogous isothermal fluid system.
For even spherical harmonics, the response can be regarded as an infinite
series of wavetrains in $\log r$, implying alternating compression and
rarefaction in equal logarithmic radius intervals. Partly because of the
oscillatory nature of the solutions, tidal fields from external sources are not
strongly amplified by an intervening isothermal stellar system, except at radii
$\lta 10^{-3.5}$ times the satellite radius; at some radii the stellar system
can even screen the external tidal field in a manner analogous to Debye
screening. As Weinberg has pointed out, individual resonances in a stellar
system can strongly amplify external tidal fields over a limited radial range,
but we cannot address this possibility because we examine only adiabatic
perturbations. We also discuss the application of our method to the halo
response caused by the slow growth of an embedded thin disk.

forest in a CDM model using numerical simulations including collisionless
particles only. The baryonic component is assumed to follow the dark matter
distribution. We distinguish between two populations of particles: Population
P{s} traces the filamentary structures of the dark matter, evolves slowly with
redshift and, for N(HI)>10^14 cm^-2, dominates the number density of lines at
z<3; most of population P{u} is located in underdense regions and for the same
column densities, disappears rapidly at high redshift. We generate synthetic
spectra from the simulation and show that the redshift evolution of the
Lyman-alpha forest (decrement, N(HI) distribution) is well reproduced over the
whole redshift range for Omega_b*h^2=0.0125 and J_-21=0.1 at z=3 where J_-21 is
the UV background flux intensity in units of 10^-21 erg cm^-2 s^-1 Hz^-1 sr^-1.
The total number of lines with N(HI)>10^12 cm^-2 remains approximately constant
from z=4 to z=1. At z=0, the number density of lines per unit redshift with log
N(HI)>12, 13, 14 is of the order of 400, 100, and 20 respectively. Therefore,
at low redshift, if most of the strong (w_r>0.3 \AA) lines are expected to be
associated with galaxies, the bulk of the Lyman-alpha forest however should
have lower equivalent width and should not be tightly correlated with galaxies.

realistic description of deconfinement transition. Deconfinement cannot be

Quark-gluon plasma and hadron clusters are different quantum states of the same
