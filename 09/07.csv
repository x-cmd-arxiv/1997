grown in $BaZrO_3$ crucibles reveal new properties that are not directly seen
in similar measurements of other YBCO samples. Two key observations obtained
from complex conductivity are: a new normal conductivity peak at around 80K and
additional pairing below 65K. High pressure oxygenation of one of the crystals
still yields the same results ruling out any effect of macroscopic segregation
of O-deficient regions. A single complex order parameter cannot describe these
data, and the results suggest at least two superconducting components.
Comparisons with model calculations done for various decoupled two-component
scenarios (i.e. s+d, d+d) are presented. Systematics of three single crystals
show that the 80K quasiparticle peak is correlated with the normal state
inelastic scattering rate. Close to Tc, the data follow a mean-field behavior.
Overall, our results strongly suggest the presence of multiple pairing
temperature and energy scales in $YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.95}$.

localized level and conduction band has been studied using the exact
diagonalization method. We obtain the single-particle density of states and the
valency from this method and analyze the behaviors of valence transition and
activation gap. We find that the valence transition is continuous due to
hybridization, while the activation gap closes discontinuously. Moreover, the
onset of the valence transition and the closing point of the activation gap
mismatch each other. Our result is well consistent with the recent experiment
on SmB_6.

image of the Gauss map is bounded from one side, then the spacelike constant
mean curvature hypersurface must be linear. This result extends the previous
theorems obtained by B. Palmer and Y.L. Xin where they assume that the image of

is determined by the past endpoints of the EH. A torus EH (the collision of two
EH) is caused by the two-dimensional (one-dimensional) set of the endpoints. In
the present article, we examine the stability of the topology of the EH. We see
that a simple case of a single spherical EH is unstable. Furthermore, in
general, an EH with handles (a torus, a double torus, ...) is structurally
stable in the sense of catastrophe theory.

Pade Approximants (PA's) for resumming perturbative series in QCD. It is shown
that PA's tend to reduce the renormalization scale and scheme dependence as
compared to truncated series. In particular it is proven that in the limit
where the $\beta$ function is dominated by the 1-loop contribution, there is an
exact symmetry that guarantees invariance of diagonal PA's under changing the
renormalization scale. In addition it is shown that in the large $\beta_0$
approximation diagonal PA's can be interpreted as a systematic method for
approximating the flow of momentum in Feynman diagrams. This corresponds to a
new multiple scale generalization of the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) method
to higher orders. I illustrate the method with the Bjorken sum rule and the
vacuum polarization function.

the initial expression of physical theory must occur in a context of

formalism of quantum mechanics occurs first, but not necessarily with the usual
interpretations. The basis for this work is a non-commutative discrete calculus
and the observation that it takes one tick of the discrete clock to measure
