starburst nucleus galaxy Mrk 1259. The estimated number ratio of Wolf-Rayet
(WR) to O stars amounts to ~0.09. While the nuclear emission-line region is due
to usual photoionization by massive stars, the circumnuclear emission-line
regions show anomalous line ratios that can be due to cooling shocks. Since the
host galaxy seems to be a face-on disk galaxy and the excitation conditions of
the circumnuclear emission-line regions show the spatial symmetry, we consider
that we are seeing the superwind nearly from a pole-on view. Cooling shock
models may explain the observed emission line ratios of the circumnuclear
regions although a factor of 2 overabundance of nitrogen is necessary. All
these suggest that the high-mass enhanced starburst occurred ~5X10^6 years ago
in the nuclear region of Mrk 1259.

spectroscopic features. Simultaneous H{alpha}, Na I D{1}, D{2}, and He I D{3}
spectroscopic observations are reported here for 18 systems. The chromospheric
contribution in these lines have been determined using the spectral subtraction
technique. Very broad wings have been found in the subtracted H{alpha} profile
of some of the more active stars. These profiles are well matched using a
two-components Gaussian fit (narrow and broad) and the broad component could be
interpreted as arising from microflaring. Prominence-like extended material
have been detected in a near-eclipse H{alpha} observation of the system AR Lac.
The excess emission found in the Na I D{1} and D{2} lines by application of the
spectral subtraction technique and the behaviour of the H{alpha} line in the
corresponding simultaneous observations indicate that the filling-in of the
core of these lines is a chromospheric activity indicator. For giant stars of
the sample the He I D{3} line has been detected in absorption in the subtracted
spectra. An optical flare has been detected in UX Ari and II Peg through the
presence of the He I D{3} in emission in coincidence with the enhancement of

representation formulation of the canonical theory to the causal set

special classes of causal sets, which consist of spin networks representing
quantum states of the gravitational field joined together by labeled null
edges. The theory exists in 3+1, 2+1 and 1+1 dimensional versions, and may also
be interepreted as a theory of labeled timelike surfaces. The dynamics is
specified by a choice of functions of the labelings of d+1 dimensional
simplices,which represent elementary future light cones of events in these
discrete spacetimes. The quantum dynamics thus respects the discrete causal
structure of the causal sets. In the 1+1 dimensional case the theory is closely
related to directed percolation models. In this case, at least, the theory may
have critical behavior associated with percolation, leading to the existence of
a classical limit.

the gauging forbids the existence of a magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos term.

bulk properties of nuclear matter, with the exception of nuclear binding.
Furthermore, it was postulated that this model with the inclusion of the
colour-hyperfine interaction should produce binding. In some recent work a
modified version of the string-flip potential model was developed, called the
flux-bubble model, which would allow for the addition of perturbative QCD
interactions. In attempts to construct a simple $q\bar q$ nucleon system using
the flux-bubble model (which only included colour-Coulomb interactions)
difficulties arise with trying to construct a many-body variational wave
function that would take into account the locality of the flux-bubble
interactions. In this paper we look at a toy system, a mesonic molecule, in
order to understand these difficulties. {\it En route}, a new variational wave
function is proposed that may have a sufficient impact on the old string-flip
potential model results that the inclusion of perturbative effects may not be
needed.

the stochastic variational method. Depending on the available computational
resources the program is applicable for $N=2-3-4-5-6-...$-body systems with
$L=0$ total orbital momentum. The solution with the stochastic variational
method is ``automatic'' and universal. One defines the system (number of
particles, masses, symmetry, interaction, etc. ) and the program finds the
ground state energy and wave function. The examples include nuclear (alpha
particle: four-body, $^6$He: six-body), atomic (td$\mu^-$ and $e^+e^-e^+e^-$)
and subnuclear (the nucleon and the delta in a nonrelativistic quark model)
systems. The solutions are accurate for excited states as well, and even the
Efimov-states can be studied. The program is available from the author

constant expressions use a temperature-dependent activation energy. They give
better agreement with the available experimental results than do previous
empirical fits. Since all but one of the parameters in the present expressions
are obtained from theory, rather than by fitting to experimental reaction
rates, the expressions can be expected to be more dependable than purely
empirical expressions at temperatures above 2000 K or below 350 K, where
experimental results are not available.

perspective centered on quantum conditional and mutual entropies. This approach
parallels the description of classical error correction in Shannon theory,
while clarifying the differences between classical and quantum codes. More
specifically, it is shown how quantum information theory accounts for the fact
that ""redundant"" information can be distributed over quantum bits even though
this does not violate the quantum ""no-cloning"" theorem. Such a remarkable
feature, which has no counterpart for classical codes, is related to the
property that the ternary mutual entropy vanishes for a tripartite system in a
pure state. This information-theoretic description of quantum coding is used to
derive the quantum analogue of the Singleton bound on the number of logical
bits that can be preserved by a code of fixed length which can recover a given
number of errors.
