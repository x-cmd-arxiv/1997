light curves which seem to be due to lensing by a dark point mass. Theory
predicts that many microlensing events should display significant deviations
from the standard form. Lens binarity in particular is expected to be common.
So far, however, only a handful of light curves exhibit evidence that the lens
is a binary; all of these display dramatic deviations from the standard light
curve, exhibiting pronounced multiple peaks and/or caustic crossings.
Binary-lens events in which the light curve is less dramatically perturbed
should also exist in the data set. Why, then, have we not detected them? The
answer may lie in the fact that the perturbations, though often significant,
tend to be less distinctive than those associated with caustic crossings.
  We present a method to determine whether a light curve is due to lensing by a
binary. The method works for both gently and dramatically perturbed binary-lens
light curves. Our method identifies all degenerate solutions-- i.e., all
possible lensing events that might have given rise to the observed light curve.
It also enables us to eliminate from consideration large ranges of possible
false positive identifications associated with light curves that might mimic
microlensing by a binary. This method, or a generalization of it, can also be
applied to the analysis of light curves that deviate from the standard
point-mass lens form because of astronomical effects other than lens binarity.

the dominant source of opacity. We solve numerically and approximately
analytically the equation of radiative transfer in the case of spherical,
steady state accretion into black holes. Unlike previous work on this subject,
we consider the inner boundary at a finite radius and this has a significant
effect on the emergent spectrum. It is shown that the bulk motion of the
converging flow is more efficient in upscattering photons than thermal
Comptonization, provided that the electron temperature in the flow is of order
a few keV or less. In this case, the spectrum observed at infinity consists of
a soft component coming from those input photons which escaped after a few
scatterings without any significant energy change and of a power law which
extends to high energies and is made of those photons which underwent
significant upscattering. The luminosity of the power law is relatively small
compared to that of the soft component. The more reflective the inner boundary
is, the flatter the power-law spectrum becomes. The spectral energy power-law
index for black-hole accretion is always higher than 1 and it is approximately
1.5 for high accretion rates. This result tempts us to say that bulk motion
Comptonization might be the mechanism behind the power-law spectra seen in
black-hole X-ray sources.

exponential distribution of the logarithm of the growth rate in agreement with
the empirical results. Then, we study a hierarchical tree-like model of a
company that enables us to relate the two parameters of the model to the
exponent $\beta$, which describes the dependence of the standard deviation of
the distribution of growth rates on size. We find that $\beta = -\ln \Pi / \ln
z$, where $z$ defines the mean branching ratio of the hierarchical tree and
$\Pi$ is the probability that the lower levels follow the policy of higher
levels in the hierarchy. We also study the distribution of growth rates of this
hierarchical model. We find that the distribution is consistent with the
exponential form found empirically.

Sci. and Tech. June 1997",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics,
particles which are localized in space by a bounding potential must have a
finite distribution of momenta. This leads, even in the lowest-possible energy
state, to vibrations, and thus, to the so-called zero-point energy. For
chemically bound hydrogen the zero-point energy can be quite substantial. For
example, for a free H_2 molecule it is 0.26 eV, a significant value in the
realm of chemistry, where often an energy of the order of 0.1 eV/atom (or 2.3
kcal/mol) decides whether or not a chemical reaction takes place with an
appreciable rate. Yet, in many theoretical studies the dynamics of chemical
reactions involving hydrogen has been treated classically or quasi-classically,
assuming that the quantum mechanical nature of H nuclei, i.e. the zero-point
effects, will not strongly affect the relevant physical or chemical properties.
In this paper we show that this assumption is not justified. We will
demonstrate that for very basic and fundamental catalytic-reaction steps,
namely the dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen at transition metal
surfaces and its time-reverse process, the associative desorption, zero-point
effects can not only quantitatively but even qualitatively affect the chemical
processes and rates. Our calculations (treating electrons as well as H nuclei
quantum-mechanically) establish the importance of additional zero-point effects
generated by the H_2-surface interaction and how energy of the H-H stretch
vibration is transferred into those and vice versa.

is much larger than $k_B$ and depends on the distribution of the velocity field
$v_s$ around the vortex. If there is a first order transition with the change
of the velocity distribution, then there will be a big entropy jump $\Delta S_V
\sim 1 k_B$ at the transition. This entropy jump comes from the electronic
degrees of freedom on the vortex background, which is modified by the vortex
transition. This can explain the big jump in the entropy observed in the
so-called vortex-melting transition [A. Junod, et. al., Physica C 27, 245
(1997)], in which the vortex array and thus the velocity field are
redistributed. The possibility of the Berezinskii- Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition in the 3-dimensional d-wave superconductor due to the fermionic
bound states in the vortex background is discussed.

blockade effects beyond the perturbative regime. For this purpose we study the
real-time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system. In the first
part of the paper we present a diagrammatic expansion for not too high junction
conductance, $h/4\pi^2e^2 R_t \lesssim 1$, in a basis of charge states. Quantum
fluctuations renormalize system parameters and lead to finite lifetime
broadening in the gate-voltage dependent differential conductance. We derive
analytic results for the spectral density and the conductance in the limit
where only two charge states play a role. In the second part of the paper we
consider junctions with large conductance, $h/4e^2 R_t \gtrsim 1$. In this case
contributions from all charge states, which broaden and overlap, become
important. We analyze the problem in a quasiclassical approximation. The two
complementary approaches cover the essential features of electron tunneling for
all parameters.

of the propagation of charged particles coupled to a a Chern-Simons gauge

interpolates between the different boundary conditions of the two sectors and
so provides a dynamical picture for the GSO-projection.

nine in the Skyrme model, generated using sophisticated numerical algorithms.
Assuming the Skyrme model accurately represents the low energy limit of QCD,
these configurations correspond to the classical nuclear ground states of the
light elements. The solitons found are particularly symmetric, for example, the
charge seven skyrmion has icosahedral symmetry, and the shapes are shown to fit
a remarkable sequence defined by a geometric energy minimization (GEM) rule. We
also calculate the energies and sizes to within at least a few percent
accuracy. These calculations provide the basis for a future investigation of
the low energy vibrational modes of skyrmions and hence the possibility of
testing the Skyrme model against experiment.

for Hirota - Satsuma equation. Interestingly our supersymmetric equation is not
reducible to classical Hirota - Satsuma equation. We show that our generalized
system is reduced to the one of the supersymmetric KDV equation (a=4) but in
this limit integrals of motion are not reduced to integrals of motion of the
supersymmetric KdV equation.

enumeration problem, we obtain the generating function $H(x)$ of all

number of indecomposable 1342-avoiding permutations of length $n$ equals that
of labeled plane trees of a certain type on $n$ vertices recently enumerated by
Cori, Jacquard and Schaeffer, which is in turn known to be equal to the number
of rooted bicubic maps enumerated by Tutte in 1963. Moreover, $H(x)$ turns out
to be algebraic, proving the first nonmonotonic, longer-than-three instance of
a conjecture of Zeilberger and Noonan. We also prove that $\sqrt[n]{S_n(1342)}$
converges to 8, so in particular, $lim_{n\rightarrow

excitation significantly modifies the potential barrier distribution. In sharp
contrast, fusion of ^{16}O + ^{144}Sm appears to show no influence of the
projectile excitation on the shape of the barrier distribution. These
apparently conflicting conclusions are reconciled in this work, using realistic
coupled--channels calculations, which show that high energy states produce an
adiabatic potential renormalisation. This result indicates that adiabatic
effects restrict, in a natural way, the states which influence the shape of a
fusion barrier distribution. The analysis of barrier distributions thus offers
a criterion for the relevance of the `counter term' prescription in the
Caldeira-Leggett approach.

is shown that the interplay between $\omega$-meson exchange and box diagrams
(two-meson exchange with simultaneous excitation of one or two nucleons to
$\Delta$'s) mainly rules the longitudinal response, while in the transverse one
the direct $\Delta$ excitations almost cancel the one-loop correction and the
response is mainly governed by the $\rho$-meson rescattering inside the
nucleus. It is also shown that a small variation in the nuclear densities may
explain the observed discrepancies between different nuclei.

work with operads having an arbitrary set S of types, or `S-operads', and given
such an operad O, we denote its set of operations by elt(O). Then for any
S-operad O there is an elt(O)-operad O+ whose algebras are S-operads over O.
Letting I be the initial operad with a one-element set of types, and defining
I(0) = I, I(i+1) = I(i)+, we call the operations of I(n-1) the `n-dimensional
opetopes'. Opetopes form a category, and presheaves on this category are called
`opetopic sets'. A weak n-category is defined as an opetopic set with certain
properties, in a manner reminiscent of Street's simplicial approach to weak
omega-categories. Similarly, starting from an arbitrary operad O instead of I,
we define `n-coherent O-algebras', which are n times categorified analogs of
algebras of O. Examples include `monoidal n-categories', `stable n-categories',
`virtual n-functors' and `representable n-prestacks'. We also describe how
n-coherent O-algebra objects may be defined in any (n+1)-coherent O-algebra.
