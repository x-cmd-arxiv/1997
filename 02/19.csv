gravitational lens system 0957+561. Averaged over all of our data, the
rest-frame velocity dispersion sigma_v of the central lens galaxy G1 is sigma_v
= 279 +- 12 km/s. However, there appears to be a significant decrease in
sigma_v as a function of distance from the center of G1 that is not typical of
brightest cluster galaxies. Within 0.2"" of the center of G1, we find the
average sigma_v = 316+- 14 km/s, whereas for positions > 0.2"" from the center
of G1, we find the average sigma_v= 266+-12 km/s. A plausible explanation is
that G1 contains a central massive dark object of mass M_MDO ~ 4x10^9
h_100^{-1} M_sun (h_100 = H_0/100km/s/Mpc), which contributes to the central
velocity dispersion, and that the outer value of sigma_v is the appropriate
measure of the depth of the potential well of G1. The determination of a
luminosity-weighted estimate of sigma_v is essential for a determination of H_0
from 0957+561; our accurate measurements remove one of the chief uncertainties
in the assumed form of the mass distribution of the lens. Thus, with the recent
apparent reduction in the uncertainty in the measurement of the time delay for
the images A and B of 0957+561, Delta tau_BA = 417+-3 d (Kundic et al. 1996),
we obtain an estimate for the Hubble constant: H_0 = 62+-7 km/s/Mpc. If for
some reason the trend of sigma_v with slit position is spurious and we should
use the dispersion averaged along the slit, then the estimate of H_0 increases
to 67+-8 km/s/Mpc. These standard errors do not, however, include any
contribution from any errors in the assumed form of the mass distribution of
the lens. In particular, we used the mass model described by Falco, Gorenstein
& Shapiro (1991), as updated by Grogin & Narayan (1996a, b). The reduced chi^2

binaries and cataclysmic variables whose evolution is driven by the nuclear
expansion of the secondary star on the first giant branch. Stable accretion is
confined to neutron-star systems where the secondary is still relatively
massive, and some supersoft white dwarf accretors. All other systems, including
all black-hole systems, appear as soft X-ray transients or dwarf novae. All
long-period neutron-star systems become transient well before most of the
envelope mass is transferred, and remain transient until envelope exhaustion.
This complicates attempts to compare the numbers of millisecond pulsars in the
Galactic disk with their LMXB progenitors, and also means that the pulsar spin
rates are fixed in systems which are transient rather than steady, contrary to
common assumption. The long-period persistent sources Sco X-2, LMC X-2, Cyg X-2
and V395 Car must have minimum companion masses > 0.75 Msun if they contain
neutron stars, and still larger masses if they contain black holes. The
companion in the neutron-star transient GRO J1744-2844 must have a mass <0.87
Msun. The existence of any steady sources at all at long periods supports the
ideas that (a) the accretion disks in many, if not all, LMXBs are strongly
irradiated by the central source, and (b) mass transfer is thermally unstable
in long-period supersoft X-ray sources.

so as to reproduce the main observational biases and are analysed by applying
the same algorithm for interlopers removal and velocity dispersion estimate as

clusters can be largely affected by observational biases in a model-dependent
way: models in which clusters had less time to virialize show larger
discrepancies between 3D and projected velocity dispersions. From the
comparison with real clusters we find that both SCDM and TCDM largely
overproduce clusters. The CHDM model marginally overproduces clusters and
requires a somewhat larger sigma_8 than a purely CDM model in order to produce
the same cluster abundance. The LCDM model with Omega_0=0.3 agrees with data,

being an idiosyncratic notion to being one of the major baryonic repositories
in the Universe. The story of their discovery and the characterization of their
properties is told here. Their recovery from the noise of the night sky
background is a strong testament to the severity of surface brightness
selection effects. LSB galaxies have a number of remarkable properties which
distinguish them from the more familiar Hubble Sequence of spirals. The two
most important are 1) they evolve at a significantly slower rate and may well
experience star formation outside of the molecular cloud environment, 2) they
are embedded in dark matter halos which are of lower density and more extended
than the halos around high surface brightness (HSB) disk galaxies. Compared to
HSB disks, LSB disks are strongly dark matter dominated at all radii and show a
systematic increase in M/L with central surface brightness.
  In addition, the recognition that large numbers of LSB galaxies actually
exist has changed the form of the galaxy luminosity function and has clearly
increased the space density of galaxies at z = 0. Recent CCD surveys have
uncovered a population of red LSB disks that may be related to the excess of
faint blue galaxies detected at moderate redshifts. LSB galaxies offer us a new
window into galaxy evolution and formation which is every bit as important as
those processes which have produced easy to detect galaxies. Indeed, the
apparent youth of some LSB galaxies suggest that galaxy formation is a greatly
extended process. While the discovery of LSB galaxies have lead to new
insights, it remains unwise to presume that we now have a representative sample
which encompasses all galaxy types and forms.

The differential peak flux distribution is corrected for threshold effects at

Within an Einstein-de Sitter cosmology, we place strong bounds on the evolution

assuming a power law spectrum and no luminosity evolution. Additionally, under
the implied conditions of moderate evolution, the 90% width of the observed

crossing the Earth mantle, the core, the inner 2/3 of the core, and the (core +

for the survival probability in the indicated cases are obtained for a large

that of cosmic strings; this falls as $\beta$ is increased and above $\beta =
1$, where the string solution is dynamically unstable, no semilocal strings
form. We show the results are robust by examining different initial conditions
where, as expected in a thermal environment, the initial scalar field need not
be on the vacuum. We discuss implications for the three-dimensional case.

confining potential into the scalar part of the vector potential. Using a Green
function formalism, we derive the self-energy for this model, which has both
scalar and vector parts, $\Sigma^S(p)$ and $\Sigma^V(p)$. A rotation of these
variables leads to the so-called gap and energy equations. We then analyse the
divergence structure of these equations. As this depends explicitly on the form
of potential, we give as examples both the linear plus Coulomb and
quadratically confining potentials. The nature of the confining single particle
Green function is investigated, and shown to be divergent due to the infrared
singularities caused by the confining potential. Solutions to the gap equation
for the simpler case of quadratic confinement are found both semi-analytically
and numerically. At finite temperatures, the coupled set of equations are
solved numerically in two decoupling approximations. Although chiral symmetry
is found only to be exactly restored as $T\to\infty$, the chiral condensate
displays a steep drop over a somewhat small temperature range.

  In Interval Spaces","40 pages, correction of format",,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  One of shortcomings of stepwise interval methods is the following. The
intervals determining the solution of a system are often expanded in the course
of time irrespective of the method and step used (the {\em Moore effect}). We
introduce the notion of general {\em interval spaces} and study the
infinitesimal Moore effect (IME) in these spaces. We obtain the local
conditions of absence of the IME in terms of Jacobi matrices field. The
relation between the absence of IME and simultaneous dissipativity of the
Jacobi matrices is established. We study simultaneously dissipative operators
in $\Bbb{R}^n$. A linear operator $A$ is {\em dissipative} with respect to a
norm $\|...\|$ if $\| \exp (At) \| \leq 1$ at all $t \geq 0$. For each norm,
the dissipative operator form a closed convex cone. An operator $A$ is {\em
stable dissipative} if it belongs to the interior of this cone. The family of
linear operators $\{A_\alpha \}$ is called {\em simultaneously dissipative}, if
there exists a norm with respect to which all the operators are dissipative. We
studied general properties of such families. For example, let the family
$\{A_\alpha \}$ be finite and generate a nilpotent Lee algebra and let for each
$A_\alpha$ there exist a norm with respect to which it is dissipative. Then
$\{A_\alpha \}$ is simultaneously dissipative. Let the family $\{A_\alpha \}$
be compact and generate solvable Lee algebra, and let the spectrum of each
operator $A_\alpha $ lie in the open left half-plane. Then $\{A_\alpha \}$ is
simultaneously stable dissipative, i.e. there exists a norm with respect to
which all $A_\alpha $ are stable dissipative. We study the conditions of
simultaneous dissipativity of the matrices of rank one and discussed their
application to equations of {\em mass action law} kinetics.

Varagnolo and Vasserot. The proof is based on certain non-trivial properties of
Cherednik's commuting difference operators. The quantum toroidal action on the
Fock space depends on a certain parameter. We find that with a specific choice
of this parameter the action on the Fock spaces gives rise to the toroidal
action on irreducible level-1 highest weight modules of the affine quantum
algebra $U_q(\hat{sl}_n)$. Similarly, by a specific choice of the parameter,
the level (1,0) vertex representation of the quantum toroidal algebra gives
rise to a $U_q(sl_n,tor)$-module structure on irreducible level-1 highest
weight $U_q(\hat{sl}_n)$-modules.
