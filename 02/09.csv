to investigate the stellar populations of these galaxies. Relations are
established between the line indices (Mg2, <Fe>, Hbeta) and the velocity
dispersions, the masses of the galaxies, the M/L ratios and the cluster
environment. The difference between the slope of the Mg2-sigma relation and the
slope of the <Fe>-sigma relation indicates that the abundance ratio [Mg/Fe]
increases with the velocity dispersion. The <Fe> index is stronger correlated
with the projected cluster surface density, than with the galaxy mass or the
velocity dispersion. Also the Mg2 index depends on the cluster environment. The
dependence on the environment implies that [Mg/Fe] decreases with increasing
density. The M/L ratios are strongly correlated with the Mg2 and Hbeta, while
<Fe> is only weakly correlated with the M/L ratio.
  Based on current stellar population models it is not yet possible to derive
unique physical parameters (mean age, mean abundances, mean IMF, and fraction
of dark matter) from the observables (line indices, velocity dispersion, mass,
M/L ratio).

an inhomogeneous ferromagnet. No assumption is made regarding the underlying
distribution of the data. We assign a Potts spin to each data point and
introduce an interaction between neighboring points, whose strength is a
decreasing function of the distance between the neighbors. This magnetic system
exhibits three phases. At very low temperatures it is completely ordered; all
spins are aligned. At very high temperatures the system does not exhibit any
ordering and in an intermediate regime clusters of relatively strongly coupled
spins become ordered, whereas different clusters remain uncorrelated. This
intermediate phase is identified by a jump in the order parameters. The
spin-spin correlation function is used to partition the spins and the
corresponding data points into clusters. We demonstrate on three synthetic and
three real data sets how the method works. Detailed comparison to the
performance of other techniques clearly indicates the relative success of our
method.

bilinear pairings in its cohomology generalizing the usual notions of
Poincar\'e duality in Lie algebra cohomology and de Rham cohomology. We show
that the duality isomorphisms can be given by a cap product with a suitable
fundamental class and hence may be taken natural in any reasonable sense.
Thereafter, for a Lie-Rinehart algebra satisfying duality, we introduce a
certain intrinsic module which provides a crucial ingredient for the
construction of the bilinear pairings. This module determines a certain class,
called modular class of the Lie-Rinehart algebra, which lies in a certain
Picard group generalizing the abelian group of flat line bundles on a smooth
manifold. Finally, we show that a Poisson algebra having suitable properties
determines a certain module for the corrresponding Lie-Rinehart algebra and
hence modular class whose square yields the module and characteristic class for
its Lie-Rinehart algebra mentioned before. In particular, this gives rise to
certain bilinear pairings in Poisson homology.

Within this approach the functional integration over the gluon fields can be
performed and therefore any gluonic vacuum observable can be expressed in terms
of a quark operator and the gluon propagator. As a special case we calculate
the mixed quark gluon condensate. We investigate how the value depends on the
form of the model quark-quark interaction. A comparison with the results of
quenched lattice QCD, the instanton liquid model and QCD sum rules is drawn.

the definition of momentum in curved space. Special emphasis is given to field
theory in anti-de Sitter space, as it represents a maximally symmetric
space-time of constant curvature which could arise in the local description of
matter interactions in small regions of space-time. Transform space rules for
evaluating Feynman diagrams in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space are initially
defined using eigenfunctions based on generalized plane waves. It is shown
that, for a general curved space, the rules associated with the vertex are
dependent on the type of interaction being considered. A condition for
eliminating this dependence is given. It is demonstrated that the vacuum and
propagator in conformally flat coordinates in anti-de Sitter space are
equivalent to those analytically continued from $H^4$ and that transform space
rules based on these coordinates can be used more readily. A proof of the
analogue of Goldstone's theorem in anti-de Sitter space is given, using a
generalized plane wave representation of the commutator of the current and the
scalar field. It is shown that the introduction of curvature in the space-time
shifts the momentum by an amount which is determined by the Riemann tensor to
first order, and it follows that there is a shift in both the momentum and mass
scale in anti-de Sitter space.
