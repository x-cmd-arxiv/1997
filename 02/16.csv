have been generally ignored in quantitative analysis of it, essentially due to
the lack of an objective tool to identify and quantify the voids. To overcome
this, we present the Void-Finder algorithm, a novel tool for objectively
quantifying galaxy voids. The algorithm classifies galaxies as either wall- or
field-galaxies. Then it identifies voids in the wall-galaxy distribution. Voids
are defined as continuous volumes that do not contain any wall-galaxies. The
voids must be thicker than an adjustable limit, which is refined in successive
iterations. We test the algorithm using Voronoi tessellations. By appropriate
scaling of the parameters we apply it to the SSRS2 survey and to the IRAS 1.2
Jy. Both surveys show similar properties: ~50% of the volume is filled by the
voids, which have a scale of at least 40 Mpc, and a -0.9 under-density. Faint
galaxies populate the voids more than bright ones. These results suggest that
both optically and IRAS selected galaxies delineate the same LSS. Comparison
with the recovered mass distribution further suggests that the observed voids
in the galaxy distribution correspond well to under-dense regions in the mass
distribution. This confirms the gravitational origin of the voids.

features near the (pi,0) point of the zone: a sharp peak at low energy and a
higher binding energy hump. We find that the sharp peak persists at low energy
even as one moves towards (0,0), while the broad hump shows significant
dispersion which correlates well with the normal state dispersion. We argue
that these features are naturally explained by the mixing of electrons with a
bosonic mode which appears only below T_c, and speculate that the latter may be
related to the resonance seen in recent neutron data.

studied to investigate the nature of resulting singularity. However, there has
been considerable debate about the admissibility of certain initial density
distributions. Using the Newtonian limit of the equations governing collapse of
a fluid with an equation of state p=p(\rho) it is shown that the density
distribution has to be even function of r in a spherically symmetric situation
provided dp/d\rho \ne 0, even in comoving coordinates. We show that recent
claim by Singh that the discrepancy pointed out earlier is due to their use of
comoving coordinates is totally incorrect. It is surprising that he expects the
use of comoving coordinates to make any difference in this matter. It is also
argued that strong curvature naked singularities in gravitational collapse of
spherically symmetric dust do not violate the cosmic censorship hypothesis.
