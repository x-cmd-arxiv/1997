algebro-geometric technique for studying the moduli spaces of principal
G-bundles on an arbitrary variety X which is elliptically fibered over a base
S: The moduli space itself is naturally fibered over a weighted projective base
parametrizing spectral covers $\tilde{S}$ of S, and the fibers are identified
as translates of distinguished Pryms of these covers. In nice situations, the
generic Prym fiber is isogenous to the product of a finite group and an abelian
subvariety of $Pic(\tilde{S})$.

for the observed quadruple lenses. It is shown that a minimum additional shear
is needed even just to reproduce the observed positions alone. We also obtain
the dependence of the axial ratio, $q$, on the orientation of the major axis of
potential. A general relation also exists between the shear, the position angle
and axial ratio of the lensing galaxy. The relation shows a generic degeneracy
in modelling quadruple lenses. In particular, it shows that only the ratio of
the ellipticity, $\epsilon\equiv (1-q^2)/(1+q^2)$, to the magnitude of shear,
$\gamma$ can be determined. All these results are valid regardless of the
radial profile of the potential. Our formalism applies when the galaxy position
is observed, which is the case for seven of the eight known quadruple lenses.
Application to these seven cases reveals two quadruple lenses CLASS 1608+656
and HST 12531-2914, requiring highly significant shear with magnitude $\approx
0.2$. For HST 12531-2914, there must be a misalignment between the major axis
of light and the major axis of potential (mass). We conclude that detailed
modelling of quadruple lenses can yield valuable quantitative information about
the shape of lensing galaxies and their dark matter halos.

analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing
an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than
using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist
analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language
processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of

SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis.
  In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture,
the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech
recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the
influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that
flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken
language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the
fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a
flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an

model to investigate the possibility of spontaneous ferro- and
antiferromagnetism. Starting point is a two-pole ansatz for the single-electron
spectral density, the free parameter of which can be interpreted as energies
and spectral weights of respective quasiparticle excitations. They are
determined by fitting exactly calculated spectral moments. The resulting
self-energy consists of a local and a non-local part. The higher correlation
functions entering the spin-dependent local part can be expressed as
functionals of the single-electron spectral density. Under certain conditions
for the decisive model parameters (Coulomb interaction U, Bloch-bandwidth W,
band occupation n, temperature T) the local part of the self-energy gives rise
to a spin-dependent band shift, thus allowing for spontaneous band magnetism.
As a function of temperature, second order phase transitions are found away
from half filling, but close to half filling the system exhibits a tendency
towards first order transitions. The non-local self-energy part is determined
by use of proper two-particle spectral densities. Its main influence concerns a
(possibly spin-dependent) narrowing of the quasiparticle bands with the
tendency to stabilize magnetic solutions. The non-local self-energy part
disappears in the limit of infinite dimensions. We present a full evaluation of
the Hubbard model in terms of quasiparticle densities of states, quasiparticle
dispersions, magnetic phase diagram, critical temperatures (Tc, Tn) as well as
spin and particle correlation functions. Special attention is focused on the
non-locality of the electronic self-energy, for which some rigorous limiting

parameters $q$ and $t$. The Hamiltonian of gl(N)-invariant Calogero-Sutherland

$t$ approach the N-th elementary root of unity. This is a generalization of the
well-known situation in the case of Scalar Calogero-Sutherland Model (N=1). In
the limit the commuting family of Macdonald Operators is identified with the
maximal commutative sub-algebra in the Yangian action on the space of states of

Polynomials which we call gl(N)-Jack Polynomials are eigenvectors of this

wide range of intensities and frequencies of the field, from the perturbation
theory to the tunneling regime, and is applicable to the excess-photon as well

relative intensities of the excess-photon peaks, and photoelectron angular
distributions for the hydrogen and halogen negative ions, in agreement with
those obtained in other, more numerically involved calculations in both

sensitivity of the multiphoton detachment probability to the asymptotic
behaviour of the bound-state wave function. Rapid oscillations in the angular

interference of the two classical trajectories which lead to the same final

solutions whose R matrix can be written as a product of delta- functions
depending linearly on the indices. With this ansatz the D^{n(n+1)} equations of
the n-simplex equation reduce to an [n(n+1)/2+1]x[n(n+1)/2+1] matrix equation
over Z_D. We have completely analyzed the 2-, 3- and 4-simplex equations in the
generic D case. The solutions show interesting patterns that seem to continue
to still higher simplex equations.

  submitted to Phys. Rev. A (revised)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We quantise the centre of mass motion of a neutral Cs atom in the presence of
a classical Gaussian-Laguerre$_{10}$ light field in the large detuning limit.
This light field possesses orbital angular momentum which is transferred to the
atom via spontaneous emissions. We use quantum trajectory and analytic methods
to solve the master equation for the 2d centre of mass motion with recoil near
the centre of the beam. For appropriate parameters, we observe heating in both
the cartesian and polar observables within a few orbits of the atom in the
beam. The angular momentum, $\hat{L}$, shows a rapid diffusion which results in
$<\hat{L}>$ reaching a maximum and then decreasing to zero. We compare this
with analytic results obtained for an atom illuminated by a superposition of
Gaussian-Laguerre modes which possess no angular momentum, in the limit of no
recoil.
