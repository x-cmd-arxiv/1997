macroevolution may give rise to self-organized critical phenomena which could
have a significant effect on the dynamics of ecosystems. In particular it has
been suggested that mass extinction may arise through a purely biotic mechanism
as the result of so-called coevolutionary avalanches. In this paper we first
explore the empirical evidence which has been put forward in favor of this
conclusion. The data center principally around the existence of power-law
functional forms in the distribution of the sizes of extinction events and
other quantities. We then propose a new mathematical model of mass extinction
which does not rely on coevolutionary effects and in which extinction is caused
entirely by the action of environmental stresses on species. In combination
with a simple model of species adaptation we show that this process can account
for all the observed data without the need to invoke coevolution and critical
processes. The model also makes some independent predictions, such as the
existence of ``aftershock'' extinctions in the aftermath of large mass
extinction events, which should in theory be testable against the fossil
record.

multiple 8-13 micron spectra taken from 1994-1995 and N band (10.2 micron)

to a model of the dust distribution around NML Cyg. No spherically symmetric
single dust shell model is found consistent with both near- and mid-infrared
observations. However, a circularly symmetric maximum entropy reconstruction of
the 11 micron brightness distribution suggests a double shell model for the
dust distribution. Such a model, consisting of a geometrically thin shell of
intermediate optical depth ($\tau_{11 micron} \sim 1.9$) plus an outer shell
($\tau_{11 micron} \sim 0.33$), is consistent not only with the 11 micron
visibility data, but also with near-infrared speckle measurements, the
broadband spectrum, and the 9.7 micron silicate feature. The outer shell, or
large scale structure, is revealed only by long-baseline interferometry at 11
micron, being too cold ($\sim$ 400 K) to contribute in the near-infrared and
having no unambiguous spectral signature in the mid-infrared. The optical
constants of Ossenkopf, Henning, & Mathis (1992) proved superior to the Draine
& Lee (1984) constants in fitting the detailed shape of the silicate feature
and broadband spectrum for this object. Recent observations of H$_2$O maser
emission around NML Cyg by Richards, Yates, & Cohen (1996) are consistent with
the location of the two dust shells and provide further evidence for the
two-shell model.

solar p-mode frequencies from low to intermediate degree which allows one to
determine the structure of much of the solar interior avoiding systematic
errors that are introduced when different data sets are combined, i.e.,
principally the effects of solar cycle changes on the frequencies.
Unfortunately, the LOWL data set contains very few of the lowest-degree modes,
which are essential for determining reliably the structure of the solar core -
in addition, these lowest-degree data have fairly large associated
uncertainties. However, observations made by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations
Network (BiSON) in integrated sunlight provide high-accuracy measurements of a
large number of low-degree modes. In this paper we demonstrate that the
low-degree mode set of the LOWL data can be successfully combined with the more
accurate BiSON data, provided the observations are contemporaneous for those
frequencies where the solar-cycle-induced effects are important. We show that
this leads to a factor-of-two decrease in the error on the inferred sound speed
in the solar core. We find that the solar sound speed is higher than in solar
models for r < 0.2Rsun. The density of the solar core is, however, lower than
that in solar models.

about 150 pc and have a face-on covering factor of about 15%. Averaged line
profiles of this component are systematically non-Gaussian with a narrow core
(less than about 6 km/s FWHM) superposed on broad Lorentzian wings (30 km/s
FWHM). An upper limit to the gas temperature of 300 K follows directly from the
narrow line profiles, while simple modeling suggests kinetic temperatures equal
to the peak emission brightness temperature (80-200 K) in all cases but the
outer disks of low mass galaxies, where the HBN becomes optically thin to the
21 cm line. Positive radial gradients in the derived kinetic temperature are
found in all spiral galaxies. The distributions of brightness temperature with

We find no evidence from either dataset to support such a claim, or to confirm
the existence of an ""A-star gap"" in the B-V color range 0.22 <= B-V <= 0.28 due
to the sudden onset of convection. We do observe, nonetheless, a large scatter
in the 1800--2000 A colors of the A-F stars, which amounts to ~0.65 mags at a
given B-V color index. The scatter is not caused by interstellar or
circumstellar reddening. A convincing case can also be made against binarity
and intrinsic variability due to pulsations of delta Sct origin. We find no
correlation with established chromospheric and coronal proxies of convection,
and thus no demonstrable link to the possible onset of convection among the A-F
stars. The scatter is not instrumental. Approximately 0.4 mags of the scatter
is shown to arise from individual differences in surface gravity as well as a
moderate spread (factor of ~3) in heavy metal abundance and UV line blanketing.
A dispersion of ~0.25 mags remains, which has no clear and obvious explanation.
The most likely cause, we believe, is a residual imprecision in our correction
for the spread in metal abundances. However, the existing data do not rule out
possible contributions from intrinsic stellar variability or from differential
UV line blanketing effects owing to a dispersion in microturbulent velocity.

months indicates either activation of the opposite pole of the neutron star if
the magnetic field is asymmetric or possibly a change in the beam pattern, from
a pencil beam to a fan beam. Assuming a fan beam configuration, the pulse
profile is used to find the inclinations of the magnetic axis and the viewing
axis with the spin axis. The derived angles support the GINGA observations of a
dip in the pulse profile which was resolved to have a local maximum in one of

features of the high temperature superconducting cuprates, both in the normal

arising close to this charge-driven quantum critical point gives rise to the
non-Fermi liquid behavior universally found at optimal doping. This interaction
is also responsible for d-wave Cooper pair formation with a superconducting
critical temperature strongly dependent on doping in the overdoped region and
with a plateau in the optimally doped region. In the underdoped region a
temperature dependent pairing potential favors local pair formation without
superconducting coherence, with a peculiar temperature dependence of the

$\alpha>1/m^2$ the LDOS fluctuations (with respect to this average form) are
weak. In the opposite case, $\alpha<1/m^2$, the fluctuations get strong and the
average LDOS ceases to be representative, which is related to the existence of
the Anderson transition at $\alpha_c\sim 1/(m^2\log^2m)$. On the localized side

enhancement of the neutrino magnetic moment was unambiguous, we stressed that
in this effective Lagrangian approach an uncertainty persisted about the

  Rb.sphaeroides as a double triplet","10 pages Latex, 1 figure, to be published in Chemical Physics Letters
  1997",,"10.1016/S0009-2614(97)00172-3",,"physics.chem-ph physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph",,"  The recently observed transient absorption of the lowest excited state of the
special pair P* at 2710 cm-1 is assigned as a singlet which arises from the
coupling of the two lowest triplets from the two dimer halves. INDO
calculations are used to predict its intensity. The analogy of the coupling
mechanism to the trip-doublet spectrum from P+ is shown and the influence of
the double triplet on the Stark effect of P* is investigated.

three-dimensional diagrammatic views of Gyoja's idempotent elements, based
closely on the corresponding Young diagram. In this context we give
straightforward calculations for the eigenvalues of two natural central
elements in the Hecke algebras, namely the full curl and the sum of the Murphy
operators. We discuss their calculation also in terms of the framing factor
associated to the appropriate irreducible representation of the quantum group
SU(N,q).
