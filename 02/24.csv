decoupled from each other. One of them, the tunneling field, produces a first
stage of inflation which prepares the ground for the nucleation of a highly
symmetric bubble. The other, a free field, drives a second period of slow roll
inflation inside the bubble. However, the second field also evolves during the
first stage of inflation, which to some extent breaks the needed symmetry. We
show that this generates large supercurvature anisotropies which, together with
the results of Tanaka and Sasaki, rule out this class of simple models (unless,
of course, $\Omega_0$ is sufficiently close to one.) The problem does not arise
in modified models where the second field does not evolve in the first stage of
inflation.

distance modulus determined from Tully-Fisher by an amount that is proportional
to the galaxy's line width, W: Delta mu ~ (-1.73\pm 0.46)log(W). While a
miscalibration of the slope of Tully-Fisher could in principle produce this
effect, we argue that such a miscalibration is very unlikely. The other
possible explanation is that the inferred Cepheid luminosity is correlated with
the rotation speed v (and hence W) of its parent galaxy: L ~ v^{0.7}. This
proportionality is superposed on the well-established relation between period
and luminosity.) Such a dependence would be expected if Cepheid luminosity is
correlated with metallicity, since galaxies with deeper potential wells tend to
retain more of their metals. It would induce a discrepancy of 0.83 mag between
H_0 determinations that are calibrated using M31 (log W=2.71) and the H_0
determination from SNIa, which is calibrated in galaxies with mean line width
<log W>=2.23. A discrepancy of 0.83 mag corresponds to the difference between
80 km/s/Mpc and 55 km/s/Mpc, very similar to the actual discrepancy reported in
the current literature.

off-center nucleus, the ring extending halfway to the intruder, and the

the existence of the (2p,2q) vector multiplets in the Nf=4 theory. The
corresponding massive theories are studied in parallel, and it is shown that
though in these cases the spectrum is no longer self-dual at a given point on
the moduli space, it is still in perfect agreement with an exact S duality. We
also discuss the interplay between our results and both the semiclassical
quantization and the heterotic-type II string-string duality conjecture.

as an efficient description of the scalar field sector of supergravities in
relation with their non perturbative structure encoded in the U-duality group.
I also review recent results on the construction of BPS saturated states as
solution of the first differential equations following from imposing
preservation of a fraction of the original supersymmetries. In particular I
discuss N=2 extremal black holes that are approximated by a Bertotti Robinson
metric near their horizon. The extension of this construction to maximally
extended supergravities in all dimensions from 4 to 11 is work in progress
where the use of the Solvable Lie algebra approach promises to be of decisive
usefulness.

to include successively all instanton corrections. Expanding these corrections
at particular points in moduli space yields polynomial and logarithmic
instanton corrections to the classical black hole entropy. We comment on a
microscopic interpretation of these instanton corrections and find that the
logarithmic corrections correspond to subleading terms in the degeneracy of the
spectrum of an underlying quantum theory.

Effects of the short-range correlations are studied with the aid of a
perturbation expansion method with various choices of the Jastrow correlation
function. The model is used to investigate the relative importance of the
different reaction mechanisms contributing to the A(e,e$'$pn) and A(e,e$'$pp)
process. Representative examples for the target nuclei $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O
and for kinematical conditions accessible with contemporary high-duty cycle
electron accelerators are presented. A procedure is outlined to calculate the
two-nucleon knockout contribution to the semi-exclusive (e,e$'$p) cross
section. Using this technique we investigate in how far semi-exclusive
(e,e$'$p) reactions can be used to detect high-momentum components in the
nuclear spectral function.

these spaces are described from a unified setting following a Cayley-Klein
scheme allowing to simultaneously study the main features of their Riemannian,
pesudoRiemannian and semiRiemannian metrics, as well as of their curvatures.
Some of the rank-one spaces are naturally interpreted as spacetime models.
Likewise, the same natural interpretation for rank-two spaces is as spaces of
lines in rank-one spaces; through this relation these rank-two spaces give rise
to homogeneous phase space models. The main features of the phase spaces for
homogeneous spacetimes are analysed.

real quasi-simple Lie algebras of orthogonal type, for arbitrary dimension, is
obtained in a unified setting. The results simultaneously include the well
known polynomial invariants of the pseudo-orthogonal algebras $so(p,q)$, as
well as the Casimirs for many non-simple algebras such as the inhomogeneous
$iso(p,q)$, the Newton-Hooke and Galilei type, etc., which are obtained by
contraction(s) starting from the simple algebras $so(p,q)$. The dimension of
the center of the enveloping algebra of a quasi-simple orthogonal algebra turns
out to be the same as for the simple $so(p,q)$ algebras from which they come by
contraction. The structure of the higher order invariants is given in a
convenient ""pyramidal"" manner, in terms of certain sets of ""Pauli-Lubanski""
elements in the enveloping algebras. As an example showing this approach at
work, the scheme is applied to recovering the Casimirs for the (3+1)
kinematical algebras. Some prospects on the relevance of these results for the
study of expansions are also given.
