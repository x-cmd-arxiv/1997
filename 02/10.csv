increased by only a modest factor and no dramatic increase in the optical depth

high magnifications is significantly increased due to the inclusion of a disk,
especially for nearly edge-on configurations; due to the strong observational
selection effects favoring high magnifications, there might be significant
consequences for lensing statistics.

produced by a hydrodynamic simulation of a spatially flat CDM universe with a
non-zero cosmological constant ($\Omega_0=0.4$, $\Lambda_0=0.6$, $\sigma_8

size from several kiloparsecs to about a hundred kiloparsecs in proper units,
and they range in shape from roundish, high column density regions with
$\nhi\ge 10^{15} cm^{-2}$ to low column density sheet-like structures with
$\nhi \le 10^{13} cm^{-2}$ at z=3. The most common shape found in the
simulation resembles that of a flattened cigar. The physical size of a typical
cloud grows with time roughly as $(1+z)^{-3/2}$ while its shape hardly evolves
(except for the most dense regions $\rho_{cut}>30$). Our result indicates that
any simple model with a population of spheres (or other shapes) of a uniform
size is oversimplified; if such a model agrees with observational evidence, it
is probably only by coincidence. We also illustrate why the use of double
quasar sightlines to set lower limits on cloud sizes is useful only when the
perpendicular sightline separation is small ($\Delta r \le 50h^{-1}$ kpc).
Finally, we conjecture that high column density $\lya$ clouds ($\nhi\ge 10^{15}
cm^{-2}$) may be the progenitors of the lower redshift faint blue galaxies.
This seems plausible because their correlation length, number density
(extrapolated to lower redshift) and their masses are in fair agreement with
those observed.

leads to tight constraints on the density parameter; 0.25<Omega_0<0.4
(0.4<Omega_0<0.5) for flat (open) models. The upper limits on Omega_0 can be
relaxed if one lowers the H_0 and increases the age of the universe, but h<0.25
is required to allow Omega_0=1. The constraints also change if one allows
tilted primordial power spectra. An acceptable Omega_0=1 model with h=0.5 can
be constructed, with a tilt of n=0.8. We compare the evolved mass correlation
functions of the most promising models with those of APM galaxies. The flat
models have steep correlation functions at small scales and require galaxies to
be antibiased on scales r<8 Mpc/h. The open models require little or no
antibias on small scales and a positive bias on large scales. The lack of a
positive bias on small scales is difficult to reconcile with the virial
analysis of galaxy clusters which, if Omega_0>0.2, implies that galaxies are
overabundant in clusters relative to the field. The tilted Omega_0=1 model, on
the other hand, does require that galaxies be positively biased on all scales.
We also compute the topology of isodensity contours in these models, obtaining

find that the distribution of field ab-type RR Lyrae stars in the
period-metallicity plane can be easily understood within the framework of the

affects field variables. Theoretical predictions concerning the

find a general agreement for metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.4) RR Lyrae stars, whereas
more metal-rich variables show amplitudes smaller than those predicted for
pulsators originated from old, low-mass evolving stars. Alternatively, the
agreement between theory and observations would require that a substantial
fraction of metal-rich RR Lyrae variables in the Galactic field were younger
than approximately 2 Gyr. The comparison between the pulsational behavior of RR
Lyrae either in the Galactic field or in the Galactic bulge discloses the

collisional Boltzmann equation corresponding to $\rho \sim r^{-4/3}$. This
equilibrium is both stable and an attractor. It is the natural end-point of the
diffusive encounters of an ensemble of equal mass clumps. The introduction of a
mass spectrum weakens the mass density cusp. The spike in the luminosity
density can be accentuated or softened, depending on the form of the
mass-luminosity relation. Possible applications to the cusped nuclei of

displacement moments, and modelled by an interacting scalar field theory. This

interaction with the larger environment of cosmic medium. In this lecture we
first review some recent developments of the theory of quantum dissipation in
the linear open system. In the second part we discuss two classes of
applications: decay of unstable particle in medium, and environmental effect on
the parametric particle production. The first subject of particle decay may
have important consequences on the scenario of baryogenesis due to a GUT heavy
particle. On the other hand, the parametric resonant particle production is
related to the reheating problem after inflation, and its environmental effect
is related also, perhaps more importantly, to the decay of moduli fields in
supergravity models.

a scale which can be taken to be the string unification scale $M_{s}\sim

acceptably small masses through a see-saw mechanism. Coloured triplets that
couple to matter fields are naturally split from the coexisting isodoublets
without the need of any numerical fine tuning.
