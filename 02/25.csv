  Vol. 484, July 20, 1997",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent results from the ROSAT All Sky Survey, and from deep ROSAT pointings
reveal that broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs) are weak in the soft X-ray
bandpass (with optical-to-X-ray spectral slope alpha_{ox}>1.8) in comparison to
QSOs with normal OUV spectra (mean alpha_{ox}=1.4). One glaring exception
appeared to be the nearby BALQSO PG1416-129, which is a bright ROSAT source
showing no evidence for intrinsic soft X-ray absorption. We present here our
new HST FOS spectrum of PG1416-129, in which we find no evidence for BALs. We
show that the features resulting in the original BAL classification, based on
IUE spectra, were probably spurious. On the basis of UV, X-ray and optical
evidence, we conclude that PG1416-129, is not now, and has never been a BALQSO.
Our result suggests that weak soft X-ray emission is a defining characteristic
of true BALQSOs. If BALQSOs indeed harbor normal intrinsic spectral energy
distributions, their observed soft X-ray weakness is most likely the result of
absorption. The ubiquitous occurrence of weak soft X-ray emission with UV
absorption (BALs) thus suggests absorbers in each energy regime that are
physically associated, if not identical.

most of the central 10 pc of this source is not significantly affected by
free-free absorption, even though HST images show that the nucleus contains a
nearly edge-on disk of gas and dust on larger scales. Our highest angular
resolution image shows a very narrow gap in emission, which we interpret as an
absorption feature, just east of the radio core. This suggests that there may
be a small, dense inner accretion disk whose width is less than 0.1 pc. If the
inclination of this inner disk is close to that of the larger-scale HST disk it
becomes optically thin to 8.4 GHz radiation at a deprojected radius of about
0.8 pc. The brightness of the pc-scale jets falls off very rapidly on both
sides of the core, suggesting that the jets are rapidly expanding during the
the first several pc of their travel. It appears that there is a small dense
inner disk centered on the radio core (the base of the jets; less than 1 pc), a
low density bubble filling most of the the inner several pc of the nucleus

of statistical isotropy in characteristic patterns determined by the photon
geodesic structure of the manifold and [2] an infrared cutoff in the power
spectrum of perturbations imposed by the finite spatial extent. To make a

computation of the pixel-pixel temperature correlation function for each

general technique using the method of images for doing this in compact

hole candidate Cygnus X-1, detected for the first time in the ASCA observation
of May 9th., 1995. During this observation, particularly deep dipping took
place resulting in strong changes in hardness ratio corresponding to absorption
of the power law spectral component. The deadtime corrected light curve with
high time resolution clearly shows a dramatic decrease in the extent of
flickering in the band 0.7 - 4.0 keV during dipping, but in the band 4.0 - 10.0
keV, there is relatively little change. We show that the rms flickering
amplitude in the band 0.7 - 4.0 keV is proportional to the X-ray intensity in
this band which changes by a factor of almost three. This is direct evidence
that the strong Low State flickering is intrinsic to the power law emission; ie
takes place as part of the emission process. The rms amplitude is proportional
to the intensity in the low energy band, except for a possible deviation from
linearity at the lower intensities. If confirmed, this non-linearity could
imply a process such as electron scattering of radiation which will tend to
smear out the fluctuations, or a process of fluctuation generation which
depends on radial position in the source. Thus timing observations during
absorption dips can give information about the source region and may place
constraints on its size.

settling dissipatively at the centres of dark halos to form galaxies. The
evolution of the dark matter component has been studied extensively by N-body
simulations. The abundances, density profiles, shape and angular momentum
distributions and the formation histories of the dark halo population can all
be predicted reliably for any hierarchical cosmogony. The systematic variation
of these properties with halo mass can produce scaling relations in the galaxy
population. Simple hypotheses for how galaxies condense within dark halos lead
to characteristic luminosities, sizes, and spins which are close to those of
real spiral and elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, correlations similar to the
Tully-Fisher, Faber-Jackson and luminosity-metallicity relations arise quite
naturally. A quantitative explanation of the fundamental plane of elliptical

splitting $Y=R\times M$ of the coordinate bundle $Y\to R$. From physical

Obviously, such a splitting is broken under reference frame transformations and
time-dependent canonical transformations. Our goal is to formulate
time-dependent mechanics in gauge-invariant form, i.e., independently of any
reference frame. The main ingredient in this formulation is a connection on the

following peculiarities of this approach to time-dependent mechanics. A phase
space does not admit any canonical contact or presymplectic structure which
would be preserved under reference frame transformations, whereas the canonical
Poisson structure is degenerate. A Hamiltonian fails to be a function on a
phase space. In particular, it can not participate in a Poisson bracket so that
the evolution equation is not reduced to the Poisson bracket. This fact becomes
relevant to the quantization procedure. Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations

D 56, 2100 (1997)","10.1103/PhysRevD.56.2100","TUTP-97-06","gr-qc",,"  The ``warp drive'' metric recently presented by Alcubierre has the problem
that an observer at the center of the warp bubble is causally separated from
the outer edge of the bubble wall. Hence such an observer can neither create a
warp bubble on demand nor control one once it has been created. In addition,
such a bubble requires negative energy densities. One might hope that
elimination of the first problem might ameliorate the second as well. We
analyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two
spacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a
consequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that although
the time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for
a round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In
our four dimensional extension of this metric, a ``tube'' is constructed along
the path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the star.
Inside the tube spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to
allow superluminal travel in one direction. We show that, although a single
Krasnikov tube does not involve closed timelike curves, a time machine can be
constructed with a system of two non-overlapping tubes. Furthermore, it is
demonstrated that Krasnikov tubes, like warp bubbles and traversable wormholes,
also involve unphysically thin layers of negative energy density, as well as
large total negative energies, and therefore probably cannot be realized in
practice.

searches for gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars, using archived
data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. These

accumulaton of signal-to-noise using Fourier transforms of long stretches of
data (months to years). Earth-motion-induced Doppler shifts, and intrinsic
pulsar spindown, will reduce the narrow-band signal-to-noise by spreading power
across many frequency bins; therefore, it is necessary to correct for these
effects before performing the Fourier transform. The corrections can be
implemented by a parametrized model, in which one does a search over a discrete
set of parameter values. We define a metric on this parameter space, which can
be used to determine the optimal spacing between points in a search; the metric
is used to compute the number of independent parameter-space points Np that
must be searched, as a function of observation time T. The number Np(T) depends
on the maximum gravitational wave frequency and the minimum spindown age
tau=f/(df/dt) that the search can detect. The signal-to-noise ratio required,
in order to have 99% confidence of a detection, also depends on Np(T). We find
that for an all-sky, all-frequency search lasting T=10^7 s, this detection
threshhold is at a level of 4 to 5 times h(3/yr), where h(3/yr) is the
corresponding 99% confidence threshhold if one knows in advance the pulsar

opening the window for electroweak baryogenesis in the MSSM. For the

four known forces in the standard model with an alternative Weyl description in
which the chiral coupling is extended to include gravity. The two are
indistinguishable at the low energy classical level of equations of motion, but
there are subtle differences at the quantum level when nonvanishing torsion and
the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly is taken into account. The spin current and
energy-momentum of the chiral theory then contain non-Hermitian terms which are
not present in the conventional theory. In the chiral alternative, CPT
invariance is not automatic because chirality supersedes Hermiticity but full
Lorentz invariance holds. New fermion loop processes associated with the theory
are discussed together with a perturbative regularization which explicitly
maintains the chiral nature and local symmetries of the theory.

describing a sector of matter above some critical distance scale, several
sectors of matter with different critical speeds in vacuum can coexist and an
absolute rest frame (the vacuum rest frame, possibly related to the local rest
frame of the expanding Universe) may exist without contradicting the apparent
Lorentz invariance felt by ""ordinary"" particles (particles with critical speed
in vacuum equal to c , the speed of light). The real geometry of space-time
will then be different from standard Lorentz invariance, and the Poincare
relativity principle will be a local (in space and time), approximate sectorial
property. It seems natural to assume that particles with critical speed in
vacuum different from c are superluminal. We illustrate such a scenario using
as an example a spinorial space-time where the modulus of the spinor,
associated to the time variable, is the size of an expanding Universe. Several
properties of superluminal particles, and of matter without a universal
relativity principle, are discussed in view of experimental applications. If
the vacuum rest frame is close to that suggested by the cosmic microwave
background, experimental searches for superluminal particles on earth should
mainly contemplate a laboratory speed range around 10E3 c , even for very high
energy superluminal cosmic rays. The detectability of several consequences of
the new scenario is briefly discussed.
