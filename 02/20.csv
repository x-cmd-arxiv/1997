one source, L1157, has a red asymmetry in HCO+ J=4-3 and a blue asymmetry in

sources with an interesting line asymmetry were mapped. A Monte Carlo code was
used to produce an evolutionary sequence of collapsing cloud models of the HCO+

evidence is needed to establish that infall is taking place. The HCO+ spectra
are not conclusive because bipolar outflows produce strong emission, which can
confuse the issue in any individual source. However, the predominance of blue

energy in a spherical box in the Schwarzschild spacetime. Quasilocal energy is
the value of the Hamiltonian that generates unit magnitude proper-time
translations on the box orthogonal to the spatial hypersurfaces foliating the
Schwarzschild spacetime. We call this Hamiltonian the Brown-York Hamiltonian.
We find different classes of foliations that correspond to time-evolution by
the Brown-York Hamiltonian. We show that although the Brown-York expression for
the quasilocal energy is correct, one needs to supplement their derivation with
an extra set of boundary conditions on the interior end of the spatial
hypersurfaces inside the hole in order to obtain it from an action principle.
Replacing this set of boundary conditions with another set yields the
Louko-Whiting Hamiltonian, which corresponds to time-evolution of spatial
hypersurfaces in a different foliation of the Schwarzschild spacetime. We argue
that in the thermodynamical picture, the Brown-York Hamiltonian corresponds to
the internal energy whereas the Louko-Whiting Hamiltonian corresponds to the
Helmholtz free energy of the system. Unlike what has been the usual route to
black hole thermodynamics in the past, this observation immediately allows us
to obtain the partition function of such a system without resorting to any kind
of Euclideanization of either the Hamiltonian or the action. In the process, we
obtain some interesting insights into the geometrical nature of black hole
thermodynamics.

supersymmetry as the near-term future of high energy physics as a natural
science. I then attempt, as requested, some more `visionary' - i.e. even lower
resolution - comments about the farther future. In that spirit, I emphasize the
continuing importance of condensed matter physics as a source of inspiration
and potential application, in particular for expansion of symmetry concepts,
and of cosmology as a source of problems, applications, and perhaps ultimately
limitations.

that this approach is consistent with the concept of diffractive parton

through integrals of non-Abelian eikonal factors in the fundamental and adjoint
representation respectively. As a by-product, previously calculated diffractive
cross sections for processes with a final state gluon are rederived in a
simpler way.
