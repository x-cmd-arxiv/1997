source X 1755-338. These results are consistent with the two-component model
that we previously proposed consisting of a blackbody point source plus an
extended power law component. Remarkably, the low energy cut-off of the
spectrum does not change appreciably in dips, and it can be seen that dipping
takes place in the higher part of the PSPC band where the blackbody contributes
to the spectrum. Thus dipping consists primarily of absorption of this
component, whereas the low energy cut-off is determined by the power law. Thus,
above 0.5 keV, the dipping is approximately independent of energy as seen in
Exosat and 10 +/- 0.4% deep. Below 0.5 keV, there may be a small residual
dipping effect of up to 3%; however dipping is certainly substantially reduced
compared with the 20% seen by Exosat, and this is the first time that the
effective cessation of dipping at low energies in such sources has been seen.

  Accepted for publication in the Apr. 97 AJ",,"10.1086/118342",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the results of the first imaging X-ray observations in the
0.4-10.0 keV bandpass of the nearby starburst galaxies M82 and NGC 253. The
ASCA spectra of both M82 and NGC 253 are complex with strong line emission from
O, Ne, Fe, Mg, S, and Si, allowing elemental abundances to be estimated in the
X-ray band for the first time in these sources. Two components are required to
fit the spectra of both galaxies, with a ""soft"" component well described by a
thermal model with a temperature of ~ 10^6-7 K and a ""hard"" component well
described by either a thermal model (T ~ 10^8 K) or a power-law model (energy
index ~ 0.8-1.0). We find that different models (with different continua) yield
absolute abundances that differ by more than an order of magnitude, while
relative abundances are more robust and suggest an underabundance of Fe
(inferred from the Fe-L complex) relative to alpha-burning elements, possibly
as a result of dust depletion. Most of the soft flux (which originates mostly
within the central kpc of M82 and NGC 253) is consistent with starburst models
of supernovae-heated ISM and, to a lesser extent, starburst-driven superwind
emission and the direct emission from supernova (SN). The hard component in
both galaxies may have some contribution from ~ 10^8 K superwind emission or
individual SN, although most of the emission probably originates in point
sources (most likely blackhole candidates or mini-AGN with M_Edd > 3-20 solar
masses) and, possibly, inverse-Compton scattering of IR photons. The similarity
of the spectral X-ray characteristics of NGC 253 and M82 to some LINERs and
low-luminosity AGN suggests a link between AGN and starbursts (e.g., both may
contain an accretion-driven emission component).

these three unusual objects suggest a trend of increasing radio luminosity with
the amount of absorption to the quasar, and are perhaps transition objects
between radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. The two new objects are from a

attenuated at optical wavelengths in the observed frame. These objects would be
easily overlooked by most optical QSO searches; their abundance in the radio

at high precision analysis of the galaxy distribution. They form a symmetric
matrix, $Q_{NM}$, related to moment correlators the same way as cumulants are
related to the moments of the distribution. They encode more information than
the usual cumulants, $S_N$'s, and their extraction from data is similar to the
calculation of the two-point correlation function. Perturbation theory (PT),
its generalization, the extended perturbation theory (EPT), and the
hierarchical assumption (HA) have simple predictions for these statistics. As
an example, the factorial moment correlators measured by Szapudi, Dalton,
Efstathiou & Szalay (1996) in the APM catalog are reanalyzed using this
technique. While the previous analysis assumed hierarchical structure
constants, this method can directly investigate the validity of HA, along with
PT, and EPT. The results in agreement with previous findings indicate that, at
the small scales used for this analysis, the APM data supports HA. When all
non-linear corrections are taken into account it is a good approximation at the
20 percent level. It appears that PT, and a natural generalization of EPT for
cumulant correlators does not provide such a good fit for the APM at small
scales. Once the validity the HA is approximately established, cumulant
correlators can separate the amplitudes of different tree-types in the
hierarchy up to fifth order. As an example, the weights for the fourth order
tree topologies are calculated including all non-linear corrections.

model we apply the resulting in-medium rho spectral function to compute
$e^+e^-$ production rates from $\pi^+\pi^-$ annihilation. The calculation of
corresponding $e^+e^-$ spectra as recently measured in central collisions of
heavy-ions at CERN/SpS energies gives reasonable agreement with the

by S. Brodsky, C. Munger and I. Schmidt, and which furthermore predicted
exactly the number of atoms that were detected for the particular conditions of
the experiment. The study of antihydrogen affords science the opportunity to
continue research on the symmetry between matter and antimatter. In this talk
the importance of antihydrogen as a basic physical system is discussed.
Different production methods that have been tried in the past are briefly
presented, and the method that was used in the CERN experiment is analyzed in
detail. It consists in producing antihydrogen by circulating a beam of an
antiproton ring through an internal gas target. In the Coulomb field of a
nucleus, an electron-positron pair is created, and antihydrogen will form when
the positron is created in a bound rather that a continuum state about the
antiproton. The theoretical calculation of the production cross section is
presented in detail. A discussion of the detection systems used both in the
CERN experiment and in another similar experiment that is right now underway at
Fermilab are also given. Finally I present and discuss possible future
experiments using antihydrogen, including the measurement of the antihydrogen
Lamb shift.

This is explicitly shown to be true for the case of two arcs, apart from the

equation for the complex matrix model with multiple arcs, which provides all
multi-loop correlators up to an arbitrary genus. Explicit results for genus one

symmetry. By taking a different infinite coupling limit, one can recover the
E_8 x E_8 gauge bosons of M-theory, compactified on S^1/Z_2. In this paper we
use the matrix model description of the D-particle dynamics to study these

the Dynamical Casimir Effect. The key essence of this effect is the change in
zero-point energy associated with any change in a dielectric medium. (In
particular, if the change in the dielectric medium is taken to be the growth or
collapse of a bubble, this effect may have relevance to sonoluminescence.) The
kernel of Schwinger's result is that the change in Casimir energy is
proportional to the change in volume of the dielectric, plus finite-volume
corrections. Other papers have called into question this result, claiming that
the volume term should actually be discarded, and that the dominant term
remaining is proportional to the surface area of the dielectric. In this
communication, which is an expansion of an earlier letter on the same topic, we
present a careful and critical review of the relevant analyses. We find that
the Casimir energy, defined as the change in zero-point energy due to a change
in the medium, has at leading order a bulk volume dependence. This is in full
agreement with Schwinger's result, once the correct physical question is asked.
We have nothing new to say about sonoluminescence itself.

emergence of stable, macroscopic quantum coherent states, identifiable with the
``preconscious states''. Quantum space-time effects, as described by
non-critical string theory, trigger then an ``organized collapse'' of the
coherent states down to a specific or ``conscious state''. The whole process we
estimate to take O(1 sec), in excellent agreement with a plethora of
experimental/observational findings. The complete integrability of the stringy
model for MT proves sufficient in providing a satisfactory solution to memory
coding and capacity. Such features might turn out to be important for a model
of the brain as a quantum computer.
