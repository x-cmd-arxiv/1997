the change in distribution function of the stellar mass production rate in
individual galaxies with redshift. The evolution of the star formation rate
distribution with redshift is interpreted in terms of the history of spiral
galaxy formation, with the disk component modelled as a single evolving entity,
and the characteristic timescales, luminosities, and epochs varying according
to galaxy type. The more massive forming galaxies seen at z=1 to 3 are
identified as earlier type spirals, whose star formation rates are initially
high and then decline rapidly at z<1, while for later type spirals and smaller
mass irregulars the mass formation rates at z<1 are lower, and the formation
process persists to redshifts much closer to the present epoch. We find that
these models can be consistent with the data and fit well into a broad picture
of other recent results if qnought=0.02 and many of the disks begin their
growth at z<<3, but that they predict too many bright star formers at high z in
flat universes.

described by means of a Poissonian ensemble. We focus on the case of only few

which the distorted system differs from a chaotic system (described by a
Gaussian ensemble): 1. The width distribution for large coupling becomes
broader than the corresponding $\chi^2_K$ distribution in the GOE case. 2. Due
to the coupling to the continuum, correlations are induced not only between the
positions of the resonances but also between positions and widths. These
correlations remain even in the strong coupling limit. In order to explain
these results, an asymptotic expression for the width distribution is derived
for the one channel case. It relates the width of a trapped resonance state to
the distance between its two neighboring levels.

are at least 3 different proposals for the dependence of $\lambda_2$ on

Shepelyansky's original approach neglected the phase correlations inherent in
the interference phenomena of localization and thus appears at least
questionable. In our Letter, we avoided this problem. Our results based on the
transfer matrix method (TMM) led us to ``conclude that the TMM ... measures an

particular, we did not question the results of v. Oppen et al. reproduced in
the Comment. We also note that in our Letter we explored the limit of large
system size M and not the ``thermodynamic limit''. The latter implies of course
a finite particle density quite different from the TIP problem. In any case,
$\lambda_2$ does not correspond to ``extended states'', because it remains
finite and smaller than M. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
``scaling theory of localization'' for TIP.

ternary mixtures a quantitative comparison with critical Casimir and van der

tricritical Casimir force is considerably stronger than the critical one and
dominates also the competing van der Waals force.

representing the intersection of parallel 3-branes with 5-branes whose
orientations are determined by their $Sl(2;\bZ)$ charge vectors. These IIB
solutions, which generically preserve 3/16 of the supersymmetry, can be further
mapped to solutions of D=11 supergravity representing the intersection of
parallel membranes with any number of fivebranes at arbitrary angles.
Alternatively, a subclass (corresponding to non-singular D=11 solutions) can be
mapped to solutions representing the intersection on a string of any number of
D-5-branes at arbitrary angles, again preserving 3/16 supersymmetry, as we
verify in a special case by a quaternionic extension of the analysis of
Berkooz, Douglas and Leigh. We also use similar methods to find new 1/8
supersymmetric solutions of orthogonally intersecting branes.

charges is obtained most directly when a correct separation between
gauge-invariant and gauge degrees of freedom is made. This motivates a similar
separation in the nonabelian theory. When a careful identification of the
Hilbert space is made, along with the proper analyticity requirements, it is
then possible to find the appropriate wavefunctionals describing heavy color
sources in the theory. This treatment is consistent with, and realizes in a
simple way the center symmetry Z_N of SU(N) gauge theories.

marginally bound (orthogonally) intersecting configurations of two p-branes
(e.g, two four-branes of Type II string theory), performing a boost
transformation at an angle with respect to the world-volume of the
configuration, performing T-duality transformation along the boost-direction,
S-duality transformation, and T- transformations along the direction
perpendicular to the boost transformation. The resulting configuration is
non-marginally bound BPS-saturated solution whose static metric possesses the
off-diagonal term which cannot be removed by a coordinate transformation, and
thus signifies an angle (different from pi/2) between the resulting
intersecting p-branes. Additional new p-branes are bound to this configuration,
in order to ensure the stability of such a static, tilted configuration.

connectedness via singular limits is greatly simplified by using polytopes that
are maximal with respect to certain single or multiple weight systems. We

sharp slope discontinuity at N=Z. This cusp (Wigner energy), reflecting an
additional binding in nuclei with neutrons and protons occupying the same shell
model orbitals, is usually attributed to neutron-proton pairing correlations. A
method is developed to extract the Wigner term from experimental data. Both
empirical arguments and shell-model calculations suggest that the Wigner term
can be traced back to the isospin T=0 part of nuclear interaction. Our
calculations reveal the rather complex mechanism responsible for the nuclear
binding around the N=Z line. In particular, we find that the Wigner term cannot
be solely explained in terms of correlations between the neutron-proton J=1,
T=0 (deuteron-like) pairs.

corresponding B(E2) transition probabilities is investigated within a broad
range of SU(3) irreducible representations $(\lambda,\mu)$. The calculations
show that the $(\lambda,\mu)$ characteristics of rotational nuclei depend to a
great extent on the magnitude of the SU(3) splitting between the ground and
$\gamma$ bands. It is found that for weakly split spectra, the ground--$\gamma$
band coupling scheme is realized relevantly within narrow regions of
``favored'' $(\lambda,\mu)$ multiplets, while in the cases of strong splitting
a description in which the ground band is situated alone in an irreducible
representation is favored. The obtained results are analyzed in terms of the
bandmixing interactions. The possibility for a transition between the different
collective SU(3) schemes is discussed.
