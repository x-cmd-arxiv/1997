accelerated protons on UV light is the source of the highest energy photons, in

high-dispersion, long-slit echelle data of the HR Car nebula, and confirmed
that it is a bipolar nebula. Its polar axis lies along the position angle of
125 +- 5 degree; each lobe has, at a distance of 5 kpc a diameter of about 0.65
pc and a line-of-sight expansion velocity of 75-150 km/sec. Beside the
expanding bipolar lobes, a number of [NII]-bright knots are detected. These
knots have lower expansion velocities than the lobes and are detected only
within the projected boundary of the lobes. These knots are most likely
nitrogen-enriched material ejected by HR Car. On a larger scale, a
funnel-shaped nebula is detected at 2.5"" northwest of HR Car. The axis of the
funnel is roughly aligned with the polar axis of the HR Car nebula, suggesting
that HR Car may be responsible for the ionization and shaping of this nebula.
Future observations of kinematics and abundances are needed to determine the
nature of this nebula. We propose that the bipolar nebula of HR Car is a more
evolved version of the Homunculus Nebula around eta Car. The recently developed
theory of wind-compressed disks may explain the higher density of the
equatorial plane and the formation of bipolar nebulae of LBVs.

the framework of the MSSM. These higher order contributions to the top width
are compared with the direct top decays into 2 and 3 real SUSY particles. It
turns out that whereas the SUSY effects on t-> W^+ b add up to those from
standard QCD, they tend most likely to erase the conventional QCD corrections
to t-> H+ b. However, in the latter case the full (strong plus electroweak)
SUSY quantum effects are generally so large that the QCD corrections
effectively come out with the ``wrong sign''. A qualitatively distinct, and
quantitatively significant, ``quantum signature'' of that type might constitute
a most sought-after imprint of ``virtual'' Supersymmetry, which remains
sizeable enough even in the absence of any direct top decay into SUSY
particles. Similar considerations are made for the hadronic partial widths of
the Higgs bosons of the MSSM. While a first valuable test of these effects
could possibly be performed at the upgraded Tevatron, a more precise
verification would most probably be carried out in future experiments at the
LHC.
