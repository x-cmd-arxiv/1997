two blazars suggest the optical through X-ray continuum is synchrotron emission
from an inhomogeneous jet. The gamma-rays are likely due to Compton scattering
of lower energy photons, either from within the jet or from the surrounding

still largely a mystery but are probably related in some way to accretion onto

It is shown from a computation of the line velocities and widths that the

found in BY Cam is presented. Additional periods are revealed from a
re-analysis of previous optical polarimetric and UV spectroscopic data. We show
that because of the slight asynchronism between the white dwarf rotation and
the orbital period, significant changes in the accretion geometry introduce a

Large phase variations are shown to exist which are well reproduced by a
phase-drift model in which a magnetic dipole rotates in the orbital frame with

common for ground-based experiments in which an important fraction of the noise

paper considers the Tenerife experiments (three radiometers at 10, 15 and 33

taking into account properly in the more recent analysis of these data. It will
be demonstrated that for each of the three radiometers of these experiments,
the atmospheric noise is equivalent to a Gaussian noise common to both channels
with a coherence time smaller than the binning time, the net effect being an
enhancement of the error-bars in the stacked scan as compared with the
estimation for the case of pure uncorrelated noise. As expected from the

stars in the galactic halo. In this model, bursters are born in the galactic
disk with large recoil velocities V_r, and GRBs are beamed to within emission
cones of half-angle \phi centered on V_r. We describe scenarios for
magnetically -channeled GRBs that have such beaming characteristics. We then
make detailed comparisons of this halo beaming model (HBM) to BATSE and PVO
data for GRB intensity & angular position distributions. Acceptable fits to
observations of over 1000 bursts are obtained for \phi = 15 - 30 degrees and
for a BATSE sampling depth ~ 180 kpc. Present data favor a truly isotropic
(cosmological) model over the HBM, but not by a statistically compelling
margin. Bursters born in nearby external galaxies, such as M31, are almost
entirely undetectable in the HBM because of misdirected beaming. We analyze
several refinements of the basic HBM: gamma-ray intensities that vary with
angle from the beam axis; non-standard-candle GRB luminosity functions; and
models including a subset of bursters that do not escape from the galaxy. We
also discuss the energy budgets for the bursters, the origins of their recoils,
and the physics of burst beaming and alignment. One possible physical model is
based on the magnetar model of soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). Empirical bounds on
the rate of formation and peculiar velocities of SGRs imply that there exist ~
10^4 to ~ 10^7 aged SGRs in the galactic halo within a distance of 100 kpc. The
HBM gives an acceptable fit to observations only if it satisfies certain
conditions (e.g. \phi ~ 20 deg) which are possible, but for which there exist
no clear & compelling theoretical justifications. The cosmological burster
hypothesis is more generic and thus more attractive in this sense. (Abbreviated

than the clustering in velocity on corresponding scales along single
sightlines, assuming that the relative velocity of absorbers is dominated by
the Hubble flow. This indicates that small-scale clustering (200 km/s < Delta v
< 600 km/s) of the C IV absorbers cannot be interpreted in terms of the
positions of the absorbers in space, but must be considered as internal motions
within individual absorbers, or within clusters of absorbers whose internal
velocities dominate over Hubble expansion across the cluster scale. If the
single- sightline signal is due to spatial clustering, it is caused by absorber
clusters smaller than would be implied by their velocities if a Hubble flow is
assumed. The spatial clustering of C IV absorbers at z ~ 2 is consistent with
data on Ly alpha forest clustering measured in the same way at the same
redshifts. However, present-day galaxy clustering, evolved back to z ~ 2, is
consistent with C IV spatial clustering but perhaps not with that of the Ly
alpha forest. Even so, one cannot as yet distinguish the two absorber

and provide a qualitatively different view of the nature of the absorbers. The
pair samples a scale critical in determining the size upper bound of Ly alpha
absorbers, with significant leverage in redshift compared to previous studies.
The triplet data represents the spatially densest sample of Ly alpha forest
ever studied, and an almost ideally-suited probe of the shape of absorbers. We
observe a significant number of Ly alpha lines in common between the triplet
sightlines, for lines stronger than rest equivalent width W > 0.4A (and no
detected metal lines) and velocity differences up to 200 km/s, corresponding to
a two-point correlation function xi = 1.88 +0.78/-0.50 on scales 0.5 to 0.8

0.4A Ly alpha forest absorbers span all three sightlines to the triplet,
indicating that the strong-lined absorbers are consistent with nearly round
shapes, chosen from a range of possible cylinders of different elongations.
This may be inconsistent with results from hydrodynamic/gravitational
simulations of H I in the early Universe indicating that the theoretical
counterparts of Ly alpha forest clouds are long and filamentary. We conclude,
tentatively, that the W > 0.4A Ly alpha forest objects are sheetlike. This is
supported by the uniformity of linestrengths between the three sightlines, for
W > 0.4A. (Abstract continues.)

picture of the ionisation in the interiors of quiescent warm opaque
interstellar clouds and in the intercloud medium (ICM) outside dense HII
regions and hot dilute bubbles. Our main conclusion is that within $\sim$ 1kpc
of the sun the ionisation rate of hydrogen per unit volume in both the
interiors of such clouds and in the ICM is independent of the local density of
neutral hydrogen, and varies with position by less than $\sim$ 20 per cent.
These conclusions strongly favour the decaying neutrino hypothesis for the
ionisation of the interstellar medium in these regions.
  Our analysis is based on a variety of observations, of which the most
remarkable is the discovery by Spitzer and Fitzpatrick (1993) that, in the four
slowly moving clouds along the line of sight to the halo star HD93521, the
column densities of both SII and CII$^*$, which individually range over a
factor $\sim$4, are proportional to the column density of HI to within $\sim$20
per cent. This proportionality is used to show that the free electrons exciting
the CII to CII$^*$ are located mainly in the interiors of the clouds, rather
than in their skins, despite the large opacity of the clouds to Lyman continuum
radiation. The same conclusion also follows more unambiguously from the low
value of the H$\alpha$ flux in this direction which was found by Reynolds
(1996) in unpublished observations.
  These results are then used, in conjunction with observations of three pulsar
parallaxes and dispersion measures, and with data on HeI, NII and OI line
emissions, to constrain the ionisation of H, He, N and O and the flux of Lyman
continuum photons from O stars in the ICM.

context of many-body theories. It is based on enforcing conservation laws, the
Pauli principle and a number of crucial sum-rules. More specifically, spin and
charge susceptibilities are expressed, in a conserving approximation, as a
function of two constant irreducible vertices whose values are found
self-consistently. The Mermin-Wagner theorem in two dimensions is automatically
satisfied. The effect of collective modes on single-particle properties is then
obtained by a paramagnon-like formula that is consistent with the two-particle
properties in the sense that the potential energy obtained from $Tr\Sigma G$ is
identical to that obtained using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for
susceptibilities. The vertex corrections are included through constant
irreducible vertices. The theory is in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo
simulations for both single-particle and two-particle properties. In the
two-dimensional renormalized classical regime, spin fluctuations lead to
precursors of antiferromagnetic bands (shadow bands) and to the destruction of
the Fermi-liquid quasiparticles in a wide temperature range above the
zero-temperature phase transition. The analogous phenomenon of pairing
pseudogap can occur in the attractive model in two dimensions when the pairing
fluctuations become critical. Other many-body approaches are critically
compared. It is argued that treating the spin fluctuations as if there was a
Migdal's theorem can lead to wrong predictions, in particular with regard to
the the single-particle pseudogap.

For the tau -> pi^- pi^- pi^+ nu_tau decay mode, isospin violation arises from
the vector current contribution in the tau -> omega pi nu_tau decay with the
subsequent isospin violating omega decay into pi^+ pi^-. We demonstrate that
such effects may be observed in presently available data through the
measurement of the interference effects of these vector current contributions
with the dominating axial vector current, i.e. through a measurement of the
structure functions W_F,W_G,W_H and W_I. In the case of the tau -> pi^0 pi^0
pi^- nu_tau decay mode, a vector current contribution is generated by eta pi
mixing in the decay chain tau -> eta rho nu_tau -> pi^0 pi^0 pi^- nu_tau. We
find that this effect is rather small, the magnitude of the associated
interference terms being too low for present statistics.

negative curvature at the infra-red (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point. The

trajectories, which are repulsed from the Gaussian fixed point in the
