numerically within a simple discrete model for evolution of N individuals in
one-dimensional fitness space. We reduce the set of master equations to a
single Fokker-Plank equation which allows us to describe the dynamics of the
population in terms of thermo-activated Langevin diffusion of a single particle
in a specific random potential. We found that the randomness in the mutation
rate leads to pinning of the population and on average to a logarithmic
slowdown of the evolution, resembling aging phenomenon in spin glass systems.
In contrast, the randomness in the replication rate turns out to be irrelevant
for evolution in the long-time limit as it is smoothed out by increasing
``evolution temperature''. The analytic results are in a good agreement with
numerical simulations.

the point where the jet is believed to interact with the supernova remnant. The
head is clearly detected, and its X-ray spectrum is remarkably similar to the
surrounding supernova remnant spectrum, extending to X-ray energies of at least
7 keV. A ROSAT+ASCA spectrum can be fit by two-component emission models but
not standard one-component models. The lower energy component is thermal and
has a temperature of 0.29+/-0.03 keV (1 sigma); the higher energy component can
be fit by either a thermal component of temperature ~4 keV or a power law with
photon index ~2.0. Compared to the ROSAT-only results, the mechanical
properties of the jet and its cocoon do not change much. If the observed
spectrum is that of a hot jet cocoon, then the speed of the jet is at least 800
km s^-1, depending on the angle of inclination. The mechanical power driving
the jet is >10^36 erg s^-1, and the mass flow rate at the head is > 10^-6 M_sun

We investigate the special features in the spectral statistics for a periodic

both for identical and non-identical Bloch numbers. The short-time regime is
treated within the semiclassical approximation, where the spectral form factor
can be expressed in terms of a coarse-grained classical propagator which obeys
a diffusion equation with periodic boundary conditions. In the long-time
regime, the form factor decays algebraically towards an asymptotic constant. In
the limit $N\to\infty$, we derive a universal scaling function for the form
factor. The theory is supported by numerical results for quasi one-dimensional
periodic chains of coupled Sinai billiards.

dynamically disordered dipolar soft spheres are used to study ferroelectric
ordering in non-crystalline systems. We also give a physical interpretation of
the simulation results in terms of short- and long-range interactions. Cases
where the dipole moment has 1, 2, and 3 components (Ising, XY and XYZ models,
respectively) are considered. It is found that the Ising model displays
ferroelectric phases in frozen amorphous systems, while the XY and XYZ models
form dipolar glass phases at low temperatures. In the dynamically disordered
model the equations of motion are decoupled such that particle translation is
completely independent of the dipolar forces. These systems spontaneously
develop long-range ferroelectric order at nonzero temperature despite the
absence of any fined-tuned short-range spatial correlations favoring dipolar
order. Furthermore, since this is a nonequilibrium model we find that the
paraelectric to ferroelectric transition depends on the particle mass. For the
XY and XYZ models, the critical temperatures extrapolate to zero as the mass of
the particle becomes infinite, whereas, for the Ising model the critical
temperature is almost independent of mass and coincides with the ferroelectric
transition found for the randomly frozen system at the same density. Thus in

that in Eulerian coordinates a series expansion for the density of a collapsing

that Jhingan et al. have actually used Lagrangian (comoving) coordinates, and
not Eulerian coordinates. As we show, in Lagrangian coordinates there is no
restriction that the density have only even powers and hence his criticism is
invalid. We also point out that an earlier claim by Antia on the instability of
strong naked singularities in dust collapse is not supported by any concrete

supersymmetric gauge theories. After a discussion of the effective Lagrangian
in nonsupersymmetric and supersymmetric field theories, I analyze the
qualitative behavior of the simplest illustrative models. These include
supersymmetric QCD for $N_f < N_c$, in which the superpotential is generated
nonperturbatively, N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills theory (the Seiberg-Witten model), in
which the nonperturbative behavior of the effective coupling is described
geometrically, and supersymmetric QCD for N_f large, in which the theory
illustrates a non-Abelian generalization of electric-magnetic duality.

assumes the expected canonical free field form. So the black hole model seems

For fluids of large viscosity, the selected wave pattern consists of parallel

capillary regime (large frequencies). At lower frequencies (the mixed
gravity-capillary regime), a sequence of six-fold (hexagonal), eight-fold, ...
