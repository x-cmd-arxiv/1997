a dwarf elliptical, it has some properties that are similar to dwarf irregular
galaxies. It contains two bright knots of emission, one of which is red and
unresolved and the other blue and resolved. The blue knot also shows a high
excitation emission line spectrum. The observed line ratios indicate that this
is an HII region, although with some line ratios that are border-line with
those in AGN. The emission line luminosity is consistent with ionisation by a
single, very luminous O star, or several smaller O stars, but the extended blue
light in the knot shows that this has occurred as part of a substantial recent
star formation event. We find that the metal abundance, while low compared to
typical large galaxies, actually seems to be high for such a low luminosity
dwarf. The position of A0951 in the literature is incorrect and we provide the
correct value.

maser to be RA(B1950)= 13 02 32.28 +/- 0.02 ; Dec(B1950)= -49 12 01.9 +/- 0.1.
The uncertainties in earlier estimates are at least several arcseconds. The
maser lies within 2'' (36 pc at a distance of 3.7 Mpc) of the peaks in 1.4 GHz

symmetrically stradle the systemic emission on the sky, which suggests material
in edge-on circular motion around a central object. The position-velocity

of radius about 0.3 pc. This implies that the central engine radiates on the

galaxies so the bifurcation is greater. The bimodality signal is especially
clear when galaxies with close companions are excluded from consideration. High
and low surface brightness pairs with essentially identical luminosities and
maximum rotation characteristics are compared. It is suggested that the high
surface brightness galaxies have self-gravitating disks while the low surface
brightness galaxies are halo dominated at all radii. Evidently the intermediate
surface brightness regime is unstable. If a disk has sufficiently low angular
momentum and it shrinks enough that the disk potential begins to dominate the
halo potential locally, then the disk must secularly evolve to the high surface

transition at the H-dependent temperature T_{c}^{2D} below the critical
temperature T_{\lambda} of the bulk system. However, right at the critical
temperature the ratio of the areal superfluid density to the critical

collapsed onto a single curve by introducing an effective thickness H_{eff} = H

function in the 1D and 2D t-J model. By studying the scaling properties with J
and t we find a simple building pattern in 1D and show that every spectral
feature can be uniquely assigned by a spinon and holon momentum. We find two
types of low energy excitations: a band with energy scale J and high spectral
weight disperses upwards in the interior part of the Brillouin zone and reaches
E_F at k_F, and a band with energy scale t and low spectral weight disperses
downwards in the outer part of the zone, touching E_F at 3k_F. An analogous
analysis of the 2D case at half filling shows that the t-band exists also in
this case, but is diffuse and never reaches the Fermi energy. For the doped
case in 2D the picture is more reminiscent of 1D, in particular the `main-band'
with a dispersion proportional J and the `shadow band' with energy scale t can
be identified also in this case. This leads us to propose that the shadow bands
discovered by Aebi et al. in Bi2212 are the 2D analogue of the 3k_F singularity
in 1D systems and unrelated to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.

an avalanche with the dynamics of invasion percolation to show that above $d=6$
avalanches become flat and the invasion is well described as an annealed
process with correlated noise. In fact, for $d\geq5$ the overall roughness is
the same as the annealed roughness. In very large dimensions, strong

contribution, obtained by neglecting angular ordering, satisfies the BFKL

complete - the exact next-to-leading contribution is not yet available - these
corrections are important since they come from the physical property of
coherence of QCD radiation. In particular we discuss the subleading correction
to the BFKL characteristic function and the gluon distribution's dependence on
the maximum available angle. Conformal invariance of the BFKL equation is lost,
however this is not enough to bring the small-x gluon distribution into the
perturbative regime: although large momentum regions are enhanced by angular
ordering, the small momentum regions are not fully suppressed. As a
consequence, the gluon anomalous dimension is finite and tends to the BFKL
value $\gamma=1/2$ for $\alpha_S \to 0$. The main physical differences with
respect to the BFKL case are that angular ordering leads to 1) a larger gluon
anomalous dimension, 2) less singular behaviour for $x \to 0$ and 3) reduced
diffusion in transverse momentum.

  For this reason the LSND experiment where neutrinos are produced from muon
decay has two orders of magnitude more sensitivity to neutrino mass square
difference than other experiments where the neutrinos are produced from pion or
kaon decays.We also show that there are no EPR type oscillations of the
secondary decay particles.

Chern-Simons form leaving the action invariant, and D=4k+2 where the
corresponding ostensibly SO(1,1) rotation is not only not an invariance but

explicitly in the Maxwell case how the usual Dirac quantization arises in a
fully symmetric approach attaching strings to both types of charges. Finally,
for D=4k+2 systems, we show how charges can be introduced for self-dual

tracing their duality invariance to a partial invariance in the higher

central charge proportional to $ c^{2} $. Thus it is clear that quantum null

on the coherent information, which plays a role in quantum information theory

theory. Many new properties of the coherent information and entanglement
fidelity are proved. Two non-classical features of the coherent information are
demonstrated: the failure of subadditivity, and the failure of the pipelining
inequality. Both properties arise as a consequence of quantum entanglement, and
give quantum information new features not found in classical information
