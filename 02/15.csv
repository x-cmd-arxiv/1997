$H^\bullet(\CQ^L_\alpha,\BQ)$ of Laumon's spaces or, equivalently, the
Intersection Cohomology $H^\bullet(\CQ^L_\alpha,IC)$ of Drinfeld's Quasimaps'

line-of-sight velocity profiles of galaxies. Following Schwarzschild's modeling
approach, a representative library of orbits is calculated in a given
potential; then the non-negative superposition of these orbits is determined to
fit best a given set of observational constraints. Our implementation
incorporates several new features: (i) we calculate velocity profiles and
represent them by a Gauss-Hermite series. This allows us to constrain the
orbital anisotropy in the fit. (ii) we take into account the error on each
observational constraint to obtain an objective chi2 measure for the
quality-of-fit. Only projected, observable quantities are included in the fit,
and aperture binning and seeing convolution of the data are properly taken into
account. This scheme is valid for any geometry, but here we focus on spherical
geometry and the issue of dark halos around elliptical galaxies. We model
radially extended velocity profiles of the E0 galaxy NGC 2434, and find that
constant M/L models are clearly ruled out, regardless of the orbital
anisotropy. To study how much dark matter is needed, we considered a sequence
of cosmologically motivated `star+halo' potentials, which are specified by the
stellar mass-to-light ratio Gamma and the characteristic halo velocity, V_200
(from Navarro et al. 1996). The star+halo models provide an excellent fit to
the data, with Gamma=3.35+-0.25 (in B-band solar units) and V_200=450+-100km/s.
The best-fitting potential has a circular velocity Vc that is constant (at
~300km/s) to within 10% between 0.2--3 effective radii. In NGC 2434 roughly
half of the mass within an effective radius appears to be dark.

of the rho(770) meson is uniquely determined by vector-meson dominance in
electromagnetic interactions; flavor and chiral symmetry breaking effects
modify the coupling of other vector mesons and axial-vector mesons. Many decay
rates are calculated and compared to experimental data and partly to
predictions of other models. A parameter-free description of the decay K^+ -->
pi^+ e^+e^- is obtained. Predictions for several not yet observed decay rates

vector current hypothesis and meson dominance is clarified. Phenomenological
success of the meson dominance suggests that in some calculations based on the

the size $\beta$), $\intdr |\psi_r(r)|^2 \rho(r)$, shows a quasiscaling
behavior. This is approximately invariant under the following transformation:
$(\beta,Z_{eff}) \to (\lambda\beta,\lambda Z_{eff})$; $\lambda >0$. We called
such behavior $\beta-Z_{eff}$ quasiscaling. We examine this quasiscaling
behavior in detail. In particular we provide a semi-analytical examination of
this behavior and confirm it for the exponential pionic source functions in
addition to the Gaussian ones and for the production of K mesons as well. When
combined with the results of the HBT, a result of the yield ratio allows us to
estimate the size of the central charged fragment (CCF) to be $125\le
Z_{eff}\le 150$ for Pb+Pb collisions at energy 158 GeV/nucleon. From our
estimation, the baryon number density $0.024 \le n_{B}\le0.036$ [1/fm^3] is
obtained.

the supersymmetric Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integral and the character
expansion technique as mathematical tools for deriving these relations. As a
byproduct we also obtain closed expressions for the supercharacters and
dimensions of some particular irreducible U(m|n) representations. A new way of

proposed. Finally, as a corollary of our results, new identities among the

presented.

particular attention is given to predictions for the integrated scattering

Finally, current work is described and the influence of the nuclear bound state
problem (treated in relativistic mean field theory) on the Dirac scattering

truncated perturbation series by recasting it via the modified Laplace integral
representation. The modification of the Laplace transformation is such that the
upper limit of integration is cut off and an extra term is added for the
compensation. For the non-Gaussian integral, we find that the perturbation
series can give accurate result and the obtained approximation converges to the
exact result in the $N \to \infty$ limit ($N$ denotes the order of perturbation
expansion). In the case of anharmonic oscillator, we show that several order
result yields good approximation of the ground state energy over the entire

slowly on (at least) two time scales. This phenomenon has gained recent
attention due to experimental observations of the history dependent relaxation
behavior in amorphous materials (``Glasses'') which pose a challenge to
theorist. Aging signals the breaking of time-translational invariance and the
violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem during the relaxation process.
But while the origin of aging in disordered media is profound, and the
discussion is clad in the language of a well-developed theory, systems as
simple as a random walk near a wall can exhibit aging. Such a simple walk
serves well to illustrate the phenomenon and some of the physics behind it.
