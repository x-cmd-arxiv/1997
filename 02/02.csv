types F and A are excellent candidates for a new extragalactic candle. These
post-AGB (PAGB) stars are the brightest members of Population II systems. They
should have a narrow luminosity function, bounded from above by the shorter
transition times of more massive and more luminous remnants, and from below by
the core mass corresponding to the lowest-mass stars that are leaving the main
sequence. Moreover, PAGB A-F supergiants are easily recognized because of their
enormous Balmer jumps, and should lie both in ellipticals and the halos of
spirals. I describe a photometric system that combines Gunn u with the standard
BVI bandpasses, and report a successful search for PAGB stars in the halo of
M31 using this uBVI system. The zero-point calibration will come from PAGB A
and F stars in Galactic globular clusters. Four are presently known, and have a
mean Mv = -3.4 with a scatter of only 0.2 mag. With this Mv we exactly
reproduce the accepted M31 distance from its halo PAGB stars. Future plans
include a uBVI survey of Milky Way globular clusters and Local Group galaxies
in order to strengthen the zero-point calibration. Ultimately we can reach the
Virgo Cluster through a distance ladder with only three rungs: subdwarf
parallaxes, Milky Way globular clusters, and then directly to Virgo (with HST).

instrument for 19k seconds during 1996 March 24th. We applied the
contemporaneous radio ephemeris and various statistical tests to search for
evidence of pulsation. These analyses yield intriguing yet inconclusive
evidence for the presence of the pulsation in the time series: confidence level
for the presence of pulsation is 94.5% in the 2.0-4.8 keV band and 97.6% in the
4.8-6.3 keV band based on the H-test. Under the premise of non-detection of
pulsation, we derive estimated 2-sigma upper limits for the pulsed flux to be
$3.3\times 10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1} keV^{-1}$ in the 2.0-4.8 keV band, $2.7\times
10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1} keV^{-1}$ in the 4.8-8.5 keV band, and $2.0\times
10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1} keV^{-1}$ in the 8.5-13.0 keV band. These upper limits
are consistent with the trend of spectral turn-over from high-energy gamma-ray
emission as suggested by the OSSE upper limit. Such turn-over strongly suggests
the outer magnetosphere as the emission site for pulsed gamma-rays. These RXTE
upper limits for X-ray pulsation are, on the other hand, not consistent with
the extrapolation of reported power-law spectra from the point source observed
by ROSAT in the 0.1-2.4 keV band, assuming a constant pulse fraction: The
pulsed soft X-ray emission detected by ROSAT must follow a much softer spectrum
than that of the overall point source.

in curved backgrounds using a new method for the determination of the heat
kernel involving a re-summation of the Schwinger-DeWitt series.
Self-interactions are treated both to one loop order as usual and slightly
beyond one-loop order by means of a mean-field approximation. The new approach
gives the familiar result for scalar fields, the Coleman-Weinberg potential
plus corrections such as the leading-log terms, but the actual calculation is
much faster. We furthermore show how to go systematically to higher loop order.
The Schwarzschild space-time is used to exemplify the procedure. Next we
consider phase transitions and we show that for a classical critical point to
be a critical point of the effective potential too, certain restrictions must
be imposed on as well its value as on the form of the classical potential and
the background geometry. We derive this extra condition for scalar fields with
arbitrary self couplings and comment on the case of fermions and gauge bosons
too. Critical points of the effective action which are not there classically
are also discussed. This has implications for inflation. The renormalised
energy-momentum tensor for a scalar field with arbitrary self-interaction and
non-minimal coupling to the gravitational background is also calculated to this
improved one-loop order as is the resulting conformal anomaly. Conditions for
the violation of energy conditions are described. Finally we discuss metric
fluctuations and a self-consistency condition for such fluctuations is written
down for spin 0,1/2,1 quantum fields. This is of importance for the study of
cosmic density fluctuations. All calculations are performed in the physically
