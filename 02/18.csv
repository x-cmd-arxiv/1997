compact group by means of deep CCD images in the B, V and R photometric bands
and long-slit spectroscopy. The four galaxies of this spiral rich group show
signs of gravitational interaction. Two long tails come out from the contact
region of the close pair H96ac. It is also there where both galaxies,
bi-symmetrical in their inner parts, loose one of their arms. Moreover, both
the photometric and kinematical center of H96a are displaced relative to the
center of the disk. H96b, a giant elliptical galaxy, shows significant
deviations from a $r^{1/4}$ law at the inner parts and small rotation along its
major axis. We find at the centre of the galaxy an elongated component which is
kinematically decoupled. A wide faint plume seems to emerge from this galaxy.
H96d, the smallest galaxy of the group, seems to be influenced by the bigger
members, as indicated by three prominent knots of recent bursts of star
formation in its blue disk, and by hints of optical bridges joining H96d with
H96a and b. Finally the group has a low velocity dispersion (160 km/s) and is
well isolated - no galaxies with comparable magnitude to H96a or H96b are found
in its neighborhood. All these results lead us to conclude that Hickson 96
constitutes a real physical system.

cluster (GC) research are the multimodal GC metallicity distributions seen in
massive early-type galaxies. We explore the origin of these distinct GC
populations, the implications for galaxy formation and evolution, and identify
several new properties of GC systems. First, when we separate the metal-rich
and metal-poor subpopulations, in galaxies with bimodal GC metallicity
distributions, we find that the mean metallicity of the metal-rich GCs
correlates well with parent galaxy luminosity but the mean metallicity of the
metal-poor ones does not. This indicates that the metal-rich GCs are closely
coupled to the galaxy and share a common chemical enrichment history with the
galaxy field stars. The mean metallicity of the metal-poor population is
largely independent of the galaxy luminosity. Second, the slope of the GC
system radial surface density varies considerably in early-type galaxies.
However the galaxies with relatively populous GC systems for their luminosity
(called high specific frequency, S_N) only have shallow, extended radial
distributions. A characteristic of high S_N galaxies is that their GCs are
preferentially located in the outer galaxy regions relative to the underlying
starlight. Third, we find that the ratio of metal-rich to metal-poor GCs
correlates with S_N. In other words, high S_N galaxies have proportionately
more metal-poor GCs, per unit galaxy light, than low S_N galaxies. Fourth, we
find steeper metallicity gradients in high S_N galaxies. This is due to the
greater number of metal-poor GCs at large galactocentric radii. We critically
review current ideas for the origin of GCs in giant elliptical (gE) and cD
galaxies and conclude that the gaseous merger model of Ashman & Zepf (1992) is

Pierce (1994), calibrated using the Cepheid results of Sandage et al (1996).
The Tully-Fisher distances mostly come from the work of Pierce (1994). The
results show that the Tully-Fisher distance moduli are too short with respect
to the Cepheid distances by 0.46+-0.14mag and too short with respect to the
SNIa distances by 0.46+-0.19mag. Combining the HST Cepheid and SNIa data
suggests that, overall, previous Tully-Fisher distances were too short by
0.46+-0.11mag, a result which is significant at the 4sigma level. These data
therefore indicate that previous Tully-Fisher distances should be revised
upwards by 24+-6% implying, for example, a Virgo distance of 19.3+-1.9Mpc. The

from Ho=84+-10 to Ho=68+-8.

Kinematic observations show that M32 has a central black hole of 3x10^6 solar
masses, and a phase-space distribution function that is close to the
`two-integral' form f=f(E,L_z). M32 is also rapidly rotating; 85-90% of the
stars have the same sense of rotation around the symmetry axis. Previous work
has shown that flattened, rapidly rotating two-integral models can be
bar-unstable. We have performed N-body simulations to test whether this is the
case for M32. Particle realizations with N=512,000 were studied for two
representative inclinations, i=90 (edge-on) and i=55, corresponding to
intrinsic axial ratios of q=0.73 and q=0.55, respectively. The time evolution
of the models was calculated with a `self-consistent field' code on a Cray T3D
parallel supercomputer. We find both models to be dynamically stable. This
implies that they provide a physically meaningful description of M32, and that
the inclination of M32 (and hence its intrinsic flattening) cannot be strongly
constrained through stability arguments.
  Previous work on the stability of f(E,L_z) models has shown that the bar-mode
is the only possibly unstable mode for systems rounder than q=0.3, and that the
likelihood for this mode to be unstable increases with flattening and rotation
rate. The f(E,L_z) models studied for M32 are stable, and M32 has a higher
rotation rate than nearly all other elliptical galaxies. This suggests that
f(E,L_z) models constructed to fit data for real elliptical galaxies will
generally be stable for q>0.55, and possibly for flatter systems as well.

(T> T_{cp}), this process transforms into the well known electron synchrotron
emission of neutrino pairs in a locally uniform magnetic field B, with the
neutrino energy loss rate Q proportional to B^2 T^5. For temperatures T not
much below T_{cp}, the synchrotron regime (Q \propto T^5) persists and the
emissivity Q can be amplified by several orders of magnitude due to the
appearance of the fluxoids and associated enhancement of the field within them.
For lower T, the synchrotron regime transforms into the bremsstrahlung regime
(Q \propto T^6) similar to the ordinary neutrino-pair bremsstrahlung of
electrons which scatter off atomic nuclei. We calculate Q numerically and
represent our results through a suitable analytic fit. In addition, we estimate
the emissivities of two other neutrino-production mechanisms which are usually
neglected -- neutrino-pair bremsstrahlung processes due to electron-proton and
electron-electron collisions. We show that the electron-fluxoid and
electron-electron scattering can provide the main neutrino production
mechanisms in the neutron star cores with highly superfluid protons and
neutrons at T < 5 10^8 K. The electron-fluxoid scattering is significant if the
initial, locally uniform magnetic field B > 10^{13} G.

range interactions over stretched DNA regions. The mobility of ring-shaped DNA
is found to saturate much as in the well-studied case of linear DNA.
Experiments in polymer gels, however, show that the mobility drops
exponentially with the DNA ring size. This is commonly attributed to
dangling-ends in the gel that can impale the ring. The predictions of the

polarization along one very choice which is however randomly selected. A small
external social pressure is shown to have a drastic effect on the polarization.
Individual bias related to personal backgrounds, cultural values and past

to be instrumental in generating a larger spectrum of collective new choices
beyond initial ones. In particular, compromise is found to result from the
existence of individual competing bias. Conflict is shown to weaken group

by Prikry forcing, is proved. If L[E] is an ""iterable"" weasel with no
measurable cardinals, then either L[E] has ""indiscernibles"", or every
uncountable set of ordinals is contained in a set in L[E] of the same
cardinality. (The terms ""iterable"" and ""indiscernibles"" are made precise in the
paper.) Most importantly, there is no hypothesis explicitly limiting the large
cardinals which are consistent in L[E].

reactions are thought to be directly proportional to the Gamow-Teller
transition strengths in the nuclei. Assuming that this relationship also holds
for charge exchange induced by high-energy heavy ions, it would be very useful
in studies with radioactive beams. Contrary to this expectation, we show that
the determination of Gamow-Teller and Fermi matrix elements from heavy-ion
charge-exchange at forward angles is very inaccurate.
