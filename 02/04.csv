scenarios for these object multiplets: 1) the objects are star-forming regions
within normal galaxies, whose disks have been relatively dimmed by K-correction
and surface brightness dimming; 2) they are fragments merging into large
galaxies; 3) they are satellites accreting onto normal L_* galaxies. We find
that hypothesis 1 is most tenable. First, large galaxies in the process of a
merger formation would have accumulated too much mass in their centers (5e12
M_sun inside 2 kpc) to correspond to present day objects. Second, accretion by
dynamical friction occurs with a predictable density vs. radius slope, not seen
among the faint HDF objects. Since the dynamical friction time is roughly (1
Gyr), a steady-state should have been reached by redshift z < 5. Star-forming
regions within galaxies clearly present no dynamical problems. Since large
spirals would still appear as such in the HDF, we favor a scenario in which the
faint compact sources in the HDF are giant starforming regions within small
normal galaxies, such as Magellanic irregulars. Finally we checked that
reduction in mass-to-light from induced star-formation cannot alone explain the

the origin of metals in an intra-cluster medium (ICM) is not a type-Ia

the solar photospheric iron abundance for ASCA data reduction, while the
meteoritic iron abundance is usually adopted in chemical-evolution studies. It
is true that although the photospheric and meteoritic solar abundances are
consistent for most of the elements, a serious discrepancy is known to exist
for iron; indeed, the photospheric abundance of iron is $N_{Fe}/N_H = 4.68
10^{-5}$ by number, while the meteoritic value is $3.24 10^{-5}$. The argument
concerning the relative roles of SNIa and SNII in ICM enrichment is quite
sensitive to the precise values of [\alpha/Fe], and one should use an identical
solar iron abundance in data reduction as well as in theoretical arguments. We
therefore adopt the meteoritic iron abundance, which is consistent with
chemical-evolution studies, and shift Mushotzky et al.'s ASCA data by
$\Delta[\alpha/Fe] \simeq -0.16$ dex. By comparing the corrected [\alpha/Fe]
values with theoretical nucleosynthesis prescriptions of SNIa and SNII, we
reach a conclusion that an SNIa iron contribution of 50% or higher in the ICM

particular on its dependence on the strain conditions and on the strain induced
electric fields. We propose a procedure to locate the interface plane where the
band alignment could be evaluated; furthermore, we suggest that the
polarization charges, due to piezoelectric effects, are approximately confined
to a narrow region close to the interface and do not affect the potential
discontinuity. We find that the interface contribution to the valence band
offset is substantially unaffected by strain conditions, whereas the total band
line-up is highly tunable, as a function of the strain conditions. Finally, we
compare our results with those obtained for [001] heterojunctions.

decreases only slightly. The situation is different in the isoscalar channel.
Here the mass and therefore the peak position of the $\omega$ meson decreases
strongly while the width increases less drastically than in the $\rho$ meson

broadens due to the imaginary part of the scattering length. We find a
remarkable degree of consistency with the operator product expansion of QCD sum

called a relative invariant polynomial if there exists a character \chi such
that \delta(gx)=\chi(g)\delta(x). Such \delta(x) exists for our case and is
essentially unique. So we define V^{ss}={x in V such that \delta(x) is not
equal to 0}. For x in V_R^{ss}, let H_{x R+}^0 be the connected component of 1
in classical topology of the stabilizer H_{x R}. We will prove that if x in
V_R^ss is ""sufficiently irrational"", H_{x R+}^0 H_Z is dense in H_R.

graph on each group G whose commutator subgroup is cyclic of prime-power order.
This paper considers connected, vertex-transitive graphs X of order at least 3
where the automorphism group of X contains a transitive subgroup G whose
commutator subgroup is cyclic of prime-power order. We show that of these
graphs, only the Petersen graph is not hamiltonian.

nuclear matter in the Walecka model using a nonperturbative approach. We first
study such a contribution as arising from a ground state structure with
baryon-antibaryon condensates. This yields the same results as obtained through
the relativistic Hartree approximation of summing tadpole diagrams for the
baryon propagator. Such a vacuum is then generalized to include quantum effects
from meson fields through scalar-meson condensates. The method is applied to
study properties of nuclear matter and leads to a softer equation of state
giving a lower value of the incompressibility than would be reached without
quantum effects. The density dependent effective sigma mass is also calculated
including such vacuum polarisation effects.

recently proposed to study molecular vibrational spectra [Zhong-Qi Ma et al.,
Phys. Rev. A 53, 2173 (1996)]. Because of the local nature of the bosons the
model has to deal with spurious degrees of freedom. An approach to eliminate
the latter from both the Hamiltonian and the basis was suggested. We show that
this procedure does not remove all spurious components from the Hamiltonian and
leads to a restricted set of interactions. We then propose a scheme in which
the physical Hamiltonian can be systematically constructed up to any order
without the need of imposing conditions on its matrix elements. In addition, we
show that this scheme corresponds to the harmonic limit of a symmetry adapted
algebraic approach based on U(2) algebras.
