evolution of competing computer programs in artificial life simulations shows
signs of being a self-organized critical process. The primary evidence for this
claim comes from the distribution of the lifetimes of species in the
simulations, which appears to follow a power law. We argue that, for a number
of reasons, it is unlikely that the system is in fact at a critical point and
suggest an alternative explanation for the power-law lifetime distribution.

recent work, distribution function solutions of the Boltzmann equation and/or
third moments in Jeans equations have been used to obtain a more consistent
description of our Galaxy. In this paper, we give a short review of
observational constraints and the different values usualy taken for global
parameters describing our Galaxy, namely the slope of the circular velocity
curve, the density and kinematic scale lengths. Secondly we build a new model
of Shu-type distribution functions where scale lengths and the shape of the
velocity curve are free parameters. Thirdly we compare and adjust this model to
velocity distributions of stars in the solar neighbourhood taken from the
Gliese catalogue and other ones. Implicit constraints are related to the
asymmetric drift relation and the Lindblad equation that gives the ratio of
radial and tangential velocity dispersions. We conclude that extended Shu
distribution functions recover most of the fundamental kinematic properties of
the galactic disc. We show that it is possible to build a consistent model
explaining local stellar kinematics and to determine local structural galactic
parameters.

around the FP is similar for all four clusters. There may be indications that
the slope of the FP is more shallow for the intermediate redshift clusters than
for the Coma cluster. More complete samples of galaxies in intermediate
redshift clusters are needed to map in detail the possible change of the slope
as function of redshift. The mass-to-light (M/L) ratio as measured by the FP
changes with redshift. At z=0.18 the M/L ratio (in Gunn r) is 16+-9% smaller
than for the Coma cluster. Together with earlier results reported for CL0024+16
this implies that the M/L ratio changes with redshift as Delta log M/L_r ~ -0.4
Delta z. The results presented here are in agreement with passive evolution of
a stellar population, which formed at a redshift larger than one. However, the
possible presence of more recent bursts of star formation complicates the

and gas in cold dark matter dominated universe with the cosmological density
parameter, $\Omega_0 = 1$ or $0.2$. A shock front appears during its initial
collapse, moving outward as ambient gas accretes towards cluster center. The
shock front separates the inner X-ray emitting, hot region, where gas is almost
in hydrostatic equilibrium but with small radial infall ($\sim 100$km s$^{-1}$)
being left, from the outer cool region. Gas inside the shock is strongly
compressed and heated by shock so that X-ray luminosity rapidly rises in the
early stage. In the late stage, however, the X-ray luminosity rises only
gradually due partly to the expansion of the inner high temperature region and
partly to the increase of X-ray emissivity of gas as the results of continuous
adiabatic compression inside the shock. The shock front structure, which was
not clearly resolved in the previous SPH simulations, is clearly captured by
the present simulations. In addition, we find a sound wave propagating outward,
thereby producing spatial modulations with amplitudes of $\sim$ 10 % in the
radial temperature and density profiles and time variations in the strength of
the shock. Such modulations, if observed, could be used as a probe to
investigate the structure of clusters.

model of $\lyal$-absorbing gas confined in both populations of halos, we
attempt to explain the recent observations of (1) associations of visible
galaxies with $\lyal$ lines at low redshifts $z \la 1$, and (2) metal lines
associated with a non-negligible fraction of low H I column density $\lyal$
lines at $z \sim 3$. For galactic halos, we find that photoionized gas clouds
confined in the pressure of ambient hot gas can produce $\lyal$ absorptions
with H I column density as low as $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that the impact
parameter of a sightline for such absorptions matches well with the observed
radius of gaseous envelope in a typical luminous galaxy. Using the Press-
Schechter prescription for the mass function of halos, we also show that the
fraction of $\lyal$ lines with associated metal lines can be understood in
terms of the fraction of $\lyal$ absorbers that are associated with galactic
halos. In particular, the reported fraction of $\sim 0.5--0.75$ at $z \sim 3$
is reproduced when the boundary value of $V_c$ to separate mini or galactic

terminals of metallic diffusive conductors. We start from scattering matrix
expressions for the shot noise and use the Fisher-Lee relation in combination
with diagram technique to evaluate the noise correlations. Of particular
interest are exchange (interference) effects analogous to the Hanbury
Brown--Twiss effect in optics. We find that the exchange effect exists in the
ensemble averaged current correlations. Depending on the geometry, it might
have the same magnitude as the mean square current fluctuations of the shot
noise. The approach which we use is first applied to present a novel derivation
of the 1/3-suppression of shot noise in a two-terminal geometry, valid for an
arbitrary relation between the length and wire width. We find that in all
geometries correlations are insensitive to dephasing.

realization of the non-Fermi-liquid physics of the T=0 fixed point of the
2-channel Kondo model. In this, the first in a series of three papers
(I,II,III) devoted to 2-channel Kondo physics, we present a comprehensive
review of the quenched Cu ZBA experiments and their 2CK interpretation,
including new results on ZBAs in constrictions made from Ti or from metallic
glasses. We first review the evidence that the ZBAs are due to electron
scattering from stuctural defects that are not static, but possess internal
dynamics. In order to distinguish between several mechanisms proposed to
explain the experiments, we then analyze the scaling properties of the
conductance at low temperature and voltage and extract from the data a
universal scaling function $\Gamma(v)$. The theoretical calculation of the
corresponding scaling function within the 2CK model is the subject of papers II
and III. The main conclusion of our work is that the properties of the ZBAs,
and most notably their scaling behavior, are in good agreement with the 2CK
model and clearly different from several other proposed mechanisms.

assumption that the interaction between electrons and nearly degenerate
two-level systems in the constriction can be described, for sufficiently small
voltages and temperatures ($V,T < \Tk$), by the 2-channel Kondo (2CK) model.
Motivated by these experiments, we introduce a generalization of the 2CK model,
which we call the nanoconstriction 2-channel Kondo model (NTKM), that takes
into account the complications arising from the non-equilibrium electron
distribution in the nanoconstriction. We calculate the conductance $G(V,T)$ of
the constriction in the weakly non-equilibrium regime of $V,T \ll \Tk$ by
combining concepts from Hershfield's $Y$-operator formulation of
non-equilibrium problems and Affleck and Ludwig's exact conformal field theory
(CFT) solution of the 2CK problem (CFT technicalities are discussed in a
subsequent paper, III). Finally, we extract from the conductance a universal
scaling curve $\Gamma(v)$ and compare it with experiment. Combining our results
with those of Hettler, Kroha and Hershfield, we conclude that the NTKM achieves
quantitative agreement with the experimental scaling data.

exponentially to some, in general undetermined, equilibrium state. To prove
this, three conditions are imposed on these theories. The first condition
requires the system of equations to be symmetric hyperbolic, a fundamental
requisite to have a well posed and physically consistent initial value
formulation. The second condition is a generic consequence of the entropy law,
and is imposed on the non principal part of the equations. The third condition
is imposed on the principal part of the equations and it implies that the
dissipation affects all the fields of the theory. With these requirements we
prove that all the eigenvalues of the symbol associated to the system of
equations of the fluid theory have strictly negative real parts, which in fact,
is an alternative characterization for the theory to be totally dissipative.

relies on the quantum affine symmetry of the model, which allows for a
systematic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit and
for an exact calculation of matrix elements of local spin operators. In fact,
we argue that the familiar criticism of this method related to the complication
of these matrix elements is not justified. First, we give, in the form of
contour integrals, an exact expression for the n-spinon contribution. After we
compile recently found results concerning the two-spinon contribution, we
specialize the n-spinon formula to the new case n=4. Then we give an explicit
series representation of this contribution in the isotropic limit. Finally,
after we show that this representation is free of divergences, we discuss the
Ising limit in which a simple expression is found up to first order in the
anisotropy parameter.

smooth Calabi-Yau base manifolds can be topologically distinct. These latter
examples extend and clarify a previous observation which was limited to
singular Calabi-Yau spaces and seem to indicate a multicritical structure in

characterize explicitly all the non-trivial solutions of the Wess-Zumino
