oblate grains when their temperature is comparable with grain kinetic energy
devided by k, the Boltzmann constant. For such grains, the alignment of angular
momentum, J, with the axis of maximal inertia, a, is only partial. This
substantially alters the alignment as compared with the results in Lazarian
(1995) and Roberge, Hanany & Messinger (1996) obtained on the assumption of
perfect alignment.
  We also describe the Gold alignment when the Barnett dissipation is
suppressed and derive an analytical expression which relates the measure of
alignment with parameters of grain nonsphericity and the direction of the gas -
grain drift. This solution provides the lower limit for the alignment measure,
while the upper limit is given by the analytics derived in Lazarian (1994).
Using results of a recent study of incomplete internal relaxation in Lazarian &
Roberge (1996), we find measures of alignment for the whole range of ratios of
grain rotational energy to k over T_s, where T_s is the grain temperature. To
describe alignment for mildly supersonic drifts, we suggest an analytical
approach which provides good correspondence with the results of direct
numerical simulations in Roberge, Hanany & Messinger (1995). We also extend our
approach to account for the simultaneous action of the Gold and
Davis-Greenstein mechanisms.

on the velocity and mass ratio of the colliding clouds, magnetic field
strength, and gas metallicity for head-on collisions. The problem has been
studied both analytically and via numerical simulations. We have derived handy
analytical relationships that well approximate the analogous numerical results.
The main findings of this work are: (i) the kinetic energy dissipation in cloud
collisions is minimum (i.e. the collision elasticity is maximum) for a cloud
relative velocity $v_r \simeq 30 km s^{-1}$; (ii) the above minimum value is
proportional $Z L_c^2$, where $Z$ is the metallicity and $L_c$ is the cloud
size: the larger is $Z L_c^2$ the more dissipative (i.e. inelastic) the
collision will be; (iii) in general, we find that the energy dissipation
decreases when the magnetic field strength, and mass ratio of the clouds are
increased and the metallicity is decreased, respectively. We briefly discuss
the relevance of this study to the global structure of the interstellar medium

density field acting on primordial density perturbations in power law models.
By analysing changes in the orientation of the deformation tensor, resulted
from smoothing the density field on different mass scales, we show that the
large-scale tidal field can strongly affect the morphology and orientation of
density peaks. The measure of the strength of the tidal field is performed as a
function of the distance to the peak and of the spectral index. We detected
evidence that two populations of perturbations seems to coexist; one, with a
misalignment between the main axes of their inertia and deformation tensors.
This would lead to the angular momentum acquisition and morphological changes.
For the second population, the perturbations are found nearly aligned in the
direction of the tidal field, which would imprint them low angular momentum and
which would allow an alignment of structures as those reported between clusters
of galaxies in filaments, and between galaxies in clusters. Evidence is
presented that the correlation between the orientation of perturbations and the
large-scale density field could be a common property of Gaussian density fields
with spectral indexes $n < 0$. We argue that alignment of structures can be
used to probe the flatness of the spectrum on large scales but it cannot
determine the exact value of the spectral index.

the QCD sum rule. Separation of the negative-parity spectrum is proposed and is
applied to the flavor octet and singlet baryons. We find that the quark
condensate is responsible for the mass splitting of the ground and the
negative-parity excited states. This is expected from the chiral symmetry and
supports the idea that the negative-parity baryon forms a parity doublet with
the ground state. The meson-baryon coupling constants are also computed for the
excited states in the QCD sum rule. It is found that the \pi NN^* coupling
vanishes in the chiral limit.

stringy Lie superalgebras are distinguished: only they have nontrivial central
extensions; since two of the distinguish algebras have 3 nontrivial central
extensions each, there are exactly 16 superizations of the Liouville action,
Schroedinger equation, KdV hierarchy, etc. We also present the three nontrivial
cocycles on the N=4 extended Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond superalgebras in terms of
primary fields and describe the ""classical"" stringy superalgebras close to the
simple ones. One of these stringy superalgebras is a Kac-Moody superalgebra
G(A) with a nonsymmetrizable Cartan matrix A. Unlike the Kac-Moody
superalgebras of polynomial growth with symmetrizable Cartan matrix, it can not
be interpreted as a central extension of a twisted loop algebra.The stringy
superalgebras are often referred to as superconformal ones. We discuss how
superconformal stringy superalgebras really are.

equations of motion is described by an exact evolution equation. For
conservative systems thermodynamic equilibrium is a fixed point of these
equations. We show that this fixed point is not universally stable, since
infinitely many conserved correlation functions obstruct the approach to
equilibrium. Equilibrium can therefore be reached at most for suitably averaged
quantities or for subsystems, similar to quantum statistics. The classical time
evolution of correlation functions shows many dynamical features of quantum
mechanics.
