negligible contribution to the CMB radiation power spectrum of the anisotropic
term of the lensing correlation is shown to be appreciable. However,
considering the nonlinear evolution of the matter power spectrum produces only
slight differences on the results based on linear evolution. The general
conclusion for flat as well as open universes is that lensing slightly smoothes
the radiation power spectrum. For a given range of multipoles the effect of
lensing increases with Omega but for the same acoustic peak it decreases with
$\Omega$. The maximum contribution of lensing to the radiation power spectrum
for $l\leq 2000$ is $\sim$ 5% for $\Omega$ values in the range 0.1-1.

in the first order formalism, solves the cosmological constant problem. The
most appealing formulation of the theory displays a local symmetry associated
with the arbitrariness of the measure of integration. This can be motivated by
thinking of this theory as a direct coupling of physical degrees of freedom
with a ""space - filling brane"" and in this case such local symmetry is related
to space-filling brane gauge invariance. The model is formulated in the first
order formalism using the metric and the connection as independent dynamical
variables. An additional symmetry (Einstein - Kaufman symmetry) allows to
eliminate the torsion which appears due to the introduction of the new measure
of integration. The most successful model that implements these ideas is
realized in a six or higher dimensional space-time. The compactification of
extra dimensions into a sphere gives the possibility of generating scalar
masses and potentials, gauge fields and fermionic masses. It turns out that
remaining four dimensional space-time must have effective zero cosmological
constant.

M^n has a (generally non-Abelian) gauge structure determined by geometry of
M^n. Such a gauge term is defined in terms of the vectors normal to M^n, and
its connection is called the N-connection. In order to see the global effect of
this type of connections, the case of M^1 embedded in R^3 is examined, where
the relation of an integral of the gauge potential of the N-connection (i.e.,
the torsion) along a path in M^1 to the Berry's phase is given through Gauss
mapping of the vector tangent to M^1. Through the same mapping in the case of
M^1 embedded in R^p, where the normal and the tangent quantities are exchanged,
the relation of the N-connection to the induced gauge potential on the
(p-1)-dimensional sphere S^{p-1} (p >= 3) found by Ohnuki and Kitakado is
concretely established. Further, this latter which has the monopole-like
structure is also proved to be gauge-equivalent to the spin-connection of
S^{p-1}. Finally, by extending formally the fundamental equations for M^n to
infinite dimensional case, the present formalism is applied to the field theory
that admits a soliton solution. The resultant expression is in some respects
different from that of Gervais and Jevicki.

machines by showing how the lambda-q calculus can efficiently simulate a class
of quantum cellular automaton that are equivalent to quantum Turing machines.
We conclude by noting that the lambda-q calculus may be strictly stronger than
quantum computers because NP-complete problems such as satisfiability are
efficiently solvable in the lambda-q calculus but there is a widespread doubt
that they are efficiently solvable by quantum computers.

  http://qso.lanl.gov/qc/",,"10.1098/rspa.1998.0166",,"quant-ph",,"  Recent research has demonstrated that quantum computers can solve certain
types of problems substantially faster than the known classical algorithms.
These problems include factoring integers and certain physics simulations.
Practical quantum computation requires overcoming the problems of environmental
noise and operational errors, problems which appear to be much more severe than
in classical computation due to the inherent fragility of quantum
superpositions involving many degrees of freedom. Here we show that arbitrarily
accurate quantum computations are possible provided that the error per
operation is below a threshold value. The result is obtained by combining
quantum error-correction, fault tolerant state recovery, fault tolerant
encoding of operations and concatenation. It holds under physically realistic
assumptions on the errors.

Results from scattering theory can be utilized to solve the initial value
problem and discuss the system as a model of wave packet preparation. Extensive
use is made of the analytic properties of the propagators, and simple model
systems are evaluated to illustrate the argument. We verify the exponential
appearence of the continuum state and its propagation as a localized wave
packet.
