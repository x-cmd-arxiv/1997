  Effects in Gravitational Microlensing","32 pages including 6 tables, and 15 figures; Uses AASTeX 4.0;
  submitted to The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/304974",,"astro-ph",,"  We present analysis of MACHO Alert 95-30, a dramatic gravitational
microlensing event towards the Galactic bulge whose peak magnification departs
significantly from the standard point-source microlensing model. Alert 95-30
was observed in real-time by the Global Microlensing Alert Network (GMAN),
which obtained densely sampled photometric and spectroscopic data throughout
the event. We interpret the light-curve ``fine structure'' as indicating
transit of the lens across the extended face of the source star. This signifies
resolution of a star several kpc distant. We find a lens angular impact
parameter theta_{min}/theta_{source} = 0.715 +/- 0.003. This information, along
with the radius and distance of the source, provides an additional constraint
on the lensing system. Spectroscopic and photometric data indicate the source
is an M4 III star of radius 61 +/- 12 Rsun, located on the far side of the
bulge at 9 kpc. We derive a lens angular velocity, relative to the source, of
21.5 +/- 4.9 km/s/kpc, where the error is dominated by uncertainty in the
source radius. Likelihood analysis yields a median lens mass of
0.67{+2.53}{-0.46} Msun, located with 80% probability in the Galactic bulge at
a distance of 6.93{+1.56}{-2.25} kpc. If the lens is a main-sequence star, we
can include constraints on the lens luminosity. This modifies our estimates to
M_lens = 0.53{+0.52}{-0.35} Msun and D_lens = 6.57{+0.99}{-2.25} kpc. Spectra
taken during the event show that the absorption line equivalent widths of H
alpha and the TiO bands near 6700 A vary, as predicted for microlensing of an
extended source. This is most likely due to center-to-limb variation in the
stellar spectral lines. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using
microlensing limb crossings as a tool to probe stellar atmospheres directly.

maps with nearest neighbour coupling and periodic boundary conditions. The
stability analysis for an arbitrary spatial period k is carried out in terms of
the independent variables of the problem and the stability matrix is reduced to
a neat block diagonal form. For a lattice of size kN, we show that the largest
eigenvalue for the stability matrix of size $kN \times kN$ is the same as that
for the basic spatial period k matrix of size $k \times k$. Thus the analysis
for a kN lattice case can be reduced to that for a k lattice case. We
illustrate this explicitly for a spatial period two case. Our formalism is
general and can be extended to any coupled map lattice. We also obtain the
stability regions of solutions which have the same spatial and temporal period
numerically. Our analysis shows that such regions form a set of Arnold tongues
in the $\Omega-\epsilon-K$ space. The tongues corresponding to higher spatial
periods are contained within the tongues seen in the temporally periodic
spatial period one or synchronised case. We find an interesting new bifurcation
wherein the the spatially synchronised and temporal period one solution
undergoes a bifurcation to a spatio-temporal period two travelling wave
solution. The edges of the stability interval of this solution are analytically
obtained.

length vacuum oscillations on the way to the Earth, triggered by Delta m^2_{21}

bring the Hamiltonian to diagonal (or band diagonal) form, is applied to the
Hamiltonian theory as an exact renormalization scheme. We consider QED on the
light front to illustrate the method. The low-energy generated interaction,
induced in the renormalized Hamiltonian to the order \alpha, is shown to be
negative to insure together with instantaneous term and perturbative photon
exchange the bound states for positronium. It is possible to perform the
complete complete elimination of the ee\gamma-vertex in the instant form frame;
this gives rise to the cutoff independent e\bar{e}-interaction governed by
generated and instantaneous terms. The well known result for the
singlet-triplet splitting $7/6 \alpha^2 Ryd$ is recovered in the
nonrelativistic limit as long as $\la << m$.
  We examine the mass and wave function renormalization. The ultraviolet
divergencies, associated with a large transverse momentum, are regularized by
the regulator arising from the unitary transformation. The severe infrared
divergencies are removed if all diagrams to the second order, arising from flow
equations method and normal-ordering Hamiltonian, are taken into account. The
electron (photon) mass in the renormalized Hamiltonian vary with UV cutoff in
accordance with 1-loop renormalization group equations.This indicates to an
intimete connection between Wilson's renormalization and the flow equation
method.

group approach are discussed.
