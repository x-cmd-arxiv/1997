between internal properties and location inside the host galaxy and we provide
an estimate for the rates of core collapse and disruption of globular clusters.
The initial mass function and spatial distribution of the cluster system evolve
quite significantly in one Hubble time and the evolution is toward a final
state similar to the observed one. If the mass function is initially taken to
be a log-normal distribution similar to the one currently observed in our

Cygnus X-1 throughout its 1996 spectral transitions. The entire period can be
divided into 3 distinct phases: (1) transition from the hard to soft state, (2)
soft state, and (3) transition from the soft state back to the hard state. The
observed X-ray properties in phases 1 and 3 are remarkably similar, suggesting
that the same physical processes are likely involved in triggering such
transitions. The power density spectrum (PDS) during the transition can be
characterized by a red noise component, followed by a white noise component
which extends to roughly 1-3 Hz where it is cut off, and a steeper power law at
higher frequencies. The X-ray flux also exhibits apparent quasi-periodic
oscillation (QPO) with the centroid frequency varying in the range of 4-12 Hz.
The QPO shows no correlation with the source flux, but becomes more prominent
at higher energies. This type of PDS bears resemblance to that of other black
hole candidates often observed in a so-called very high state, although the
origin of the observed QPO may be very different. The low-frequency red noise
has not been observed in the hard state, thus seems to be positively correlated
with the disk mass accretion rate which is presumably low in the hard state and
high in the soft state; in fact, it completely dominates the PDS in the soft
state. In the framework of thermalComptonization models, Cui et al. (see
astro-ph/9610071 and astro-ph/9610072) speculated that the difference in the
observed spectral and timing properties between the hard and soft states is due
to the presence of a ``fluctuating'' Comptonizing corona during the transition.
Here we present the measured hard X-ray time lags and coherence functions
between various energy bands, and show that the results strongly support such a
scenario.

using tight-binding molecular dynamics. The first network corresponds to the
traditional, amorphous, Polk-type, network, randomly decorated with Ga and As

of the useful tools for relating different points on the plot is vertical
dimensional reduction, which is possible if periodic arrays of p-brane solitons
can be constructed. This is straightforward for extremal p-branes, since the
no-force condition allows arbitrary multi-centre solutions to be constructed in
terms of a general harmonic function on the transverse space. This has also
been shown to be possible in the special case of non-extremal black holes in
D=4 arrayed along an axis. In this paper, we extend previous results to include
multi-scalar black holes, and dyonic black holes. We also consider their
oxidation to higher dimensions, and we discuss general procedures for
constructing the solutions, and studying their symmetries.

the tight binding Hamiltonians associated with the GCQTM for energies both
above and below the potential height. For parameters and potentials in the
electron region, the LR fluctuates rapidly between very high and very low
values as a function of momentum. The rapidity and extent of the fluctuations
increases rapidly with increasing N. For N=18, the largest value considered,
the LR shows good transmission probability as a function of momentum with
numerous holes of very high LR values present. This is true for energies above

this explanation is correct, it provides a dramatic illustration of the effects
