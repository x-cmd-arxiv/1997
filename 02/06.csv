examples of weight 3 cusp forms. Consequently we find many abelian coverings of
low degree of the moduli space ${\Cal A}_t$ of (1,t)-polarized abelian surfaces

applications for the Picard group of the moduli stack ${\underline{\Cal A}}_t$.
Finally we prove non-existence theorems for low weight modular forms. As one of
our main results we obtain the theorem that the maximal abelian cover ${\Cal

(about 10 TeV) in the supernova remnant IC 443. X-ray imaging spectroscopy with
ASCA reveals two regions of particularly hard emission: an unresolved source
embedded in an extended emission region, and a ridge of emission coincident
with the southeastern rim. Both features are located on part of the radio shell
where the shock wave is interacting with molecular gas, and together they
account for a majority of the emission at 7 keV. Though we would not have
noticed it a priori, the unresolved feature is coincident with one resolved by
the ROSAT HRI. Because this feature overlaps a unique region of flat radio
spectral index (alpha < 0.24), has about equal light-crossing and synchrotron
loss times, and a power law spectrum with a spectral index of 2, we conclude
that the hard X-ray feature is synchrotron radiation from a site of enhanced
particle acceleration. Evidence against a plerion includes a lack of observed
periodicity (the pulsed fraction upper limit is 33%), the spectral similarity
with the more extended hard region, the location of the source outside the 95%
error circle of the nearby EGRET source, the fact that it is nestled in a bend
in the molecular cloud ring with which IC 443 is interacting, and the
requirement of an extremely high transverse velocity (>5,000 km/s). We conclude
that the anomalous feature is most likely tracing enhanced particle
acceleration by shocks that are formed as the supernova blast wave impacts the
ring of molecular clouds.

  The merging rates of relativistic binary stars (NS+NS, NS+BH, BH+BH)
dependence on the kick velocity is specially adresed. The BH+BH merging is
shown to occur, depending on parameters of BH formation, at a rate of one per
200,000 -- 500,000 years in a Milky Way type galaxy. The NS+NS merging rate
$R_{ns}$ is found to be 1 per \sim 3,000 years for zero recoil, and decrease to
one per 10,000 years even for the highest kick velocities of 400 km/s.
  That the merging rates derived from evolutionary calculations are by two
order of magnitude higher than those based on binary pulsar statistics only, is
suggested to be due to the fact that the observable binary pulsars in pairs
with NS form only a fraction of the total number of binary NS systems. The
expected detection rate of binary BH by a LIGO-type gravitational wave detector
comparable with and even higher than the binary NS merging rate for a wide

  The typing process is modeled as a noisy channel where Hidden Markov Models
are used to model the channel characteristics. Weak statistical language models
are used to predict what sentences are likely to be transmitted through the
channel. These components are held together in the Token Passing framework
which provides the desired tight coupling between orthographic pattern matching
and linguistic expectation.
  The system, CTR (Connected Text Recognition), has been tested on two corpora
derived from two different applications, a natural language dialogue system and
a transcription typing scenario. Experiments show that CTR can automatically
correct a considerable portion of the errors in the test sets without
introducing too much noise. The segmentation error correction rate is virtually
faultless.

observe a strong dependence of the transmission line shape and peak height on
the period of the grating, i.e. on the wave vector transfer from the diffracted
beams to the collective intersubband resonance. It is shown that the line shape
transforms with increasing grating period from a Lorentzian into a strongly

transfer-matrix method of local optics and apply the modal-expansion method to
calculate the influence of the grating. The optically uniaxial
quasi-two-dimensional electron gas is described in the long-wavelength limit of
the random-phase approximation by a local dielectric tensor, which includes
size quantization effects. Our theory reproduces excellently the experimental

nonstandard potential for a scalar field that reproduces the effect of the
worldsheet instantons. As has been previously pointed out the topological
charge Q of the gauge field can be detected by an Anharonov-Bohm type
experiment using quantum strings; the classical scalar hair of the solutions
here is a classical detection of Q. ADM mass, dilaton charge and Hawking
temperature are calculated and compared with the known cases when appropriate.
We discuss why these solutions do not violate the no-hair theorems and show
that, for sufficiently small interaction coupling, the solutions are stable
under linear time dependent perturbations.

parameterizations of Bose-Einstein correlations of identical particles emitted
from purely chaotic hadron sources formed by relativistic heavy ion collisions.
We find that this additional parameter in the so-called Bertsch
parameterization can be expressed in terms of a linear ``out-longitudinal''
correlation coefficient for emission of bosons and two already known ``radius''
parameters, $R_l$ and $R_o$. The linear correlation coefficient is of
kinematical nature and can be used to determine the widths of longitudinal
momentum distributions.

the structure function of a nucleon and of a nucleus, composed of
point-nucleons. In computations of the latter we include Final State
Interactions and results for $F_2^A$ are compared with a few directly measured
data on C and Fe. The above $F_i^A$ are primarily used for predictions of the
TJNAF 89-008 inclusive scattering experiment of 4 GeV electrons on various
targets. Those cover a broad angular, and correspondingly wide $x,Q^2$ range,
where the nucleon-inelastic part dominates large sections of the covered
kinematics. The same model has been applied to the study of hitherto neglected
Final State Interaction effects in the nuclear component in EMC ratios in the
region $0.85\lesssim x\lesssim 0.25$.

is reconsidered. The TRV $\rho$-exchange interaction on which recent analyses
of measurements are based is necessarily also charge-symmetry breaking (CSB).
Limits on its strength $\bar{g}_\rho$ relative to regular $\rho$-exchange are
extracted from recent CSB experiments in neutron-proton scattering. The result
$\bar{g}_\rho\le 6.7\times 10^{-3}$ (95% CL) is considerably lower than limits
inferred from direct TRV tests in nuclear processes. Properties of
$a_1$-exchange and limit imposed by the neutron EDM are briefly discussed.

system can be integrated to a knot invariant. We discuss four different
approaches to the proof of this theorem: a topological/combinatorial approach
following M. Hutchings, a geometrical approach following Kontsevich, an
algebraic approach following Drinfel'd's theory of associators, and a physical
approach coming from the Chern-Simons quantum field theory. Each of these
approaches is unsatisfactory in one way or another, and hence we argue that we
still don't really understand the fundamental theorem of Vassiliev invariants.
