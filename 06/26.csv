observation by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on February
14--28, 1995. The light curves in the R and B bands show fast fluctuations
superimposed on longer timescale variations. The color index correlates with
intensity during the rapid flares (the spectrum is flatter when the flux is
higher), but it is rather insensitive to the long term trends. Over the 5 month
observational period the light curve shows an overall brightening of about 1
mag followed by a fast decline. The EGRET pointing covers part of the very
bright phase (V about 13.2) and the initial decline. An ultraviolet spectrum
was also obtained with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) (1200-3000

redshifts for HDF galaxies with J<23.5. We demonstrate that incorporating the
near-infrared data reduces the uncertainty in the estimated redshifts by
approximately 40% and is required to remove systematic uncertainties within the
redshift range 1<z<2. Utilizing these photometric redshifts, we determine the
evolution of the comoving ultraviolet (2800 A) luminosity density (presumed to
be proportional to the global star formation rate) from a redshift of z=0.5 to
z=2. We find that the global star formation rate increases rapidly with
redshift, rising by a factor of 12 from a redshift of zero to a peak at z~1.5.
For redshifts beyond 1.5, it decreases monotonically. Our measures of the star
formation rate are consistent with those found by Lilly et al. (1996) from the
CFRS at z<1, and by Madau et al. (1996) from Lyman break galaxies at z > 2, and
bridge the redshift gap between those two samples. The overall star formation

the data always favor isotropic models for the distribution of observed
polarizations over counterparts that have a cosmological anisotropy of the type
advocated in the earlier study. Although anisotropic models are not completely
ruled out, the data put strong lower limits on the length scale $\lambda$ (in
units of the Hubble length) associated with the anisotropy; the lower limits of
95% credible regions for $\lambda$ lie between 0.43 and 0.62 in all anisotropic
models we studied, values several times larger than the best-fit value of
$\lambda \approx 0.1$ found in the earlier study. The length scale is not
constrained from above. The vast majority of sources in the data are at
distances closer than 0.4 Hubble lengths (corresponding to a redshift of
$\approx$0.8); the results are thus consistent with there being no significant
anisotropy on the length scale probed by these data.

gaussian profiles rather than a single exponential profile is found to be a
better representation of the observed intensity profiles in the two bands. The
gaussian component, which we show is not due to the effects of limited
beam-resolution, contains more than 60% of the total flux in majority of the
galaxies. The dominance of the gaussian component suggests that the nuclear
star forming regions and the bulge stars are more important contributors to the
emission in the two bands, rather than the outer exponential stellar disks. The
RC profile is flatter compared to the FIR profile, resulting in a decrease of
their ratio, Q60, away from the center. However, the Q60 increases in the
extreme outer parts, where the dispersion in the FIR and RC correlation is also
higher than in the central regions. The global Q60 and its dispersion match
those in the inner parts of the galaxies. These results imply that the observed
tight correlation in the global quantities reflects processes in the inner
regions only where OB stars and the associated Type II supernovae control the
FIR and RC emission. In the outer parts heating of very small dust grains by
the old disk stars provides a secondary component in the FIR emission, without
associated RC emission. The edge-on galaxy NGC3079 shows extended FIR and RC

capabilities of the diffuse interstellar radiation field (ISRF), based on
Desert et al. model, are investigated in 13 of the sample galaxies. In general,
the temperature of the warm dust decreases away from the center, reaches a
minimum value at the mid-disk and increases again in the outer parts of
galaxies. Heating a mixture of small and big grains by the ISRF is able to
explain the observed behavior qualitatively. However, ultraviolet photons from
recent star formation events are necessary for a detailed matching of the warm
dust temperature profiles. Very small grains contribute typically more than 50%
to the observed flux at 60 micron beyond half the disk radius in galaxies.
Optical depth profiles, derived from the observed 60 micron and warm dust
temperature profiles, peak at or close to the galactic center. In 13 of the
galaxies, where dust temperature profiles are modeled, we obtain gas-to-dust
mass ratio profiles, after correction for the contaminating effects of very
small grains. The gas-to-dust mass ratio decreases by a factor of 8 from the
center to the optical isophotal radius, where the value approaches the local
galactic value. We demonstrate that the observed steep gradient is a result of
the over-estimation of the molecular mass, and can be flattened out to within a
factor of 2, if the molecular hydrogen mass (H2) is recomputed assuming a
metallicity dependent conversion factor from CO intensity to H2 column density.
The flattened radial profiles indicate a global gas-to-dust ratio of around
300, which is within a factor of two of the local galactic value.

verify theoretical predictions that the lines are thermalized in the BLR. 2. A
weak associated UV absorption system is detected in N~V, and possibly also in C

dispersion <300 km/s. 3. Lines from ions of increasing ionization level show
increasing excess blue wing flux, and an increasing line peak velocity shift,
reaching a maximum blueshift of about 2000 km/s for He II 1640. This may
indicate an out-flowing component in the BLR, where the ionization level
increases with velocity, and which is visible only in the approaching
direction. The highest velocity part of this outflow may produce the associated
UV absorption system. 4. The small C III] 1909 EW, and the small C III]
1909/Lya and C III] 1909/Si III] 1892 flux ratios indicate a typical BLR
density of 10^11, i.e. about an order of magnitude larger than implied by C

the EW and doublet ratio of the Al III 1857 doublet. 5. Prominent Fe II UV 191
emission is seen, together with weaker line emission at 1294 and 1871 A. These
three features have been proposed as evidence for significant Lya pumping of

observed up to a temperature at least twice that of the magnetic transition,
T_m = 110.5 K. On cooling through T_m, the wave vector \epsilon, equal to half
the charge-stripe density within an NiO(2) layer, jumps discontinuously from
1/3 to 0.2944. It continues to decrease with further cooling, showing several
lock-in transitions on the way down to low temperature. To explain the observed
lock-ins, a model is proposed in which each charge stripe is centered on either
a row of Ni or a row of O ions. The model is shown to be consistent with the
l-dependence of the magnetic peak intensities and with the relative intensities
of the higher-order magnetic satellites. Analysis of the latter also provides
evidence that the magnetic domain walls (charge stripes) are relatively narrow.
In combination with a recent study of magnetic-field-induced effects, we find
that the charge stripes are all O-centered at T>T_m, with a shift towards Ni
centering at T<T_m. Inferences concerning the competing interactions

of charge within the stripes are discussed.

U-duality, which controls the non-perturbative behavior of the theory. Under
SL(2,Z) the supercharges are doublets, implying that the bosonic charges would
be singlets or triplets. However, among the bosonic charges there are doublet
strings and doublet fivebranes which are in conflict with the doublet property
of the supercharges. It is shown that the conflict is resolved by structure
constants that depend on moduli, such as the tau parameter, which transform
under the same SL(2,Z). The resulting superalgebra encodes the non-perturbative
duality properties of the theory and is valid for any value of the string
coupling constant. The usefulness of the formalism is illustrated by applying
it to purely algebraic computations of the tension of (p,q) strings, and the
mass and entropy of extremal blackholes constructed from D-1-branes and
D-5-branes. In the latter case the non-perturbative coupling dependence of the
BPS mass and metric is computed for the first time in this paper. It is further
argued that the moduli dependence of the superalgebra provides hints for four
more dimensions beyond ten, such that the superalgebra is embedded in a
fundamental theory which would be covariant under SO(11,3). An outline is given

the one-loop vacuum fluctuations in a curved background by a direct local

First the method is checked in the case of a conformally coupled massless field
in the static Einstein universe where all hypotheses initially requested by the
method hold true. Secondly, dropping the hypothesis of a closed manifold, the
method is checked in the open static Einstein universe. Finally, the method is
checked for a massless scalar field in the presence of a conical singularity in
the Euclidean manifold (i.e. Rindler spacetimes/ large mass black hole
manifold/cosmic string manifold). In all cases, a complete agreement with other
approaches is found. Concerning the last case in particular, the method is
proved to give rise to the stress tensor already got by the point-splitting
approach for every coupling with the curvature regardless of the presence of
the singular curvature. In the last case, comments on the measure employed in
the path integral, the use of the optical manifold and the different approaches

plasma cools much more rapidly resulting in shortened lifetime. The degree of
equilibration improves significantly for quarks and antiquarks but not so for

several different sets of effective interaction parameters, when we demand that
each of these sets places the virtual-state pole at its physical location.

energies from threshold up to 720 MeV. The elementary $\gamma N \to \eta N$
amplitude is constructed in the frame of a conventional isobar model. Effects
of final state interaction are investigated and their role in the cross section
as well as in polarization observables is found to be important. Inclusion of
such effects leads to a satisfactory agreement with experimental data in the
near threshold region. In addition, recent experimental results on the coherent
reaction $d(\gamma,\eta)d$ are discussed.

"nucl-th/9706073","Mohamed Slim Fayache","M.S.Fayache, L. Zamick, Y.Y. Sharon (Rutgers University)","Are There Low-Lying Intruder States in ^8Be?","11 pages, no figures",,,,"nucl-th",,"  We allow up to $4 \hbar\omega$ excitations in $^8Be$ relative to the basic
configuration $(0s)^4(0p)^4$ in order to see if there are low-lying intruder
states in $^8Be$. We use three interactions $-\chi Q \cdot Q, -\chi Q \cdot Q$
+ spin-orbit, and a realistic (x,y) interaction, where for $x=1,y=1$ one gets
values for the spin-orbit and tensor interactions which correspond closely to
those of a non-relativistic $G$ matrix such as Bonn A. For the three
interactions considered, if we allow up to $2 \hbar \omega$ excitations we get
the energy of the lowest $J=0^+$ intruder state to be at 32.1 MeV, 30.1 MeV and
33.8 MeV, respectively. If we allow up to $4 \hbar\omega$ excitations the
corresponding values are 26.5 MeV, 26.5 MeV and 28.7 MeV. We thus support the
statement made by E. Warburton in his 1986 $R$ matrix analysis of the
$\beta^{\mp}$-delayed alpha spectra from the decay of $^8Li$ and $^8B$ that
``satisfactory fits are obtained without introducing intruder states below
26-MeV excitations'' (Phys. Rev. C 33, 303(1986)). In $^{10}Be$ however, with
the first two ``$Q \cdot Q$'' interactions, we get (with up to $2 \hbar \omega$
excitations) low-lying intruder states at 9.7 MeV and 11.9 MeV respectively.
Thus the presence of low-lying intruder states in $^{10}Be$ (the $0^+_2$ state
at 6.179 MeV may or may not be an intruder) does not imply that there are
low-lying intruder states in $^8Be$.

indication of the central role played by time-dependent harmonic oscillators in
quantum mechanics. The utility of the known results for eigenvalue problem in
the solution of the dynamical equations of a class of time-dependent harmonic
