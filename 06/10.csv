content of galaxy clusters and groups, together with the optical luminosity,
mass and iron abundance of cluster galaxies. Several astrophysical inferences
are then drawn, including the evidence for rich clusters having evolved without
much baryon exchange with their surrondings, and having experienced very
similar star formation histories. Groups are much gas-poor compared to
clusters, and appear instead to have shed a major fraction of their original
cosmic share of baryons, which indicates that galaxy clusters cannot have
formed by assembling groups similar to the present day ones. It is argued that
this favors low-$\Omega$ universes, in which the growth of rich clusters is
virtually complete at high redshifts. It is also argued that elemental
abundance ratios in clusters are nearly solar, which is consistent with a
similar proportion of supernovae of Type Ia and Type II having enriched both
the solar neghborhood as well clusters as a whole. Much of the iron in clusters
appears to reside in the intracluster medium rather than inside galaxies. It
appears that the baryon to star conversion in clusters has been nearly as
efficient as currently adopted for the universe as a whole. Yet the metallicity
of the clusters is $\sim 5$ times higher than the global metallicity adopted
for the nearby universe. It is concluded that the intergalactic medium should
have a metallicity $\sim 1/3$ solar if stellar nucleosynthesis has proceeded in
stars within field galaxies with the same efficiency as in stars within
clusters of galaxies.

quadrupole moment of the companion gives rise to a precession of the binary
orbit. As a first approximation one can model the secular evolution caused by
this classical spin-orbit coupling by linear-in-time changes of the longitude
of periastron and the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit. This
simple representation of the precession of the orbit neglects two important
aspects of the orbital dynamics of a binary pulsar with an oblate companion.
First, the quasiperiodic effects along the orbit, due to the anisotropic
$1/r^3$ nature of the quadrupole potential. Secondly, the long-term secular
evolution of the binary orbit which leads to an evolution of the longitude of
periastron and the projected semi-major axis which is non-linear in time.
  In this paper a simple timing formula for binary radio pulsars with a
main-sequence star companion is presented which models the short-term secular
and most of the short-term periodic effects caused by the classical spin-orbit
coupling. I also give extensions of the timing formula which account for
long-term secular changes in the binary pulsar motion. It is shown that the
short-term periodic effects are important for the timing observations of the
binary pulsar PSR B1259--63. The long-term secular effects are likely to become
important in the next few years of timing observations of the binary pulsar PSR
J0045--7319. They could help to restrict or even determine the moments of
inertia of the companion star and thus probe its internal structure.
  Finally, I reinvestigate the spin-orbit precession of the binary pulsar PSR
J0045--7319 since the analysis given in the literature is based on an incorrect
expression for the precession of the longitude of periastron.

structures of the systems that give rise to the Lya forest span a wide range in
morphologies, depending on the density contrast. The absorption properties of
the forest clouds correlate strongly with those of the underlying physical
systems from which they arise. The highest column density systems (log N_HI >
15), correspond to highly overdense spheroidal structures, moderate column
density systems (13 < log N_HI < 14), correspond to filaments, and the lowest
density absorption systems originate from discrete fluctuations within
underdense regions a few megaparsecs across, cosmic minivoids. Most of the
intergalactic HeII opacity arises from these underdense regions. We are able to
account for the distribution of optical depths in our synthesized spectra
entirely by absorption due to discrete systems. We find that virtually all the
baryons in the simulation fragment into structures that we can identify with
discrete absorption lines, with at most 5% remaining in a smoothly distributed

times in galactic cooling flows, currently observed magnetic fields may result
from periods of intense turbulent field amplification that occurred in the

$p=1$. The case of the singular isothermal sphere ($p=2$) is not considered;
however $p=1$ has been shown observationally to be a good representation of the
density distribution in molecular cloud cores just before the beginning of
collapse. The collapse is studied with two independent numerical methods, an
SPH code with 200,000 particles, and a finite-difference code with nested grids
which give high spatial resolution in the inner regions. Although previous
numerical studies have indicated that such a power-law distribution would not
result in fragmentation into a binary system, both codes show, in contrast,
that multiple fragmentation does occur in the central regions of the protostar.
Thus the process of binary formation by fragmentation is shown to be consistent
with the fact that a large fraction of young stars are observed to be in binary

phenomena such as reference are coming to depend increasingly on annotated
language corpora. In preparing the corpora, it is important to evaluate the
reliability of the annotation, but methods for doing so have not been readily
available. In this report, I present a method for computing reliability of
coreference annotation. First I review a method for applying the information
retrieval metrics of recall and precision to coreference annotation proposed by
Marc Vilain and his collaborators. I show how this method makes it possible to
construct contingency tables for computing Cohen's Kappa, a familiar
reliability metric. By comparing recall and precision to reliability on the
same data sets, I also show that recall and precision can be misleadingly high.
Because Kappa factors out chance agreement among coders, it is a preferable
measure for developing annotated corpora where no pre-existing target
annotation exists.

shown that the electron-hole symmetry breaking may make the model
non-commutative and generate the assisted tunneling process which is, however,
too small itself to drive the system into the vicinity of the two-channel Kondo
fixed point. While these results are in qualitative agreement with those of
Moustakas and Fisher (Phys. Rev. B 51, 6908 (1995), ibid 53, 4300 (1996)) the
scaling equations turn out to be essentially different. We show that the main
reason for this difference is that the procedure for the elimination of the
high energy degrees of freedom used by Moustakas and Fisher leaves only the
free energy invariant, however, the couplings generated are not connected to
the dynamical properties in a straightforward way and should be interpreted
with care. These latter results might have important consequences in other
cases where the path integral technique is used to produce the scaling
equations and calculate physical quantities.

trigonometric potential of the Sutherland problem by a three-body one of a
similar form is shown to be exactly solvable. When written in appropriate
variables, its eigenfunctions can be expressed in terms of Jack symmetric
polynomials. The exact solvability of the problem is explained by a hidden
$sl(3,R)$ symmetry. A generalized Sutherland three-particle problem including
both two- and three-body trigonometric potentials and internal degrees of
freedom is then considered. It is analyzed in terms of three first-order
noncommuting differential-difference operators, which are constructed by
combining SUSYQM supercharges with the elements of the dihedral group~$D_6$.
Three alternative commuting operators are also introduced.

linear $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ $\sigma$-model is proposed. Besides the baryon
octet, the spin-0 and spin-1 nonets, a gluon condensate associated with broken
scale invariance is incorporated. The observed values for the vacuum masses of
the baryons and mesons are reproduced. In mean-field approximation, vector and
scalar interactions yield a saturating nuclear equation of state. We discuss
the difficulties and possibilities to construct a chiral invariant baryon-meson
interaction that leads to a realistic equation of state. It is found that a
coupling of the strange condensate to nucleons is needed to describe the
hyperon potentials correctly. The effective baryon masses and the appearance of
an abnormal phase of nearly massless nucleons at high densities are examined. A
nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry is considered, to retain a Yukawa-type
baryon-meson interaction and to establish a connection to the Walecka-model.

obtaining any particular set of data. The opposite approach, beginning with the
data and assigning a likelihood to any particular model, is explored here for
the case of points drawn randomly from a continuous probability distribution. A
scalar field theory is used to assign a likelihood over the space of
probability distributions. The most likely distribution may be calculated,
providing an estimate of the underlying distribution and a convenient graphical
representation of the raw data. Fluctuations around this maximum likelihood
estimate are characterized by a robust measure of goodness-of-fit. Its
distribution may be calculated by integrating over fluctuations. The resulting
method of data analysis has some advantages over conventional approaches.
