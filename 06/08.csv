NGC4941) with the Italian-Dutch satellite BeppoSAX. These are among the first
sources observed in a sample of 12 Seyfert2's which are being studied within
the BeppoSAX core program, in an effort to probe the putative torus at high
X-ray energies, calibrate an isotropic luminosity indicator for absorbed
nuclei, and determine the distribution of torus thicknesses, Nh. Both a Compton
thick spectrum, with a reflected power law and a large equivalent width iron
line, and a Compton thin spectrum, with the intrinsic power law transmitted
through a large column density absorber, provide acceptable fits to both
sources, with some preference for the latter model in the case of NGC4941. The
high initial detection rate in our program points to a large final X-ray
sample.

discussed in the context of limits on Lambda. Three separate routes to the
Hubble constant are considered: the measurement of time delays in
multiply-imaged quasars, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters, and
Cepheid-based extragalactic distances. Globular-cluster ages plus a new age
measurement based on radioactive dating of thorium in a metal-poor star are
briefly summarized. Many recent, independent dynamical measurements are
yielding a low value for the matter density (omega ~ 0.2 - 0.3). A wide range
of Hubble constant measurements appear to be converging in the range of 60-80
km/sec/Mpc. Particular attention is paid to sources of systematic error and the
assumptions that underlie many of the measurement methods.

possible fluorescent H_2 in photo-dissociation regions associated with M 43 and
NGC 1977. Neither the suspected outflows nor the fluorescent emission are seen
at the continuum wavelength of 2.14 microns which confirms their emission line
nature. Several of the new H_2 flows are associated with recently discovered
bipolar molecular outflows. However, the most prominent bipolar CO outflow from
the region (the MMS 8 flow) has no clear H_2 counterpart. Several H_2 flows
consist of chains of knots and compact bow shocks that likely trace highly
collimated protostellar jets. Our discovery of more than 80 individual H_2
emitting shocks demonstrate that outflows from young stars are churning this

that this is in general not the case for arbitrary coherent two-body states of
the mesons, and obtain conditions under which such a naive incoherent sum gives
the correct distributions. The analysis is based on the Weisskopf-Wigner
formalism, and applicable to the cases where there are more than two orthogonal
states that can mix to form a set of eigenstates of mass and decay rate.
