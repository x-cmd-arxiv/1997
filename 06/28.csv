relation. The HI linewidth in interacting galaxies is significantly broader
than the CO linewidth, and the HI to CO linewidth ratio is proportional to the
strength of interaction. This provides different distances to galaxies measured
by the Tully-Fisher relation with the CO and HI linewidths. Distances derived
from the HI linewidths are 62% larger than those derived from the CO linewidths
for strongly interacting galaxies, and 25% larger for weakly interacting
galaxies. We argue that the CO-line Tully-Fisher relation will be more reliable
to measure the distances of interacting galaxies as well as galaxies in rich
clusters.

additional Cepheid candidates have been identified and preliminary periods are
proposed. The new Cepheids allow the period-luminosity relation to be extended
one magnitude fainter. Apparent B, V, R, and I distance moduli have been
calculated. Combining the data at different wavelengths, and assuming a true
distance modulus of 18.50 mag for the LMC, we obtain for NGC 3109 a true
distance modulus $(m-M)_0=25.67\pm0.16$, corresponding to $1.36\pm0.10$ Mpc.
Adopting $E(B-V)=0.08$ for the LMC, the interstellar reddening for the Cepheids
in NGC 3109 is consistent with 0. A discussion on the possible implications of
this result is presented. A comparison of the period-color, period-amplitude,
and period-luminosity relations suggests similar properties for the Cepheids in
the LMC, NGC 3109, Sextans A, Sextans B, and IC 1613, though the uncertainties
in the main parameter determination are still unsatisfactorily high for a firm
conclusion on the universality of the period-luminosity relation.

Hilbert space, the Virasoro algebra, the string mode expansion, canonical
commutators and Schroedinger evolution of states, independent of the
assumptions of string theory and quantum theory. The usual properties of
dimensionful fields imply an infinite, projective tower of conformal weights
associated with the tangent space to scale-invariant spacetimes. Convergence
and measurability on this tangent tower are guaranteed using a scale-invariant
norm, restricted to conformally self-dual vectors. Maps on the resulting
Hilbert space are correspondingly restricted to semi-definite conformal weight.
We find the maximally- and minimally-commuting, complete Lie algebras of
definite-weight operators. The projective symmetry of the tower gives these
algebras central charges, giving the canonical commutator and quantum Virasoro
algebras, respectively. Using a continuous, m-parameter representation for
rank-m tower tensors, we show that the parallel transport equation for the
momentum vector of a particle is the Schroedinger equation, while the
associated definite-weight operators obey canonical commutation relations.
Generalizing to the set of integral curves of general timelike, self-dual
vector-valued weight maps gives a lifting such that the action of the curves
parallel transports arbitrary tower vectors. We prove that the full set of
Schroedinger-lifted integral curves of a general self-dual map gives an
immersion of its 2-dim parameter space into spacetime, inducing a Lorentzian
metric on the parameter space. The immersion is shown to satisfy the
variational equations of open string.
