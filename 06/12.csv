measurements rather evenly spread out over the course of a whole sunspot cycle
from September 1985 to August 1996. Almost all the data were obtained at the
2800-m level of Mauna Kea using the same telescope, same photomultiplier tube,
filters, and diaphragm, thus minimizing various sources of systematic error and
allowing an estimate of the sources of random error. The yearly V-band averages
of observed sky brightness ranged from 21.287 to 21.906 magnitudes per square
arc second. The color of the sky is $B-V$ = 0.930 and does not change
discernibly over the course of the sunspot cycle. After correcting the V-band
data to the zenith, we find that the airglow component varied a factor of 4.5
over the course of the solar cycle. Once the 11-year solar cycle effect is
removed from the data, the most significant contribution to the scatter of
individual data points appears to be the short term variations on time scales
of tens of minutes like those observed by the Whole Earth Telescope project.

M=(2.5+/-0.4) x 10^6 solar masses which makes it an excellent black hole
candidate. Observations of stellar winds and other gas flows in its vicinity
suggest a mass accretion rate approximately few x 10^{-6} solar masses per
year. However, such an accretion rate would imply a luminosity > 10^{40} erg/s
if the radiative efficiency is the usual 10 percent, whereas observations
indicate a bolometric luminosity <10^{37} erg/s. The spectrum of Sgr A* is
unusual, with emission extending over many decades of wavelength. We present a
model of Sgr A* which is based on a two-temperature optically-thin
advection-dominated accretion flow. The model is consistent with the estimated
mass and accretion rate, and fits the observed fluxes in the cm/mm and X-ray
bands as well as upper limits in the sub-mm and infrared bands; the fit is less
good in the radio below 86 GHz and in gamma-rays above 100 MeV. The very low
luminosity of Sgr A* is explained naturally in the model by means of advection.
Most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected into the central mass by
the accreting gas, and therefore the radiative efficiency is extremely low,
approximately 5 x 10^{-6}. A critical element of the model is the presence of
an event horizon at the center which swallows the advected energy. The success
of the model could thus be viewed as confirmation that Sgr A* is a black hole.

apply this to galaxies of different morphological types. We show that this
simplified model is consistent with the observed WDMF of Bergeron et al. (1992)
for the solar neighborhood. Our simple models predict that WDMF variations can
produce a range of more than 1.8 mag in M$_B$(SN Ia), which is comparable to
the observed value using the data of Phillips (1993) and van den Bergh (1996).
We also predict a galaxy type dependence of M$_B$(SN Ia) under standard
assumptions of the star formation history in these galaxies and show that
M$_B$(SN Ia) can evolve with redshift. In principle both evolutionary and
galaxy type corrections should be applied to recover the intrinsic range of
M$_B$(SN Ia) from the observed values. Our current inadequate knowledge of the
star formation history of galaxies coupled with poor physical understanding of
the SN Ia mechanism makes the reliable estimation of these corrections both
difficult and controversial. The predictions of our models combined with the
observed galaxy and redshift correlations may have the power to discriminate
between the Chandrasekhar and the sub-Chandrasekhar progenitor scenarios for
SNe Ia.

have explored a variety of chemical evolution models including infall of

identifying models with large D-destruction which are consistent with the

confronted with data we reconfirm that only modest destruction of deuterium

which takes into account the low abundance of I129 and the high abundance of
Hf182 in the early solar nebula. The lifetime of Hf182 associates the events in
case H with the most common Type II supernovae. These events would be mainly
responsible for the r-process nuclei near and above A=195. They would also make
a significant amount of the nuclei between A=130 and 195, including Hf182, but
very little I129. In order to match the solar r-process abundance pattern and
to satisfy the I129 and Hf182 constraints, the events in case L, which would
make the r-process nuclei near A=130 and the bulk of those between A=130 and

material in each event. We speculate that the usual neutron star remnants, and

of other r-process material terminated by black hole formation during the

studied in the semi-entropic model. We introduce a global energy measure
defined by the variance of the quasilattice points in the orthogonal space. The
internal energy, the specific heat, the configuration entropy and the sheet
magnetization (as defined by Dotera and Steinhardt [Phys.Rev.Lett. 72 (1994)
1670]) have been calculated. The specific heat shows a Schottky anomaly which
might indicate a phase transition from an ordered quasicrystal to a random
tiling. But the divergence with the sample size as well as the divergence of
the susceptibility are too small to pinpoint the phase transition conclusively.
The self-diffusion coefficients closely follow an Arrhenius law, but show
plateaus at intermediate temperature ranges which are explained by energy
barriers between different tiling configurations due to the harmonic energy
measure. There exists a correlation between the temperature behavior of the
self-diffusion coefficient and the frequency of vertices which are able to flip
(simpletons). Furthermore we demonstrate that the radial distribution function
and the radial structure factor only depend slightly on the random tiling
configuration. Hence, radially symmetric pair potentials lead to an energetical
equidistribution of all configurations of a canonical random tiling ensemble
and do not enforce matching rules.

model. The value extracted for the strong interaction coupling constant
\alpha_s(mZ) agrees well with determinations in other areas. New constraints on
the universal parameters S, T and U are obtained from the updated measurements.
No signal of new physics is found in the S,T,U analysis once the SM
contributions with mt \sim 175GeV and those of not a too heavy Higgs boson are
accounted for. The naive QCD-like technicolor model is now ruled out at the
99%CL even for the minimal model with SU(2)_{TC}. In the absence of a
significant new physics effect in the electroweak observables, constraints on
masses of the top quark, mt, and Higgs boson, mH, are derived as a function of
\alpha_s and the QED effective coupling $\bar{\alpha}(m_Z^2)$. The preferred
range of mH depends rather strongly on the actual value of mt: mH<360 GeV for
mt=170GeV, while mH>130GeV for mt=180GeV at 95%CL. Prospects due to forthcoming
improved measurements of asymmetries, the mass of the weak boson W mW, mt and

stringent bounds on tan(beta)/m_H. There are currently rather large theoretical
uncertainties in the q^2 distribution, but these may be significantly reduced
by future measurements of the analogous distribution for B \to D(e,mu)\bar{nu}.
We estimate that this reduction in the theoretical uncertainties would
eventually (i.e., with sufficient data) allow one to push the upper bound on
tan(beta)/m_H down to about 0.06 GeV^{-1}. This would represent an improvement
on the current bound by about a factor of 7. We then apply the method of
optimized observables which allows us to estimate the reach of an experiment

geometrization of Hamiltonian dynamics is then used to introduce other relevant

strong coupling dynamics of N=1 theory with SU(N_c) gauge group and N_f quarks.

deformation space of the brane configuration and compare it with the moduli
