cluster such as the central stellar cluster at the Galactic center, where many
stars possess strong stellar winds, should result in collisions of those winds.
The wind collisions in the dense stellar core at the Galactic center would
result in production of strong X-ray flares with the rate of $\sim 10^{-4}~
(N_w/10^3)^2 / yr$ and duration of $\sim 1$ week, where $N_w$ is the number of
the wind producing stars in the core. Presence of a massive black hole would
enhance the stellar density around it and would make collisions of the winds in

The consequent increase of the scattering opacity lowers the Eddington limit
and this, in turn, may drive a dynamical instability if the accretion
luminosity is large enough, ultimately producing a rapid expulsion of the
envelope. If ``hot'' states are indeed accessible, this mechanism could give
rise to transient phenomena in hard X--rays of potential great astrophysical

examine the suggestion that rapidly rotating large disks are the only viable
explanation for the characteristic observed asymmetric profiles of low
ionization absorption lines. We demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations of
galaxy formation in a cosmological context that irregular protogalactic clumps
can reproduce the observed velocity width distribution and asymmetries of the
absorption profiles equally well. The velocity broadening in the simulated
clumps is due to a mixture of rotation, random motions, infall and merging. The
observed velocity width correlates with the virial velocity of the dark matter
halo of the forming protogalactic clump (v_{wid} ~ 0.6 times v_{vir} for the
median values with a large scatter of order a factor two between different
lines-of-sight). The typical virial velocity of the halos required to give rise
to the DLAS population is about 100 km/s and most standard hierarchical
structure formation scenarios can easily account even for the largest observed
velocity widths. We conclude that the evidence that DLAS at high redshift are
related to large rapidly rotating disks with v_circ >= 200 km/s is not
compelling.

increase is strong for early-type spiral galaxies and very small for late
types. We argue that it can be due to the presence of thick discs with scale
lengths larger than the galaxy's main disc. Finally we discuss the
colour-magnitude relation in I-K for spiral galaxies. We find that it is a
tight relation, for which the scatter is similar to the observational

was to determine the variability properties of this object on very short time
scales in several photometric bands. We detected variability on time scales as
short as 15 min. The Fourier properties of the light curves have been
investigated using structure function analysis. The power spectra are well
described by a power-law with an index -2.4. It is compatible with the index
found in the X-ray domain. The value of this index shows that the light curves
cannot be generated by a sum of exponential pulses. Using historical data, we
find that the longest time scale of variability in the optical domain lies
between 10 and 40 days. We find a strong correlation between flux and spectral
index, which we interpret as the signature of an underlying constant component.
As a result we do not find evidence of spectral variation for the active
nucleus in the optical domain. A lag has been found between the light curves in
different optical bands. The short-wavelength light curves lead the
long-wavelength ones. The amplitude of the lag is about 40 min for a factor 2
in wavelength. Our results are compared with predictions from different models.
None of them can explain naturally the set of results obtained with this
campaign, but we bring out some clues for the origin of the variability.

barely attenuated even in the midplane of the disk and produce chemically
active ions such as He$^+$ and H$_{3}^+$. Through reactions with these ions CO

upon approach of the critical point in two-dimensional spin systems with an
interaction range that was varied over nearly two orders of magnitude. The full
crossover from classical to Ising-like critical behavior, spanning several
decades in the reduced temperature, could be observed. Our results convincingly
show that the effective susceptibility exponent gamma_eff changes
nonmonotonically from its classical to its Ising value when approaching the
critical point in the ordered phase. In the disordered phase the behavior is
monotonic. Furthermore the hypothesis that the crossover function is universal
is supported.

local, partial density of states of the two mesoscopic conductors. We present
expressions for the partial density of states in terms of functional
derivatives of the scattering matrix with respect to the local potential and in
terms of wave functions. We discuss voltage measurements and resistance
measurements in the transport state of conductors. We illustrate the theory for

the secular stability of a fully general relativistic, rigidly rotating neutron
star that is near marginal stability, protecting it against gravitational
collapse. This stabilization is shown to result from the simple fact that the
energy $\delta M(Q,R)$ required to raise a tide on such a star, divided by the
square of the tide's quadrupole moment $Q$, is a decreasing function of the
star's radius $R$, $(d/dR)[\delta M(Q,R)/Q^2]<0$ (where, as $R$ changes, the
star's structure is changed in accord with the star's fundamental mode of
radial oscillation). If $(d/dR)[\delta M(Q,R)/Q^2]$ were positive, the tidal
coupling would destabilize the star. As an application, a rigidly rotating,
marginally secularly stable neutron star in an inspiraling binary system will
be protected against secular collapse, and against dynamical collapse, by tidal
interaction with its companion. The ``local-asymptotic-rest-frame'' tools used

neutron stars and black holes interacting with an external environment. As a

reactions and its impact on the kaon transverse flow and the kaon azimuthal
distribution are investigated within the framework of QMD (Quantum Molecular
Dynamics) model. The Coulomb interaction is found to tend to draw the flow of
kaons away from that of nucleons and lead to a more isotropic azimuthal
distribution of kaons in the target rapidity region. The recent FOPI data have
been analyzed by taking into accout both the Coulomb interaction and a kaon
in-medium potential of the strong interaction. It is found that both the
calculated kaon flows with only the Coulomb interaction and with both the
Coulomb interaction and the strong potential agree within the error bars with
the data. The kaon azimuthal distribution exhibits asymmetries of similar
magnitude in both theoretical approaches. This means, the inclusion of the
Coulomb potential makes it more difficult to extract information of the kaon
mean field potential in nuclear matter from the kaon flow and azimuthal
distribution data.

Rayleigh-Benard convection, based on the generalized Swift-Hohenberg model. We
apply a random phase approximation to STC and conjecture a scaling form for the
structure factor $S(k)$ with respect to the correlation length $\xi_2$. We
hence obtain analytical results for the time-averaged convective current $J$
and the time-averaged vorticity current $\Omega$. We also define power-law
behaviors such as $J \sim \epsilon^\mu$, $\Omega \sim \epsilon^\lambda$ and
$\xi_2 \sim \epsilon^{-\nu}$, where $\epsilon$ is the control parameter. We
find from our theory that $\mu = 1$, $\nu \ge 1/2$ and $\lambda = 2 \mu + \nu$
for phase turbulence and that $\mu = 1$, $\nu \ge 1/2$ and $\lambda = 2 \mu + 2
\nu$ for spiral-defect chaos. These predictions, together with the scaling
conjecture for $S(k)$, are confirmed by our numerical results. Finally we
suggest that Porod's law, $S(k) \sim 1/\xi_2 k^3$ for large $k$, might be valid
in STC.

probability of a non-relativistic particle crossing $x=0$ during an interval of
time. For a system consisting of a single non-relativistic particle, histories
coarse-grained according to whether or not they pass through spacetime regions
are generally not decoherent, except for very special initial states, and thus
probabilities cannot be assigned. Decoherence may, however, be achieved by
coupling the particle to an environment consisting of a set of harmonic
oscillators in a thermal bath. Probabilities for spacetime coarse grainings are
thus calculated by considering restricted density operator propagators of the
quantum Brownian motion model. We also show how to achieve decoherence by
replicating the system $N$ times and then projecting onto the number density of
particles that cross during a given time interval, and this gives an
alternative expression for the crossing probability. The latter approach shows
that the relative frequency for histories is approximately decoherent for
sufficiently large $N$, a result related to the Finkelstein-Graham-Hartle
theorem.
