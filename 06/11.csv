  Proceedings of the ""Hipparcos Venice'97 Symposium"", ESA SP-402",,,"SAAO-PDOC 1352","astro-ph",,"  A summary is given of an analysis of the Hipparcos trigonometrical parallaxes
and proper motions of classical Cepheids. It is possible for the first time to
derive zero-points for the period-luminosity and period-luminosity-colour
relations from parallaxes alone, avoiding the problems of less direct methods.
The results imply an increase of 8 to 10 percent in the extragalactic distance
scale based on Cepheids. The proper motions are used to derive the constants of
galactic rotation. Comparison with radial velocity data leads to a confirmation
of the Cepheid distance scale derived from the parallaxes and indicates a
kinematic distance to the galactic centre of 8.5 +/- 0.5 kpc. From the new
Cepheid distances to the LMC and M31, the absolute magnitude of RR Lyrae
variables in metal-poor globular clusters is derived. Applying this to data on
metal-poor clusters in our own Galaxy leads to an age of about 11 Gyr for these
clusters, considerably less than previously thought. Other evidence from
Hipparcos on these matters is briefly reviewed and it is suggested that the
Cepheid results currently provide the most reliable scale on which to base
distances and ages.

We use an identical subset of particles from the initial conditions for a

P$^3$M and Tree code runs. We investigate the effect of mass resolution (the
mean interparticle separation) since most ``high resolution'' codes only have
high resolution in gravitational force. The phase-insensitive two--point
statistics, such as the power spectrum (autocorrelation) are somewhat affected
by these variations, but phase-sensitive statistics show greater differences.
Results converge at the mean interparticle separation scale of the lowest
mass-resolution code. As more particles are added, but the force resolution is
held constant, the P$^3$M and the Tree runs agree more and more strongly with
each other and with the PM run which had the same initial conditions. This
shows high particle density is necessary for correct time evolution, since many
different results cannot all be correct. However, they do not so converge to a
PM run which continued the fluctuations to small scales. Our results show that
ignoring them is a major source of error on comoving scales of the missing
wavelengths. This can be resolved by putting in a high particle density. Since
the codes never agree well on scales below the mean comoving interparticle
separation, we find little justification for quantitative predictions on this
scale. Some measures vary by 50%, but others can be off by a factor of three or
more. Our results suggest possible problems with the density of galaxy halos,
formation of early generation objects such as QSO absorber clouds, etc.

scenario is characterized by two thermodynamical conditions: (1) The primordial
perturbations originate in the epoch when the inflationary universe contains a
thermalized heat bath. (2) The perturbations of the inflationary scalar field
are given by the fluctuation-dissipation relation. We show that the spectrum of
the primordial perturbations is of power law, but tilted, and there is a
relation between the amplitude and the index of the power spectrum. Aside from
the mass scale of the inflation, the amplitude-index relation does not depend
on other parameters like $g$-factor. These results are found to be well
consistent with observations of the temperature fluctuations of cosmic
microwave background if the mass scale of the inflation is about $10^{15}$ GeV.
Instead of the purely adiabatic case, the consequent density perturbation is an
admixture of adiabatic and isocurvature one. Therefore, the detection of
super-Hubble suppression of the spectrum would be effective for further
discrimination between the thermally originated models and others.

clusters of galaxies has been recognized for over a decade and a half, but the
physical reason for this connection remains unclear. Here we present deep
optical spectra of the nebula in Abell 2597, one of the nearest strong
cooling-flow clusters. These spectra reveal the density, temperature, and metal
abundances of the line-emitting gas. The abundances are roughly half-solar, and
dust produces an extinction of at least a magnitude in V. The absence of [O
III] 4363 emission rules out shocks as a major ionizing mechanism, and the
weakness of He II 4686 rules out a hard ionizing source, such as an active
galactic nucleus or cooling intracluster gas. Hot stars are therefore the best
candidate for producing the ionization. However, even the hottest O stars
cannot power a nebula as hot as the one we see. Some other nonionizing source
of heat appears to contribute a comparable amount of power. We show that the
energy flux from a confining medium can become important when the ionization
level of a nebula drops to the low levels seen in cooling-flow nebulae. We
suggest that this kind of phenomenon, in which energy fluxes from the
surrounding medium augment photoelectric heating, might be the common feature
underlying the diverse group of objects classified as LINERS.

to detect the Halpha emission originating in the partially ionized wind
outflowing at 200 km/s, that had been previously detected with the Hubble Space
Telescope. A shallow broadening of the Halpha line wings has been observed,
consistent with the existence of an expanding shell. The rotation curve shows
two dips at the same systemic velocity as the nucleus. At the positions of the
dips the Halpha line is clearly broadened with respect to the central core.
This broadening is produced by the outer layers of the expanding shell. From
the position of these dips we estimate the size of the shell to be around 20''
in diameter, with a corresponding kinematical age between 5 and 6 Myr. A
comparison of the Halpha and Ly_alpha profiles shows that Ly_alpha is
significantly broader than Halpha, with an additional emission in the red wing.

backscattered by the receding part of the expanding shell. These observations
outline the extremely high sensitivity of the Ly_alpha line to the structure

by a gap in the spin-excitation spectrum, which can be modeled at low energies
by that of Dirac fermions with a mass. In the presence of disorder these
systems can still be described by a Dirac fermion model, but with a random
mass. Some peculiar properties, like the Dyson singularity in the density of
states, are well known and attributed to creation of low-energy states due to
the disorder. We take one step further and study single-particle correlations
by means of Berezinskii's diagram technique. We find that, at low energy
$\epsilon$, the single-particle Green function decays in real space like
$G(x,\epsilon) \propto (1/x)^{3/2}$. It follows that at these energies the
correlations in the disordered system are strong -- even stronger than in the
pure system without the gap. Additionally, we study the effects of boundaries
on the local density of states. We find that the latter is logarithmically (in
the energy) enhanced close to the boundary. This enhancement decays into the
bulk as $1/\sqrt{x}$ and the density of states saturates to its bulk value on
the scale $L_\epsilon \propto \ln^2 (1/\epsilon)$. This scale is different from
the Thouless localization length $\lambda_\epsilon\propto\ln (1/\epsilon)$. We
also discuss some implications of these results for the spin systems and their
relation to the investigations based on real-space renormalization group

on, are solved with the aid of Wilson's momentum shell renormalization group.
The method is illustrated by calculating the non-equilibrium dynamics of the

temperature its modulation on the sublattices gives rise to two Bragg peaks in
the structure factor, and a known expression for the algebraic decay of
correlations enables us to examine the form of the diffusive scattering. We do
so by means of a comparison between exact results and data calculated using
standard Monte Carlo techniques. At non-zero temperatures the finite
correlation length alters this form, and we account for the change by proposing
a generalisation of the zero temperature pair correlation function. The size
dependence of our simulation data is investigated through a novel finite-size
scaling analysis where t = exp(-2/T) is used as the temperature parameter.

calculated from the magnetisation jumps using a Clausius-Clapeyron-type

1.5kB per flux-line per CuO layer near Tc. This is considerably larger than

structure of the vertically adapted frame bundle admits vector-valued field

can define a Poisson bracket on the field observables. We show that the linear

Higgs doublets in a general framework of the Standard Model with two Higgs
doublets (2HDM ``type III''). In the model, the neutral-Higgs-mediated
flavor-changing neutral currents are allowed but are assumed to be reasonably
suppressed at low energies. The popular ``type II'' and ``type I'' models are
just special cases of this framework. We also present a numerical example for
the RGE flow of Yukawa coupling parameters and masses of quarks. Detailed
investigation, through RGE's, of connection between the low energy and the high
energy structure of these 2HDM's would give us some additional insights into
the viability of such frameworks, i.e., it would tell us for which choices of
phenomenologically acceptable values of low energy parameters such frameworks
can be regarded as reasonably natural (without excessive changes in the
parameter structure as energy of probes increases over a wide range).
Furthermore, such analyses could provide us with possible signals of new
physics at high energies.

renormalization. We contrast physical results obtained using dimensional

dimensional regularization fails to reproduce the results obtained using cutoff
regularization. First we consider a delta-function potential in arbitrary space
dimensions. Using cutoff regularization we show that for $d \ge 4$ the
renormalized scattering amplitude is trivial. In contrast, dimensional
regularization can yield a nontrivial scattering amplitude for odd dimensions
greater than or equal to five. We also consider a potential consisting of a
delta function plus the derivative-squared of a delta function in three
dimensions. We show that the renormalized scattering amplitudes obtained using
the two regularization schemes are different. Moreover we find that in the
cutoff-regulated calculation the effective range is necessarily negative in the
limit that the cutoff is taken to infinity. In contrast, in dimensional
regularization the effective range is unconstrained. We discuss how these
discrepancies arise from the dimensional regularization prescription that all
power-law divergences vanish. We argue that these results demonstrate that
dimensional regularization can fail in a non-perturbative setting.

an expansion in the mode amplitude $A(t)$. In the limit of weak instability,
i.e. $\gamma\to 0^+$ where $\gamma$ is the linear growth rate, the nonlinear
coefficients are singular and their singularities predict the dependence of
$A(t)$ on $\gamma$. Generically the scaling $|A(t)|=\gamma^{5/2}r(\gamma t)$ as
$\gamma\to 0^+$ is required to cancel the coefficient singularities to all
orders. This result predicts the electric field scaling $|E_k|\sim\gamma^{5/2}$
will hold universally for these instabilities (including beam-plasma and
two-stream configurations) throughout the dynamical evolution and in the
time-asymptotic state. In exceptional cases, such as infinitely massive ions,
the coefficients are less singular and the more familiar trapping scaling
$|E_k|\sim\gamma^2$ is recovered.

analyzed using a very simple model based on thermodynamic considerations. It
was concluded that ion solvation by water molecules may occur in some
particular cases in the organic phase, delivering an important contribution to
the Gibbs free energy of ion transfer between the aqueous and the organic
phase. In general terms, this particular type of transfer should be favored in
the case of highly charged small ions at interfaces with a relatively low
surface tension and a large difference between the reciprocal of the
corresponding dielectric constants.

algebras. In other words we define algebras which we hope have the same
relation to higher dimensional quantum field theories that vertex algebras have
to one dimensional quantum field theories (or to ``chiral halves'' of two
dimensional quantum field theories). The main idea is to define ""vertex
groups"". Then classical vertex algebras turn out to be the same as ""associative
commutative algebras"" over the simplest nontrivial example of a vertex group.
We investigate commutative algebras over higher dimensional vertex groups, some
of which seem to be closely related to (free) quantum field theories.

attributed to the fact that they appear to be the basic algebraic structures
underlying an amazingly diverse set of physical situations. To date many
interesting features of these algebras have been found and they are now known
to belong to a class of algebras called Hopf algebras [1]. The remarkable
aspect of these structures is that they can be regarded as deformations of the
usual Lie algebras. Of late, there has been a considerable interest in the
deformation of the Virasoro algebra and the underlying Heisenberg algebra
[2-11]. In this letter we focus our attention on deforming generalizations of
these algebras, namely the Krichever-Novikov (KN) algebra and its associated
Heisenberg algebra.
