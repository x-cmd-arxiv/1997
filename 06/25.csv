as saying that a large class of solvable groups will not occur as fundamental

luminosity of a tidal disruption is ~L_Edd(5 x 10^7 M_\odot), substantially
below the Eddington luminosities of the most massive disrupting black holes (~2

are found to be large (~7.5 mag). Nevertheless, the brightest flares are likely
to have absolute magnitudes in excess of -19 in V and -21 in U (in the absence
of reddening). Because the spectra are so blue, K-corrections may actually
brighten the flares in optical bands. If such flares are as frequent as
believed, they may soon be detected in low or high redshift supernovae
searches. The He II ionizing radiation produced in the flares may dominate that
which is produced by all other sources in the centers of quiescent galaxies,

discuss limits on the axigluon mass. Specifically,intermediate mass axigluons,
those in the mass range 50 GeV < M_A < 120 GeV which has not already been
excluded, would increase the tree-level qqbar -> ttbar cross-section by a
factor of >= 2, thereby increasing the theoretical predictions for

their collisions with nucleons and produced soft particles, leading to two
distinct absorption mechanisms. The signature of absorption by produced soft
particles, as revealed by psi' production data, consists of a gap and a change
of the slope in going from the pA line to the nucleus-nucleus line when we make
a semi-log plot of the survival probability as a function of the path length.
Using this signature, we find from the J/psi production data in pA, O-Cu, O-U,
and S-U collisions that the degree of J/psi absorption by produced soft
particles is small and cannot account for the J/psi data in Pb-Pb collisions.
The anomalous suppression of J/psi production in Pb-Pb collisions can be
explained as due to the occurrence of a new phase of strong J/psi absorption,
which sets in when the local energy density exceeds about 3.4 GeV/fm^3. To
probe the chemical content of the new phase, we propose to study the abundance
of open-charm mesons and charm hyperons which depends sensitively on the quark
chemical potential.

potential induced by the explicit breakings other than the QCD anomaly of the

on supersymmetry and discrete gauge symmetries that if the compactification
radius is large enough, there can be a U(1)_{PQ}-symmetry whose breaking other
than the QCD anomaly, whatever its microscopic origin is, is suppressed enough
for the axion mechanism to work. Phenomenological viability of such a large
radius crucially depends upon the quantized coefficients in gauge kinetic
functions. We note that the large radius required for the axion mechanism is
viable only in a limited class of models. For instance, for compactifications
on a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold with a vanishing second E_8 field strength, it
is viable only when the quantized flux of the antisymmetric tensor field in
M-theory has a minimal nonzero value. It is also stressed that this large
compactification radius allows the QCD axion in M-theory to be cosmologically
viable in the presence of a late time entropy production.

studies have shown that the main collision effect - coherent pair creation - is
suppressed at photon colliders with the energy (2E < 2 TeV) due to the beam
repulsion, and one can achieve, in principle, the gamma-gamma luminosity
exceeding 10^{35} cm^-2s^-1. The required electron beams with very small

state of each computer in the ensemble is known but not pure. Methods for
obtaining effective pure input states by a series of manipulations have been
described by Gershenfeld and Chuang (logical labeling) and Cory et al. (spatial
averaging) for the case of quantum computation with nuclear magnetic resonance.
We give a different technique called temporal averaging. This method is based
on classical randomization, requires no ancilla qubits and can be implemented
in nuclear magnetic resonance without using gradient fields. We introduce
several temporal averaging algorithms suitable for both high temperature and
low temperature bulk quantum computing and analyze the signal to noise behavior
of each.

  ""Path Integrals and Applications""",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The effective one-loop potential on $R^{m+1}\times S^N$ spaces for massless
tensor fields is evaluated. The Casimir energy is given as a value of $\zeta-$
function by means of which regularization is made. In even- dimensional spaces
the vacuum energy contains divergent terms coming from poles of $\zeta(s,q)$ at
$s=1$, whereas in odd-dimensional spaces it becomes finite.
