frequencies. Different cases with respect to the number of free parameters and
that of the observables to be fitted are investigated. Age is one of the free

hydrogen-helium-diffusion leads to ages deviating by up to 100% from the true,
meteoritic solar age. Our best models including diffusion yield ages by about
10% too high. The implication for general stellar age determination is that a
higher accuracy than that can not be expected, even with the most up-to-date

dominant population. The net result is that a meaningful comparison of the
clustering strength of different morphological types can be performed only in
real space, i.e., after projecting out the redshift distortions on the
two-point correlation function xi(r_p,pi). A power-law fit to the projected
function w_p(r_p) on scales smaller than 10/h Mpc gives r_o =
8.35_{-0.76}^{+0.75} /h Mpc, \gamma = 2.05_{-0.08}^{+0.10} for the early-type

for 25% of the observed intensity in selected regions for a reasonable number
of directly observable \gr pulsars ($\sim$12). While the excess above 1 GeV \gr

clusters of galaxies observed during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). We call
this method the Steepness Ratio Technique (SRT). The SRT uses the convolution
between the real RASS point-spread function and the cluster emission profile
assumed to be a beta-model with the beta parameter fixed to the value of 2/3.
From the convolved source emission profile the SRT extracts total flux and
extension (i.e., core radius) for each cluster. Using the Steepness Ratio (SR)
and a control sample of RASS pointlike sources we are able to assign to each
RASS source a model-independent probability of extension. Potential biases
arising from the hypotheses of a beta-model emission profile and from a fixed
beta value are quantified. Tests with control samples of optically identified
sources extracted from both the ROSAT survey database and from the ROSAT-PSPC
pointed observations archive are performed to check the SRT output. We find
that the source properties derived using the SRT on RASS data are consistent
with those determined from ROSAT-PSPC pointed observations.

show that the initial phase upon hole doping has two components - a conducting
Luttinger liquid in the odd-parity channel, coexisting with an insulating (i.e.
undoped) spin liquid phase in the even-parity channels. This phase has a
partially truncated Fermi surface and violates the Luttinger theorem. This
coexistence of conducting fermionic and insulating paired bosonic degrees of
freedom is similar to the recent proposal of Geshkenbein, Ioffe, and Larkin for
the underdoped spin-gap normal phase of the cuprates. A mean field
approximation is derived which has many similarities to the numerical results.
One difference however is an induced hole pairing in the odd-parity channel at
arbitrary small dopings, similar to that proposed by Geshkenbein, Ioffe, and
Larkin for the two-dimensional case. At higher dopings, we propose that a
quantum phase transition will occur as holes enter the even-parity channels,
resulting in a Luther-Emery liquid with hole pairing with essentially d-wave
character. In the mean field approximation a crossover occurs which we
interpret as a reflection of this quantum phase transition deduced from the

  Phys. A; related articles available on http://daniel.imbm.acad.bg",,"10.1088/0305-4470/30/16/009",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  A modified three-dimensional mean spherical model with a L-layer film
geometry under Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions is considered. Two spherical
fields are present in the model: a surface one fixes the mean square value of
the spins at the boundaries at some $\rho > 0$, and a bulk one imposes the
standard spherical constraint (the mean square value of the spins in the bulk
equals one). The surface susceptibility $\chi_{1,1}$ has been evaluated
exactly. For $\rho =1$ we find that $\chi_{1,1}$ is finite at the bulk critical
temperature $T_c$, in contrast with the recently derived value $\gamma_{1,1}=1$
in the case of just one global spherical constraint. The result
$\gamma_{1,1}=1$ is recovered only if $\rho =\rho_c= 2-(12 K_c)^{-1}$, where
$K_c$ is the dimensionless critical coupling. When $\rho > \rho_c$,
$\chi_{1,1}$ diverges exponentially as $T\to T_c^{+}$. An effective hamiltonian
which leads to an exactly solvable model with $\gamma_{1,1}=2$, the value for
the $n\to \infty $ limit of the corresponding O(n) model, is proposed too.

stars in a close binary, and the stars' orbital motion. Our analysis is based
on the method of matched asymptotic expansions and is valid to all orders in
the strength of internal gravity in each star, but is perturbative in the
``tidal expansion parameter'' (stellar radius)/(orbital separation). At first
order in the tidal expansion parameter, we show that the internal structure of
each star is unaffected by its companion, in agreement with post-1-Newtonian
results of Wiseman (gr-qc/9704018). We also show that relativistic interactions
that scale as higher powers of the tidal expansion parameter produce
qualitatively similar effects to their Newtonian counterparts: there are
corrections to the Newtonian tidal distortion of each star, both of which occur
at third order in the tidal expansion parameter, and there are corrections to
the Newtonian decrease in central density of each star (Newtonian ``tidal
stabilization''), both of which are sixth order in the tidal expansion
parameter. There are additional interactions with no Newtonian analogs, but
these do not change the central density of each star up to sixth order in the
tidal expansion parameter. These results, in combination with previous analyses
of Newtonian tidal interactions, indicate that (i) there are no large
general-relativistic crushing forces that could cause the stars to collapse to
black holes prior to the dynamical orbital instability, and (ii) the
conventional wisdom with respect to coalescing binary neutron stars as sources
of gravitational-wave bursts is correct: namely, the finite-stellar-size
corrections to the gravitational waveform will be unimportant for the purpose
of detecting the coalescences.

the question of what might be its physical consequences. Despite the fact that
accelerating object is known to create gravitational field, there is no known
external dynamic gravitational force from a rotating sphere where the
individual mass components are in constant acceleration. However, Thirring's
`induced centrifugal force' and the component of the force along the
longitudinal axis inside a rotating spherical shell indicate that they are
non-radiative dynamic forces which depend on $\omega^2$. In this report,
Thirring's force is derived by considering the component-wise acceleration of
the rotating hemisphere in the weak field approximation. This new analytic
solution provides the gravitational explanation of the jet phenomena observed
from the fast rotating cosmological bodies, which demands a major revision in
our understanding of the universe since it suggests there exists a strong, long
ranged, non-Newtonian dynamic gravitational force in our universe. This also
raises an interesting question of how the strength of the dipole moment can be
maximized for a given mass by configuring the specific geometrical shape of the
rotating source.

obtained in the participant-spectator model. At low energy the correlations are
equally strong, but more complicated; they are a consequence of the Pauli

mechanical effects, namely generalised Casimir forces, on any scatterer.
  Symmetries of vacuum therefore raise fundamental questions when confronted
with the principle of relativity of motion in vacuum. The specific case of
uniformly accelerated motion is particularly interesting, in connection with
the much debated question of the appearance of vacuum in accelerated frames.
The choice of Rindler representation, commonly used in General Relativity,
transforms vacuum fluctuations into thermal fluctuations, raising difficulties
of interpretation. In contrast, the conformal representation of uniformly
accelerated frames fits the symmetry properties of field propagation and
quantum vacuum and thus leads to extend the principle of relativity of motion
to uniform accelerations.
  Mirrors moving in vacuum with a non uniform acceleration are known to
radiate. The associated radiation reaction force is directly connected to
fluctuating forces felt by motionless mirrors through fluctuation-dissipation
relations. Scatterers in vacuum undergo a quantum Brownian motion which
describes irreducible quantum fluctuations. Vacuum fluctuations impose ultimate
limitations on measurements of position in space-time, and thus challenge the
very concept of space-time localisation within a quantum framework.
  For test masses greater than Planck mass, the ultimate limit in localisation
is determined by gravitational vacuum fluctuations. Not only positions in
space-time, but also geodesic distances, behave as quantum variables,
reflecting the necessary quantum nature of an underlying geometry.

nature of physical observables. It has been known for a long time that
Poincar\'e symmetry of field theory can be extended to the larger conformal
symmetry. We use these symmetries to define quantum observables associated with
positions in space-time, in the spirit of Einstein theory of relativity. This
conception of localisation may be applied to massive as well as massless
fields. Localisation observables are defined as to obey Lorentz covariant
commutations relations and in particular include a time observable conjugated
to energy. Whilst position components do not commute in presence of a
non-vanishing spin, they still satisfy quantum relations which generalise the
differential laws of classical relativity. We also give of these observables a
representation in terms of canonical spatial positions, canonical spin
components and a proper time operator conjugated to mass. These results plead
for a new representation not only of space-time localisation but also of
motion.

exactly-solvable potentials introduced by Natanzon. As well, this class is
shown to contain two new families of exactly solvable potentials.
