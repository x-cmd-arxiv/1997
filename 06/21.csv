  Cracow, 27-30 May 1997",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The overall spectra (SED) of blazars, from radio to gamma-ray energies, seem
to obey well defined trends, with a continuity of properties between blazars of
different classes. To quantify this statement we can either investigate their
observed properties (see Fossati et al., this volume), or try to determine
their intrinsic physical parameters by applying specific models, and trying to
fit their SED. Results of the latter approach are reported here. We applied
simple, one-zone, homogeneous models to all blazars strongly detected in the
gamma-ray band, assuming or not the presence of seed (for the inverse Compton
process) photons produced outside the active region. Our results suggest that
the SEDs of blazars are ruled by the amount of radiative cooling suffered by
the electrons producing most of the emission. In turn, the amount of cooling is
ruled by the amount of the external photon emission, which can be identified
with radiation coming from the broad line clouds. Blazar SEDs are therefore
organized in a sequence: objects with no or very weak emission lines (X-ray
selected BL Lacs, or HBL) are characterized by very high electron energies and
a Compton luminosity of the same order of the synchrotron one. These are TeV
sources. BL Lacertae objects selected in the radio band (or LBL) are
characterized by smaller electron energies, more total power and more line
luminosity, and by a larger ratio of the Compton to synchrotron luminosity.
They are GeV sources. Increasing the total intrinsic power and the line
emission luminosity, we have smaller still electron energies (more cooling) and
greater still Compton to synchrotron power ratio. These are flat spectrum radio
quasars, with a high energy peak located at MeV-GeV energies.

simulations, Hydro-PM (HPM), for the study of the low column density

in addition to the gravitational potential, an effective potential due to the
gas pressure. Such an effective potential can be computed from the density
field because of a tight correlation between density and pressure in the low
density limit, which can be calculated for any photo-reionization history by a
method outlined in Hui & Gnedin (1997). Such a correlation exists, in part,
because of minimal shock-heating in the low density limit. We compare carefully
the density and velocity fields as well as absorption spectra, computed using
HPM versus hydrodynamic simulations, and find good agreement. We show that HPM
is capable of reproducing measurable quantities, such as the column density
distribution, computed from full hydrodynamic simulations, to a precision
comparable to that of observations. We discuss how, by virtue of its speed and
accuracy, HPM can enable us to use the Lyman-alpha forest as a cosmological
probe. We also discuss in detail the smoothing of the gas (or baryon)
fluctuation relative to that of the dark matter on small scales due to finite
gas pressure. It is shown the conventional wisdom that the linear gas
fluctuation is smoothed on the Jeans scale is incorrect for general
reionization (or reheating) history; the correct linear filtering scale is in
general smaller than the Jeans scale after reheating, but larger prior to it.

the detection of 10 new sources, making 16 known altogether. The galaxies
surveyed include a distance-limited sample (covering Seyferts and LINERs with
recession velocities < 7000 km s^{-1}) and a magnitude-limited sample (covering
Seyferts and LINERs with m(B) <= 14.5). In order to determine whether the
H2O-detected galaxies are ""typical"" AGN or have special properties which
facilitate the production of powerful masers, we have accumulated a database of
physical, morphological, and spectroscopic properties of the observed galaxies.
The most significant finding is that H2O megamasers are detected only in
Seyfert 2 and LINER galaxies, not Seyfert 1s. Implications for this finding are
discussed. LINERs are detected at a similar rate to Seyfert 2s, constituting a
strong argument that at least some nuclear LINERs are AGN rather than
starbursts, since starbursts have not been detected as H2O megamasers. We
preferentially detect H2O emission from the nearer galaxies and from those
which are apparently brighter at mid- and far-infrared and centimeter radio
wavelengths. There is also a possible trend for the H2O-detected galaxies to be
more intrinsically luminous in nuclear 6 cm radio emission than the undetected
ones, though these data are incomplete. We find evidence that Seyfert 2s with
very high (N(H) > 10^{24} cm^{-2}) X-ray absorbing columns of gas are more
often detected as H2O maser emitters than Seyfert 2s with lower columns. It may
be that the probability of detecting H2O maser emission in Seyfert galaxies
increases with increasing column of cool gas to the nucleus, from Seyfert 1s
through NLXGs to Seyfert 2s.

evidence of the radial velocity variations characteristic of a double-lined
spectroscopic binary that are required in such a model. After spectroscopic
monitoring of three suitable candidates (Arp 102B, 3C 390.3, and 3C 332)
spanning two decades, we find no such long-term systematic changes in radial
velocity. A trend noticed by Gaskell in one of the Balmer-line peaks of 3C
390.3 before 1988 did not continue after that year, invalidating his inferred
orbital period and mass. Instead, we find lower limits on the plausible orbital
periods that would require the assumed supermassive binaries in all three
objects to have total masses in excess of 10^10 solar masses. In the case of 3C
390.3 the total binary mass must exceed 10^11 solar masses to satisfy
additional observational constraints on the inclination angle. Such large
binary black hole masses are difficult to reconcile with other observations and
with theory. In addition, there are peculiar properties of the line profiles
and flux ratios in these objects that are not explained by ordinary broad-line
region cloud models. We therefore doubt that the double-peaked line profiles of
the three objects arise in a pair of broad-line regions. Rather, they are much
more likely to be intimately associated with a single black hole.

$e^+e^-$ colliders. It is expected to be as a further test to the charmonium
production mechanisms and QED. We find that at the energies of CESR, BEPC, and
TRISTAN (e.g. 4.0 GeV \leq \sqrt s \leq 60 GeV), the contributions of the
concerned electromagnetic processes to the $J/\psi$ inclusive production are
great, even dominant, thus they greatly affect the observation of the
color-octet $J/\psi$ production signature at $e^+e^-$ colliders. The production
of \psi', being similar to that of J/\psi's, is roughly estimated, and its
influence on the observation of the color-octet J/\psi production signature in
e^+e^- collision is also discussed.

Riemann-Hilbert problem formulation permits us to write down completely
integrable equations for the Fredholm determinant and to perform an asymptotic

formulation is similar to N=1 supergravity presented recently using
null-vectors in 12D. In order to see the consistency of this theory, we perform
a simple dimensional reduction to ten-dimensions, reproducing the type IIB
chiral supergravity. We also show that our supergravity can be consistent
background for super (2+2)-brane theory, satisfying fermionic invariance of the
total action. Such supergravity theory without manifest Lorentz invariance had
been predicted by the recent F-theory in twelve-dimensions.
