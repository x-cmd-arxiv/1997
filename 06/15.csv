stars are unstable to transonic, Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities, the role

explosion, the recoil of the protoneutron star, the spatial distribution of
fresh $^{56}$Ni, and the gravitational wave and neutrino signatures of the
event will be affected in interesting ways. I review a subset of the issues
raised by the new paradigm and some of the technical obstacles that remain. I

in enriching the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, in light of the
recent downward shift of the ASCA abundance ratios of alpha-elements to iron
favoured by Ishimaru & Arimoto (1997, PASJ, 49, 1). Because of this shift,
Ishimaru & Arimoto conclude that >50% of the ICM iron must have originated from
within Type Ia SNe progenitors. A point not appreciated in their study, nor in
most previous analyses, is the crucial dependence of such a conclusion upon the
adopted massive star physics. Employing several alternative Type II SN yield
compilations, we demonstrate how uncertainties in the treatment of convection
and mass-loss can radically alter our perception of the relative importance of
Type Ia and II SNe as ICM polluters. If mass-loss of the form favoured by
Maeder (1992, A&A, 264, 105) or convection of the form favoured by Arnett
(1996, Supernovae and Nucleosynthesis) is assumed, the effect upon the oxygen
yields would lead us to conclude that Type Ia SNe play no part in polluting the
ICM, in contradiction with Ishimaru & Arimoto. Apparent dichotomies still exist
(e.g. the mean ICM neon-to-iron ratio implies a 100% Type II Fe origin, while
the mean sulphur ratio indicates a 100% Type Ia origin) that cannot be
reconciled with the currently available yield tables.

areas were surveyed to deeper magnitudes than by TD-1 with various balloon and

  Revised version includes a discussion of the pre-maximum visible intensity.
  Accepted for publicaiton in Ap. J",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The recent discovery of persistent GRB counterparts at lower frequencies
permits several important conclusions to be drawn. The spectrum of GRB970508 is
not consistent with an external shock origin for both the prompt GRB and the
persistent emission, suggesting that at least the prompt radiation is produced
by internal shocks. Comparisons among three GRB with counterparts (or upper
limits on them) establishes that GRB are not all scaled versions of similar
events. The angular size inferred from the apparent observation of
self-absorption in the radio spectrum of GRB970508 a week later implies that
its expansion had slowed to semi-relativistic speeds. This permits a remarkably
low upper bound to be placed on its residual energy, suggesting either that
radiation has been $> 99.7%$ efficient or that the initial outflow was strongly
collimated. Observations of self-absorbed radio emission from future GRB may
permit direct measurement of their expansion and determination of their
parameters and energetics. We estimate initial Lorentz factors for GRB970228
and GRB970508 $\gamma_0 \sim 100$, and present a solution for the evolution of
a blast wave with instantaneous cooling. The visible flux is predicted to rise
initially as a power of $t$ slightly less than unity, in agreement with
observations of GRB970508.

one of the fundamental problems. The dynamical baryogenesis in the process of
the broken symmetry electroweak transition in the expanding Universe is the
widely discussed model where the baryonic asymmetry is induced by the quantum
chiral anomaly. We discuss the modelling of this phenomenon in superfluid 3He
and superconductors where the chiral anomaly is realized in the presence of
quantized vortex, which introduces the nodes in the energy spectrum of the
fermionic quasiparticles. The spectral flow of fermions through the nodes
during the vortex motion leads to creation of the fermionic charge from the
superfluid vacuum and to transfer of the superfluid linear momentum into the
heat bath, thus producing an extra force on the vortex, which in some cases
compensates the Magnus force. This spectral-flow force was calculated 20 years
ago by Kopnin and Kravtsov for s-wave superconductors, but only recently it was
measured in a broad temperature range in Manchester experiments on rotating
superfluid 3He. The ""momentogenesis"" observed in 3He is analogous to the
dynamical production of the baryons by cosmic strings. Some other possible
scenaria of the baryogenesis related to superfluid 3He are discussed.
