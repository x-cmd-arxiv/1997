  Astrophysical Journal Letters",,"10.1086/310852",,"astro-ph",,"  The unidentified X-ray source RX J0720.4-3125 is a candidate isolated neutron
star showing evidence for pulsed emission with an 8.39 s period and a spectrum
consistent with a blackbody at kT=80 eV (Haberl et al. 1996, 1997). We show
that this source is most likely an old isolated neutron star accreting from
surrounding media. We then argue that unless it was born with a long spin
period (P_i >~ 0.5 seconds) and weak field (B_i <~ 10^10 G), the magnetic field
on this star must have decayed. With B_i ~ 10^12 G, we find decay timescales >~
10^7 yrs for power law decay or >~ 10^8 yrs for exponential decay. A measured
period derivative Pdot <~ 10^{-16} s s^{-1} would be consistent with an old
accreting isolated neutron star. Both power law and exponential decay models
can give a Pdot ~ 10^{-16} s s^{-1}, though a Pdot substantially less than this
would be indicative of exponential field decay.

quasars with foreground galaxies as a result of gravitational lensing has been
updated in this paper. Since the galactic matter alone yields an amplitude of
quasar overdensity smaller than that observed, a special attention has been
paid to the examination or re-examination of the uncertainties in the estimate
of the quasar enhancement factor arising from the cosmic evolution of galaxies,
the core radius and velocity bias of galactic matter distributions, the
clusters of galaxies, the obstruction effect by galactic disks, the non-zero
cosmological constant, etc. Unfortunately, none of these factors has been shown
to be able to significantly improve the situation, although a combination of
some effects may provide a result that marginally agrees with observations. It
is concluded that the quasar-galaxy association still remains to be an unsolved
puzzle in today's astronomy, if the reported quasar-galaxy associations are not
due to the statistical variations and/or the observed quasar number counts as a
whole have not been seriously contaminated by gravitational lensing.

homogeneous superconductor in a high magnetic field. We assume a dilute
concentration of scalar impurities and find how $N(\omega)$ behaves as one
crosses from the weak scattering to the strong scattering limit. At low
energies, $N(\omega)\sim \omega ^2$ for small values of the impurity
concentration and scattering strength. When the disorder becomes stronger than
some critical value, a finite density of states is created at the Fermi
surface. These results are a consequence of the gapless nature of the
quasiparticle excitation spectrum in a high magnetic field.

consequences of the lepton mass matrix ansatze are consistent with the current

measurement. %and that three neutrinos are almost degenerate in mass. Three
neutrinos, being almost degenerate with $\sum | m_{\nu_i} | \lesssim 1 $ eV,
can be a part of hot dark matter without any conflict with the constraint from
neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. The $\nu_{\mu} \leftrightarrow
\nu_{\tau}$ oscillation, $\sin^2{2\theta_{\mu \tau}}$, is predicted to be
0.86-0.97 with $\Delta m^2_{\mu \tau}\simeq 2 \times 10^{-3} {eV}^2$, which is
consistent with the atmospheric neutrino data and can be tested further at the
planned MINOS and K2K experiments searching for $\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\tau}$
oscillation.

the Standard Model (SM) prediction, as the effect of interactions mediated by a
colour-octet analogue of the W-boson, the W_8. The presence of a W_8 with mass
O(300) GeV, and with couplings to quarks and gluons of the order of electroweak
strength, allows the observations of the D0 collaboration to be reproduced
quite accurately. Such an interaction is not in contradiction with the present
CDF data on W+ W- or dijet production, though higher luminosities may reveal
measurable effects.

from string theory and quantum gravity. It implies the existence of families of
self-adjoint extensions of the position operators with lattices of eigenvalues.
These lattices, which form representations of certain unitary groups cannot be
resolved on the given geometry. This leads us to conjecture that, within this
framework, degrees of freedom that correspond to structure smaller than the
resolvable (Planck) scale turn into internal degrees of freedom with these
unitary groups as symmetries. The second type of correction terms is related to
the previous essentially by ""Wick rotation"", and its basics are here considered
for the first time. In particular, we investigate unitarily inequivalent
