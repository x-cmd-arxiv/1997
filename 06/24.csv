leads to description of solutions by a linear procedure. This scheme can be
generalized to $G$ bundles over Riemann curves with marked points, where $G$ is
a simple complex Lie group. In some special limit such hamiltonian systems
convert into the Hitchin systems. In particular, for $\SL$ bundles over

  Letters",,"10.1063/1.55404",,"astro-ph",,"  The energetics of optical and radio afterglows following BeppoSAX and BATSE
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggests that gamma-ray emission is not narrowly
collimated, but a moderate beaming is possible, so the total energy of a GRB
may be in the range 10^{50} - 10^{51} erg. All attempts to generate a fireball
powered by neutrino-antineutrino annihilation have failed so far, and a rapid
rotation combined with a magnetic field of $ \sim 10^{15} $ gauss gains
popularity.
  In this paper a hypernova scenario is described: a collapse of a massive
member in a close binary system, similar to the `failed' Type Ib supernova
model proposed by Woosley (1993). The collapse may lead to explosion, with
energy transmitted from the rapidly spinning hot neutron core or black hole to
the envelope by a strong magnetic field, as in a supernova model proposed by
Ostriker and Gunn (1971). However, because of a large mass and rapid rotation
of the core the explosion of a hypernova may release up to 10^{54} erg of
kinetic energy, creating a `dirty' fireball.
  In this scenario a moderately non-spherical explosion may accelerate a very
small fraction of matter to a very large Lorentz factor, and this may give rise
to a gamma-ray burst and its afterglow, just like in a conventional fireball
model. However, the highest velocity ejecta from a hypernova are followed with
matter which expands less rapidly but carries the bulk of kinetic energy,
providing a long term power source for the afterglow. If the afterglows remain
luminous for a very long time then the proposed hypernova scenario may provide
an explanation. Pre-hypernovae, being massive stars, are likely to be located
in the young, star forming regions.

comoving scales from 1 to 16 \hMpc, using an extensive catalog of heavy-element
QSO absorbers with mean redshift 2.2 (C IV) and 0.9 (Mg II). We find that, for
the C IV sample as a whole, the absorber line-of-sight correlation function is
well-fit by a power law with index $\gamma = 1.75 ^{+0.50}_{-0.70}$ and
comoving correlation length $r_0 = 3.4 ^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ \hMpc ($q_0=0.5$). The
clustering of absorbers at high redshift is thus of a form like that of
galaxies and clusters at low redshift, and of amplitude such that absorbers are
correlated on scales of galaxy clusters. We also trace the evolution of the
mean amplitude $\xi_0(z)$ of the correlation function from $z=3$ to $z=0.9$. We
find that, when parametrized as $\xi_0(z)\propto (1+z)^{-(3+\epsilon)+\gamma}$,
the amplitude grows rapidly with decreasing redshift, with maximum-likelihood
value for the evolutionary parameter of $\epsilon = 2.05 \pm 1.0$ ($q_0=0.5$).
When extrapolated to zero redshift, the correlation length is $r_0 = 30
^{+22}_{-13}$ \hMpc . This suggests that the strong C IV and Mg II absorbers,
on megaparsec scales, are biased tracers of the higher-density regions of
space, and that agglomerations of strong absorbers along a line of sight are
indicators of clusters and superclusters. This is supported by recent
observations of ``Lyman break'' galaxies. The rapid growth seen in the
clustering of absorbers mimics that expected in a a critical universe from
linear theory of gravitational instability, and is consistent with
gravitationally induced growth of perturbations.

observed radial velocity dispersion of M giants in Baade's Window, several

Solar neighbourhood, as well as the disc local surface density and scale
parameters. These models have a face-on bar axis ratio b/a=0.5+-0.1 and a bar

mass fraction near the centre. The large microlensing optical depths observed

around R=4 kpc, arguing for a constant thickness Galactic disc. The models also
indicate that a spiral arm starting at the near end of the bar can contribute

especially such having very large Lyapunov coefficients on the chaotic
(indecomposable, topologically transitive) component. We do this by
discretizing the chaotic component on the Surface-of-Section in a (large)
number $N$ of simplectically equally big cells (in the sense of equal relative
invariant ergodic measure, normalized so that the total measure of the chaotic
component is unity). By iterating the transition of the chaotic orbit through
SOS, where $j$ counts the number of iteration (discrete time), and assuming
complete lack of correlations even between consecutive crossings (which can be
justified due to the very large Lyapunov exponents), we show the universal
approach of the relative measure of the occupied cells, denoted by $\rho(j)$,
to the asymptotic value of unity, in the following way: $\rho(j) = 1 -
(1-\frac{1}{N})^j$, so that in the limit of big $N$, $N\to \infty$, we have,
for $j/N$ fixed, the exponential law $\rho(j) \approx 1 - \exp (-j/N)$. This
analytic result is verified numerically in a variety of specific systems: For a
plane billiard (Robnik 1983, $\lambda=0.375$), for a 3-D billiard (Prosen 1997,
$a=-1/5, b=-12/5$), for ergodic logistic map (tent map), for standard map
($k=400$) and for hydrogen atom in strong magnetic field ($\epsilon=-0.05$) the
agreement is almost perfect (except, in the latter two systems, for some
long-time deviations on very small scale), but for H\'enon-Heiles system
($E=1/6$) and for the standard map ($k=3$) the deviations are noticed although
they are not very big (only about 1%). We have tested the random number

gravitation is made for the case of a scalar field. In contrast to the current
belief that only spin matter could detect the teleparallel geometry, scalar
matter being able to feel the metric geometry only, we show that a scalar field
is able not only to feel anyone of these geometries, but also to produce
torsion. Furthermore, both descriptions are found to be completely equivalent,
which means that in fact, besides coupling to curvature, a scalar field couples
also to torsion.

(or marginal stability) of such perturbations for rotating perfect fluids. This
low $m$-instability is strikingly different from the instability to polar
perturbations, which sets in first for large values of $m$. The timescale for
the axial instability appears, for small angular velocity $\Omega$, to be

rotating relativistic star is presented. The calculation includes terms of
first order in $\epsilon \equiv \Omega \sqrt{R^3/M}<<1$ ($R$ is the radius, $M$
is the mass and $\Omega$ is the rotation frequency of the star), and accounts
for effects due to the coriolis force. Effects due to the centrifugal
flattening of the star enter at order $\epsilon^2$ and are not included in the
analysis. It is shown that increased rotation tends to decrease the damping
times for prograde modes, while retrograde become longer lived. Specifically,
we show that rotation affects the axial gravitational-wave $w$-modes in this
way. We also present the first relativistic calculation of the so-called
$r$-modes (analogous to Rossby waves in the Earth's oceans). These have
frequencies of the same order of magnitude as the rotation frequency of the
star. The presented results indicate that the $r$-modes are unstable due to the
emission of gravitational radiation for \underline{all} rotating perfect fluid
stars. This is interesting since the previously considered gravitational-wave
instability associated with (for example) the $f$-mode of the star sets in at a
critical rotation rate. Because they are unstable also for the slowest rotating
stars the $r$-modes may well be of considerable astrophysical importance.

PA's have only real roots, and approximate the distribution function by a sum
of delta-functions, whose locations and weights are identical to the optimal
choice provided by the Gaussian quadrature method for numerical integration. We
show how the first few coefficients in a perturbative series can set rigorous

illustrate the method with the vacuum polarization function and the Bjorken sum

One possible mechanism for this is related to, but not identical with the quark

which adds to the Higgs type mass. Unfortunately, the numerical value of the
generated mass falls short of the desired value (some 5 MeV) by orders of
magnitude. An alternate mechanism, through Higgs-induced left-right couplings
in the squark sector may produce masses of the correct order of magnitude if
the mixing angles are diferent in the squark and quark sectors. To get the
desired result for the $u$ quark mass, we need a stop component mixing of 1/20
for the $LR$ $\tilde{u}$ squark coupling, so the strong CP problem may still be
solved. For the $d$ mass, this mechanism is not really sufficient to solve the

various theoretical investigations of kaon properties in nuclear medium,
focusing on possible uncertainties in each model. We then present a detailed
transport model study of kaon production in heavy-ion collisions at SIS
energies. We shall discuss especially the elementary kaon and antikaon
production cross sections in hadron-hadron interactions, that represent one of
the most serious uncertainties in the transport model study of particle
production in heavy-ion collisions. The main purpose of such a study is to
constrain kaon in-medium properties from the heavy-ion data. This can provide
useful guidances for the development of theoretical models of the kaon in
medium. In the last part of the paper, we apply the kaon in-medium properties
extracted from heavy-ion data to the study of neutron star properties. Based on
a conventional equation of state of nuclear matter that can be considered as
one of the best constrained by available experimental data on finite nuclei, we
find that the maximum mass of neutron stars is about 2$M_\odot$, which is
reduced to about 1.5$M_\odot$ once kaon condensation as constrained by
heavy-ion data is introduced.

  figure",,,,"nucl-th",,"  We show how to attach an external photon to a system of three strongly
interacting nucleons described by three-body scattering equations. Our method
involves the idea of gauging the scattering equations themselves, and results
in electromagnetic amplitudes where the external photon is effectively coupled
to every part of every strong interaction diagram in the model. Current
conservation is therefore implemented in the theoretically correct fashion. In
this way we obtain the expressions needed to calculate all possible
electromagnetic processes of the three-nucleon system including the
electromagnetic form factors of the three-body bound state, pd -> pd gamma,
gamma He3 -> pd, gamma He3 -> ppn, etc. As the photon is coupled everywhere in
the strong interaction model, a unified description of the NNN-gamma NNN system
is obtained. An interesting aspect of our results is the natural appearance of
subtraction terms needed to avoid the overcounting of diagrams. We have also
applied the gauging of equations method to the four-dimensional description of
the piNN system which, because of the possibility of pion absorption, has
overcounting problems all of its own, and is therefore much more complicated
than the NNN case discussed here. Despite these complications, the gauging
procedure itself is very simple and leads easily to a unified description of
the piNN-gamma piNN system.

to determine the $S$--matrix. Special attention is given to the convergence
pattern of the phase-shift and mixing parameters. The calculations have been
performed using realistic local NN potentials and three-nucleon forces.
Important features of the method are anomaly-free solutions and the low
dimensionality of the matrices involved allowing for the inclusion of a large

these results cannot be extrapolated to the very high-energy region.
Introducing a critical distance scale, $a$ , below 10E-25 cm (the wavelength
scale of the highest-energy observed cosmic rays) allows to consider models,
compatible with standard tests of special relativity, where a small violation
of Lorentz symmetry ($a$ can, for instance, be the Planck length, around 10E-33
cm) produces dramatic effects on the interaction properties of very high-energy
particles. Lorentz symmetry violation may potentially solve all the basic
problems raised by the highest-energy cosmic rays (origin and energy,
propagation...). Furthermore, superluminal sectors of matter may exist and
release very high-energy ordinary particles or directly produce very
high-energy cosmic-ray events with unambiguous signatures in very large
detectors. We discuss these phenomena, as well as the cosmic-ray energy range
(well below the energy scale associated to the fundamental length) and
experiments where they could be detected and studied.
