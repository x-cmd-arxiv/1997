galaxy peculiar velocities. We explore the properties of surveys that cover
only two small fields in opposing directions on the sky. Surveys of this type
have several advantages over those that attempt to cover the entire sky; in
particular, by concentrating galaxies in narrow cones these surveys are able to
achieve the density needed to measure several moments of the velocity field
with only a modest number of objects, even for surveys designed to probe scales
$\gtwid 100$\hmpc. We construct mock surveys with this geometry and analyze
them in terms of the three moments to which they are most sensitive. We
calculate window functions for these moments and construct a $\chi^2$ statistic
which can be used to put constraints on the power spectrum. In order to explore
the sensitivity of these surveys, we calculate the expectation values of the
moments and their associated measurement noise as a function of the survey
parameters such as density and depth and for several popular models of
structure formation. In addition, we have studied how well these kind of
surveys can distinguish between different power spectra and found that, for the
same number of objects, cone surveys are as good or better than full-sky
surveys in distinguishing between popular cosmological models. We find that a
survey with $200-300$ galaxy peculiar velocities with distance errors of 15% in
two cones with opening angle of $\sim 10^\circ$ could put significant
constraints on the power spectrum on scales of $100-300$\hmpc, where few other

synchronized, patterns of star formation without any explicit propagation or
any separate organizing agent. At a given location, star formation is assumed
to occur when the gas velocity dispersion falls below a critical value
dependent on the density. Young stars inject energy into the gas in their
neighborhood, increasing the velocity dispersion and inhibiting the
instability. A dissipation function continually ""cools"" the gas. The stability
of this local inhibitory feedback model is examined both analytically and
numerically. A large number of two-dimensional simulations are used to examine
the effect of spatial couplings due to energy injection into neighboring

alignment.We make quantitative estimates of grain alignment efficiency for six
mechanisms, involving grains with either thermal or suprathermal rotation,
interacting with either magnetic field or gaseous flow. We also make
semiquantitative estimates of grain alignment by radiative torques.We show that
in conditions typical of dark cloud interiors, all known major mechanisms of
grain alignment fail. All the studied mechanisms predict polarization at least
an order of magnitude below the currently detectable levels of order of 1%. On
the contrary, in the dark cloud environments where A_v<1 the grain alignment
can be much more efficient. There the alignment of suprathermally rotating
grains with superparamagentic inclusions, and possibly also radiative torques
account for observed polarization. These results apply to L1755, which we model
in detail and probably also to B216 and other similar dark clouds. Our study
suggests an explanation for the difference in results obtained through
polarimetry of background starlight and polarized thermal emission from the
dust itself. We conjecture that the emission polarimetry selectively reveals
aligned grains in the environment far from thermodynamic equilibrium as opposed

the Coma cluster can be extended by using highly X-ray luminous clusters of
galaxies. This is likely to be more efficient than with other astrophysical
objects viewable on these scales since (1) X-ray clusters would be at least as
easy to identify if viewed from other angles as any other objects and (2) the
X-ray emitting thermally heated gas is likely to be simpler than for other
objects.
  Possibilities that the highly luminous cluster RXJ~1347.5-1145 ($z=0\.45$)

RXJ~1347.5-1145, the Coma cluster and the cluster CL~09104+4109 form nearly a

By employing this approach and integrating the continuity equation, we are able
to find two integrals of motion when the Poynting-Robertson drag dominates the
dissipative forces in the dust flow. These integrals of motion enable us to
explore basic characteristics of dust flows from any sources in the Solar
system (such as asteroids, comets, Kuiper belt, etc.) or in another planetary
system. In particular, we have reproduced the classical solution $n(r)\propto

X-ray heating of the companion star and the accretion disk yields a mass
accretion rate Mdot=4.0x10^(-8) Msun/yr; the X-ray luminosity implied by this
value is consistent with the X-ray flux measured during simultaneous
observations. The model accurately predicts observed B magnitude and
ultraviolet variations over both orbital and long-term periods. The UV P-Cygni
lines show dramatic changes with orbital phase: strong broad absorption near
X-ray eclipse and narrow absorption when the X-ray source is in the
line-of-sight. We interpret this as a result of X-ray photoionization of the
stellar wind; when the neutron star is in front of the normal star, the wind
absorption disappears and mainly the photospheric absorption lines are visible.
The X-ray pulse period measured during our observations, 13.5090+/-0.0002s, is
consistent with steady spin-down over the past 10 years. No pulsations were
detected in the UV observations with upper limits to the pulsed fraction around
N V and C IV of 1.8% and 2.7% in the continuum and 12.4% and 7% in the
absorption troughs.

conclude that the system of resonances produces no qualitative modifications to

neutralino (or any other longlived particles) at the CERN LHC and at Very Large
Hadron Collider (VLHC). We first point out that such hadron colliders will
become the ``neutralino factory'' producing 10^6--10^9 neutralinos/yr, if
gluinos and/or squarks actually exist below O(1) TeV. The lightest neutralino
(\neu), usually assumed to be stable, will be unstable if lighter
superparticles such as the gravitino (\gra) or axino (\axi) exist, or R-parity
is not conserved. The decay signal would, however, be missed in usual collider
experiments, particularly when the decay mostly occurs outside the detector. In
order to search for such a slow decay of \neu, we propose a dedicated
experiment where the collision products are dumped by a thick shield, which is
followed by a long decay tunnel. The decay product of \neu can be detected by a
detector located at the end of the tunnel. The slow arrival time and the large
off angle (to the direction of the interaction point) of the decay product will
provide a clear signature of slowly decaying \neu's. One can explore the decay
length (c\tau) in a wide range, i.e., 0.2 m to 1x10^5 km for \mneu=25 GeV and 1
m to 2 km for \mneu=200 GeV at the LHC. This corresponds to the range of the
SUSY breaking scale \rtF=2x10^5 to 2x10^7 GeV in case of the \neu\to\gamma\gra
decay predicted in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking models. At VLHC, one can extend
the explorable range of \mneu up to 1000 GeV, and that of \rtF up to 1x10^8
GeV. In case of the \neu\to\gamma\axi decay, the Peccei- Quinn symmetry
breaking scale F_a can be explored up to 5x10^11 GeV. The mass of the decaying
particle can be determined by using the correlation between the energy and the
arrival time of the decay product.

expected to change markedly. In fact, within error limits, there is no evidence
for a process dependence in energetic B-decays. The success of factorization
allows the determination of decay constants from non-leptonic decays. For the

f_{D_s^*}=(271\pm33) MeV. The ratio a_2^{eff}/a_1^{eff} is positive in B-decays

interference in B^- and D^+ decays, respectively. Qualitatively, this can be

these authors succeeded in identifying the central part, the spin-dependent
part and the leading relativistic corrections to the central potential. The
potential offers a good account of the energies and splittings of charmonium
and the upsilon system. Since all of the flavor dependence of the interaction
is presumed to enter through the constituent masses, it is possible to test the
potential in other systems. Logical candidates are the heavy B-flavor charmed
system and the heavy-light systems, which should be more sensitive to the
relativistic corrections. Lattice gauge calculations furnish an additional
point of contact for the components of the BBZ potential. Some preliminary
calculations of the energies of B and D mesons are presented and the challenge

We find that the kinetic equilibrium is achieved before the system reaches the
critical temperature of quark hadron phase transition. We find that chemical
equilibrium is not achieved during this time. We have evaluated the
electromagnetic probes of quark gluon plasma from the non-equilibrated quark
gluon phase and compared them with those in completely equilibrated scenario.
The hard QCD production rates for the electromagnetic ejectiles as well as the
heavy quark production rates are also calculated.

nucleon-nucleon and central nucleus-nucleus collisions is presented. It is
shown that at all collision energies the pion/baryon and strangeness/pion
ratios indicate saturation with the size of the colliding nuclei. The energy
dependence of the saturation level suggests that the transition to the Quark
Gluon Plasma occurs between 15 AGeV/c (BNL AGS) and 160 AGeV/c (CERN SPS)
collision energies. The experimental results interpreted in the framework of a
statistical approach show that the effective number of degrees of freedom
increases in the course of the phase transition and that the plasma created at
CERN SPS energies may have a temperature of about 280 MeV (energy density 10
GeV/fm-3). The presence of the phase transition can lead to the non-monotonic
collision energy dependence of the strangeness/pion ratio. After an initial
increase the ratio should drop to the characteristic value for the QGP. Above
the transition region the ratio is expected to be collision energy independent.
Experimental studies of central Pb+Pb collisions in the energy range 20--160
AGeV/c are urgently needed in order to localize the threshold energy, and study
the properties of the QCD phase transition.

pass a state of thermal equilibrium. These findings question the recent
conjecture that in these collisions a phase transition of first order, similar
to that between water and vapor, can be observed.

  Relativistic Physics and some of its Applications, Athens (Greece) 25-28 June
  1997",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  We discuss the implications of a recently proposed pattern of Lorentz
symmetry violation on very high-energy cross sections. As a consequence of the
breaking of local Lorentz invariance by the introduction of a fundamental
length, $a$ , the kinematics is modified and the properties of final states are
fundamentally different in collider-like (two incoming particles with equal,
opposite momenta with respect to the vacuum rest frame) and fixed-target (one
of the incoming particles at rest with respect to the vacuum rest frame)
situations. In the first case, the properties of the allowed final states are
similar to relativistic kinematics, as long as the relevant wave vectors are
much smaller than the critical wave vector scale $a^{-1}$ . But, if one of the
incoming particles is close to rest in the vacuum rest frame, energy
conservation reduces the final-state phase space at very high energy and can
lead to a sharp fall of cross sections starting at incoming-particle wave
vectors well below the inverse of the fundamental length. Then, the Froissart
bound may cease to be relevant, as total cross sections seem to become much
smaller than it would be allowed by local, Lorentz-invariant, field theory.
Important experimental implications of the new scenario are found for
cosmic-ray astrophysics and for very high-energy cosmic rays reaching the
earth.

Using this, we then classify all non skew-symmetric dynamical r-matrices when g
is a simple Lie algebra and l a commutative subalgebra containing a regular
semisimple element. This partially answers a question in [EV] q-alg/9703040 and
generalizes the Belavin-Drinfeld classification of constant r-matrices. This
