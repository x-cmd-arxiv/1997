are reviewed. The geometrical distribution of the dust inside the galaxy plays
a fundamental role in determining the wavelength dependence of the obscuration
and the opacity of the galaxy. In the local Universe, late Hubble type galaxies
appear to contain enough dust that corrections for the effect of obscuration
become important. This is true expecially at blue and UV wavelengths, i.e. in
the wavelength range of interest for studies of massive stars and star
formation processes. Multiwavelength observations provide a powerful tool for
characterizing the reddening caused by dust. A `recipe' is given for removing
the dust reddening and recovering the UV and optical light in star-forming
galaxies.

detailed numerical Monte Carlo study designed to assess the uncertainty
associated with the theoretical age-turnoff luminosity relationship in order to
estimate both the absolute age and uncertainty in age of the oldest globular
clusters. Our best estimate for the mean age of the oldest globular clusters is
now $11.5\pm 1.3 $Gyr, with a one-sided, 95% confidence level lower limit of
9.5 Gyr. This represents a systematic shift of over 2 $\sigma$ compared to our

is not just due to the Hipparcos data. This now provides a lower limit on the

interpret local perturbations to the cluster shear field on small scales

lensing signal to place new constraints on the average mass-to-light ratio and
spatial extents of the dark matter halos associated with
morphologically-classified early-type cluster members. We find that the total

and the dissipation field are analytically determined, exploiting the dynamical
formulation of the model. The Gaussianity known to be present at small scales
for incompressible velocity fields emerges here at large scales ($x\gg L$).
These scales are shown to be excited by an inverse cascade of $\theta ^{2}$ and
the probability distribution function (PDF) of the corresponding scalar
differences to approach the Gaussian form, as larger and larger scales are
considered. Small scales ($x\ll L$) statistics is shown to be strongly
non-Gaussian. Collapse of scaling exponents for scalar structure
functions\thinspace takes place: moments of order $p\ge 1$ scale all linearly,
independently of the order $p$. Smooth scaling $x^{p}$ is found for $-1<p<1$.
Tails of scalar differences PDF are exponential while, at the center, a cusped
shape tends to develop when smaller and smaller ratios $x/L$ are considered.
The same tendency is present for scalar gradients PDF with respect to the
inverse of the P\'{e}clet number (the pumping-to-diffusion scale ratio). The
tails of the latter PDF are however much more extended, decaying as a stretched
exponential of exponent 2/3, smaller than unity. This slower decay is
physically associated with the strong fluctuations of the dynamical dissipative

with the semi-empirical many-body Sutton-Chen potential, corrected for the
charge transfer between the metallic overlayer and the substrate. The
interactions between the Al adatoms and sapphire substrate are described with a
simple three-dimensional potential field which has the hexagonal periodicity of
sapphire surface. Our energy analysis gave evidence that the structure which is
observed at room temperature is in fact a frozen high-temperature structure. In
accordance with the X-ray scattering, a hexagonal domain pattern separated by
domain walls has been found. The Al adatoms, distributed in two monolayers, are
ordered and isomorphic to metallic Al(111) in the domains and disordered in the
domain walls. The main reason for the rotational reconstruction is the lattice
misfit between the metallic Al and sapphire.

the SC in $xG(x,Q^2)$ is so large that the BFKL Pomeron is hidden under the SC
and cannot be seen even in such ""hard"" processes that have been proposed to
test it. We found that the gluon density is proportional to $\ln(1/x)$ in the
region of very small $x$. This result means that the gluon density does not
reach saturation in the region of applicability of the new evolution equation.
It should be confronted with the solution of the GLR equation which leads to
saturation.

obtained as ground structures in clusters with n=3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15,
indicating that convergence to bulk structure is not achieved yet at this size

thermodynamic states, or equivalently, statistical mechanical states, can be
characterised concisely in terms of the geometry of a submanifold ${\cal M}$ of

of a thermodynamic variable then corresponds to the reduction of a state vector
in ${\cal H}$ to an eigenstate, where the transition probability is the
Boltzmann weight. We derive a set of uncertainty relations for conjugate
thermodynamic variables in the equilibrium thermodynamic states. These follow
as a consequence of a striking thermodynamic analogue of the Anandan-Aharonov
relations in quantum mechanics. As a result we are able to provide a resolution
to the controversy surrounding the status of `temperature fluctuations' in the
canonical ensemble. By consideration of the curvature of the thermodynamic
trajectory in its state space we are then able to derive a series of higher
order variance bounds, which we calculate explicitly to second order.

interesting novel effects in atomic dynamics, including line narrowing in
resonance fluorescence and absorption spectra, and a suppressed (enhanced)
decay of the in-phase and out-of phase component of the atomic polarization. On
the experimental side these predictions have so far eluded observation,
essentially due to the difficulty of embedding atoms in a 4 pi squeezed vacuum.
In this paper we show how to ``engineer'' a squeezed-bath-type interaction for
an effective two-level system. In the simplest example, our two-level atom is
represented by the two ground levels of an atom with angular momentum J=1/2 ->
J=1/2 transition (a four level system) which is driven by (weak) laser fields
and coupled to the vacuum reservoir of radiation modes. Interference between
the spontaneous emission channels in optical pumping leads to a squeezed bath
type coupling, and thus to symmetry breaking of decay on the Bloch sphere. With
this system it should be possible to observe the effects predicted in the
context of squeezed bath - atom interactions. The laser parameters allow one to
choose properties of the squeezed bath interaction, such as the (effective)
photon number expectation number N and the squeezing phase phi. We present
results of a detailed analytical and numerical study.
