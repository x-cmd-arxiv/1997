these main features, and thus masquerade as planetary events. These events
require a binary source with a small flux ratio, $\epsil \sim 10^{-2}-10^{-4}$,

Balmer series of hydrogen is also present in emission with a strong decrement,
and Balmer lines are seen as broad absorptions. Several high ionization
emission features are also present including O VI (3811, 3834, and 5290A).
Radial velocities and photometry confirm that the binary period is ~0.1719d,
and an improved value of the period is derived from four years of photometry
and analysis of ROSAT-HRI X-ray data. The orbital light variation is primarily
due to an eclipse of the extensive accretion disk. X-ray and optical minima
occur together. The UBV light curves are similar to each other, and no clear
phase-related color variations are found. He II emission-line velocities show a
semi-amplitude of K ~100 km/s, and maximum velocity occurs when the light curve
indicates the compact star would be moving away from the observer, suggesting
this emitting region may trace the orbital motion of the compact star. The
range of possible masses implied for the X-ray source lies between 0.5 and 1.5
solar masses if the mass donor is a main sequence star filling its Roche lobe.
The light curve suggests values at the high end of this range. The broad H
absorption lines appear to have a much larger velocity amplitude and lower
systemic velocity, making it difficult to understand their origin. We discuss
possible models for the system.

The line is highly optically thick and relatively wide (15 km/s FWHM), with a
profile that is similar to that of the previously detected CO(2--1) and
HCO^+(2--1) optically thick absorption lines toward this quasar. From the
measured level of the continuum at 330.59 GHz, which corresponds to the level
expected from the power-law spectrum $S(\nu) \propto \nu^{-0.25}$ already

The hot gas cools onto a large disk having a size that depends inversely on the

be difficult to observe, the photoionized part of the cooled gaseous disk gas
can be observed in optical line emission. The mass of HII gas ($\sim 10^8$

the stellar disks that are common in low luminosity ellipticals as stars that
have formed in the non-ionized part of the cold disk gas. The total mass and
distribution of cold disk gas available for star formation are similar to those
of stellar disks observed. The high stellar H$\beta$ photometric index observed

assumed. Two source terms operate: mass loss from evolving stars, and a
secularly declining heating by SNIa. Relevant atomic physical processes are
modeled in detail. Like the previous models investigated by Ciotti et al.
(1991), these new models first evolve through three consecutive evolutionary
stages: wind, outflow, and inflow. At this point the presence of the BH alters
dramatically the subsequent evolution, because the energy emitted by the BH can
heat the surrounding gas to above virial temperatures, causing the formation of
a hot expanding central bubble. Short and strong nuclear bursts of radiation
are followed by longer periods during which the X-ray galaxy emission comes
from the coronal gas (Lx). The range and approximate distribution spanned by Lx
are found to be in accordance with observations of X-ray early type galaxies.
Moreover, although high accretion rates occur during bursting phases when the
central BH has a luminosity characteristic of QSOs, the total mass accreted is
very small when compared to that predicted by stationary cooling-flow solutions
and computed masses are in accord with putative BH nuclear masses. In the
bursting phases Lx is low and the surface brightness profile is very low
compared to pre-burst or to cooling flow models. We propose that these new
models, while solving some long-standing problems of the cooling flow scenario,
can provide a unified description of QSO-like objects and X-ray emitting
elliptical galaxies, these being the same objects observed at two different
evolutionary phases.

with Comptonization by a thermal plasma kT<100 keV in its hard X-ray part,

  Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.57.1519",,"chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  We investigate chaotic scattering on an attractive step potential with a
quadrupolar deformation. The phase space features of the bound billiard are
studied by using the notion of symmetry lines to find periodic orbits. We show
that the scattering dynamics is intimately linked to structures in the bound
billiard (infinite potential wall) phase space. The existence of preferred
scattering directions is shown to be a consequence of large scale features of
the phase space such as the period-two orbits. Self-similarity in the
scattering functions is directly linked to unstable periodic orbits of the
bound phase space. The main observations and methodology are applicable to
concave billiards in general.

time series. These features provide a theoretical basis for selecting the
optimal size for the number of neurons in the input layer. The main outcome for
the number of neurons in the input layer. The main outcome of the new approach
for such problems is that to a large extent it defines the ANN architecture and
leads to better predictions. We illustrate our method by considering computer
generated periodic and chaotic time series. The ANN model developed gave
excellent quality of fit for the training and test sets as well as for
iterative dynamic predictions for future values of the two time series.
Further, computer experiments were conducted by introducing Gaussian noise of
various degrees in the two time series, to simulate real world effects. We find
rather surprising results that upto a limit introduction of noise leads to a
smaller network with good generalizing capability.

The results indicate that the phase speed of a longitudinally oscillating

similar analysis is presented for a longitudinally oscillating gravitational
field produced by a vibrating mass. The result also indicates that the phase
speed of a longitudinally oscillating gravitational field is also much faster
than the speed of light in the near-field. The possibility of measuring the
group speed of a longitudinally oscillating electrical field and a
longitudinally oscillating gravitational field, which is commonly thought to be
equal to the speed of light, is now being considered. The basic idea is to
amplitude-modulate the longitudinal vibration of a charge or a mass and to
measure the resultant longitudinal vibration of a nearby charge or a mass due
to electrical or gravitational interaction. The modulation signal can then be
extracted using a diode detector and the group speed can then be determined
from the oscillation frequency, the separation distance between the masses, and
the measurement of the phase shift of the modulation signal. If the group speed
is equal to the speed of light, then phase shifts on the order of 1 microdegree
could be generated with a typical experimental set-up. An analysis using the
classical definition of group velocity for a longitudinally oscillating

consistent branching ratios, with and without the unification condition for

generalized Lagrange and Finsler geometry and leads to modelling of physical
processes on higher order fiber bundles provided with nonlinear and
distingushed connections and metric structures. The view adopted in the
monograph is that a general field theory should incorporate all possible
anisotropic and stochastic manifestations of classical and quantum interactions
and, in consequence, a corresponding modification of basic principles and
mathematical methods in formulation of physical theories. This book can be also
considered as a pedagogical survey on the mentioned subjects.

for the $(h,w)$-deformed Heisenberg algebra ${\cal U}_{h,w}(h(4))$. A
representation of the reflection matrix $K$ is constructed using the matrix
generators $L^{(\pm)}$ of the ${\cal U}_{h,w}(h(4))$ algebra. A series of
representations of the K-matrix then may be generated by using the coproduct
rules of the ${\cal U}_{h,w}(h(4))$ algebra. The complementary condition
necessary for combining two distinct solutions of the reflection equation
algebra yields the braiding relations between these two sets of generators.
This may be thought as a generalization of Bose-Fermi statistics to braiding
statistics, which them may be used to provide a new braided colagebraic
structure to a Hopf algebra generated by the elements of the matrix $K$. The
reflection equation algebra and the braided exchange properties are found to
depend on both deformation parameters $h$ and $w$.

impurity resonance atoms is studied using the Bethe ansatz technique. The
spectrum is shown to contain pairs of quantum correlated ``gap excitations''
and their heavy bound complexes (``gap solitons''), enabling the propagation of
quantum information within the classically forbidden gap. In addition,
multiparticle localization of the radiation and the medium polarization occurs
when such a gap soliton is pinned to the impurity atom.

  Quantum Mechanics","standard LaTeX file, with 11 figures (in postscript) attached",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this review-article, we discuss the consequences of the introduction of a
quantum of time tau_0 in the formalism of non-relativistic quantum mechanics
(QM) by referring ourselves in particular to the theory of the ""chronon"" as
proposed by P.Caldirola. Such an interesting ""finite difference"" theory,
forwards --at the classical level-- a solution for the motion of a particle
endowed with a non-negligible charge in an external electromagnetic field,
overcoming all the known difficulties met by Abraham-Lorentz's and Dirac's
approaches (and even allowing a clear answer to the question whether a free
falling charged particle does or does not emit radiation), and --at the quantum
level-- yields a remarkable mass spectrum for leptons. After having briefly
reviewed Caldirola's approach, we compare one another the new Schroedinger,
Heisenberg and density-operator (Liouville-von Neumann) pictures resulting from
it. Moreover, for each representation, three (retarded, symmetric and advanced)
formulations are possible, which refer either to times t and t-tau_0, or to
times t-tau_0/2 and t+tau_0/2, or to times t and t+tau_0, respectively. It is
interesting to notice that, e.g., the ""retarded"" QM does naturally appear to
describe QM with friction, i.e., to describe dissipative quantum systems (like
a particle moving in an absorbing medium). In this sense, discretized QM is
much richer than the ordinary one. When the density matrix formalism is applied
to the solution of the measurement problem in QM, very interesting results are
met, so as a natural explication of ""decoherence"".
