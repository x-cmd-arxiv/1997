bursts from other sources, a secondary (and a tertiary) weaker burst
immediately following the primary burst are observed. Detailed energy spectra
indicate that the source softens during the main outburst and successively
hardens during the secondary and tertiary bursts. This may imply that the
accretion flow has a corona-disk configuration and that the relative
contribution of the hot corona decreases during the primary bursts and
increases during the secondary and tertiary bursts. The primary burst profile
resembles the bursts produced in the time dependent evolutions of accretion
disks which are thermally and viscously unstable. The secondary burst may
reflect an inward shift of the inner edge of the disk which results in a
greater release of gravitational binding energy.

black-hole candidate 4U1630-47. For the first time we present almost complete
coverage of the outbursts which started in 1987, 1988 and 1996. We find that
the outburst behaviour of 4U1630-47 is more complex than previously realized.
The source shows outbursts with durations on the order of ~100-200 days and
sometimes intervals of long-term X-ray activity.
  The relatively short outbursts which occurred in 1987 and 1996 exhibited
different colour behaviour: the outburst in 1987 showed softening of the X-ray
spectrum, whereas the outburst in 1996 showed hardening of the X-ray spectrum,
as the outbursts proceeded.
  The outburst which started in 1977 may have lasted for up to ~10 months,
whereas the outburst which started in 1988 showed activity for up to ~2.4
years. Such long-term activity is reminiscent of that seen in GRS1716-249 and
in the galactic superluminal sources GRS1915+105 and GROJ1655-40.
  We refine the outburst ephemeris of 4U\1630-47 and find that the outburst
recurrence time scale may have changed from ~600 days to ~690 days between the
1984 and 1987 outbursts. If the recurrence interval of ~690 days continues, the
next outburst of 4U1630-47 is predicted to occur in 1998 January.

  Physical Review B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.56.11951",,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  We present here a calculation of the inertial mass of a moving vortex in
cuprate superconductors. This is a poorly known basic quantity of obvious
interest in vortex dynamics. The motion of a vortex causes a dipolar density
distortion and an associated electric field which is screened. The energy cost
of the density distortion as well as the related screened electric field
contribute to the vortex mass, which is small because of efficient screening.
As a preliminary, we present a discussion and calculation of the vortex mass
using a microscopically derivable phase-only action functional for the far
region which shows that the contribution from the far region is negligible, and
that most of it arises from the (small) core region of the vortex. A
calculation based on a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau functional is performed
in the core region. Unfortunately such a calculation is unreliable, the reasons
for it are discussed. A credible calculation of the vortex mass thus requires a
fully microscopic, non-coarse grained theory. This is developed, and results
are presented for a s-wave BCS like gap, with parameters appropriate to the
cuprates. The mass, about 0.5 $m_e$ per layer, for magnetic field along the $c$
axis, arises from deformation of quasiparticle states bound in the core, and
screening effects mentioned above. We discuss earlier results, possible
extensions to d-wave symmetry, and observability of effects dependent on the
inertial mass.

simulations and analytic arguments. Specifically, we consider a two-dimensional
model with a nonconserved, scalar order parameter (Model A), quenched through
an order-disorder transition into the two-phase regime. For such systems it is
well established that the standard scaling hypothesis applies, consequently the
average scattering intensity at wavevector _k and time t' is proportional to a
scaling function which depends only on a rescaled time, t ~ |_k|^2 t'. We find
that the simulated intensities are exponentially distributed, with the
time-dependent average well approximated using a scaling function due to Ohta,
Jasnow, and Kawasaki. Considering fluctuations around the average behavior, we
find that the covariance of the scattering intensity for a single wavevector at
two different times is proportional to a scaling function with natural
variables mt = |t_1 - t_2| and pt = (t_1 + t_2)/2. In the asymptotic large-pt
limit this scaling function depends only on z = mt / pt^(1/2). For small values
of z, the scaling function is quadratic, corresponding to highly persistent
behavior of the intensity fluctuations. We empirically establish a connection
between the intensity covariance and the two-time, two-point correlation
function of the order parameter. This connection allows sensitive testing,
either experimental or numerical, of existing theories for two-time
correlations in systems undergoing order-disorder phase transitions. Comparison
between theory and our numerical results requires no adjustable parameters.

configurations. We obtained a very small string tension which is inconsistent
with the string tension extracted from Polyakov loop correlators. This shows
that the Polyakov gauge projected abelian configurations do not have a
consistent physical meaning. We also applied the smoothing on SU(2)
configurations to test how sensitive abelian dominance in the maximal abelian
gauge is to the short distance fluctuations. We found that on smoothed SU(2)
configurations the abelian string tension was about 30% smaller than the SU(2)
string tension which was unaffected by smoothing. This suggests that the
approximate abelian dominance found with the Wilson action is probably an
accident and it has no fundamental physical relevance.

strong coupling is studied in Au+Au collisions at LHC and at RHIC energies.
With increasing coupling, the following are found to happen: 1) both thermal
and chemical equilibration speed up, 2) in the final degree of equilibration,
only quarks and antiquarks show obvious improvements but not gluons and 3) the
plasma cools much more rapidly. The deconfinement phase transition will
therefore takes place sooner and it naturally results in the shortening of the
parton phase of the plasma. The exact duration of this phase is however
sensitive to the value of the coupling. A change from $\a_s=0.3$ to $\a_s=0.5$,
for example, reduces the lifetime of the parton phase at LHC by as much as 4.0
fm/c. The total generated entropy is another sensitive quantity to the
coupling. Larger values of $\a_s$ will lead to entropy reduction and therefore
reduction both in the duration of the mixed phase, as well as in the final pion
multiplicity. It is shown that the common choice of $\a_s=0.3$ is not a good
value for the entire duration of the evolution given that the system undergoes
substantial changes from the beginning to the time that the deconfinement phase
transition is about to take place. Instead, by using a more consistent simple
recipe, the system is allowed to decide its own strength of the interactions
which evolves with the system as it should. With this approach, $\a_s$
increases with time and this leads to acceleration in the equilibration even as
equilibrium is near. This is opposite to the behavior of the equilibration of a

  Egmond aan Zee, The Netherlands",,,"LBL-40457","hep-ph",,"  The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) will be the first heavy ion
accelerator energetic enough to produce hadronic final states via coherent
\gamgam, \gampom, and \pompom interactions. Because the photon flux scales as
$Z^2$, up to an energy of about $\gamma\hbar c/R\approx 3$ GeV/c, the \gamgam\
interaction rates are large. RHIC $\gamma P$ interactions test how Pomerons
couple to nuclei and measure how different vector mesons, including the
$J/\psi$, interact with nuclear matter. $PP$ collisions can probe Pomeron
couplings. Because these collisions can involve identical initial states, for
identical final states, the \gamgam, \gampom, and \pompom channels may
interfere, producing new effects. We review the physics of these interactions
and discuss how these signals can be detected experimentally, in the context of
the STAR detector. Signals can be separated from backgrounds by using isolation
cuts (rapidity gaps) and $p_\perp$. We present Monte Carlo studies of different
backgrounds, showing that representative signals can be extracted with good
rates and signal to noise ratios.

point of view of the astrophysical systems and the heavy ion collisions.
Therefore, accurate calculations of the elastic scattering cross-sections of
$qq' \to qq'$ and $ q\qbar' \to q\qbar'$ processes are required. At the
tree-diagram level exchange of massless gluons leads to divergent cross
sections for such processes. An effective way to remove the infrared divergence
is to introduce a Debye mass as an infrared regulator into the gluon propagator
for the thermal gluons. In this work we find that at the two-gluon exchange
level such a technique fails to remove the divergences. In a chiral symmetry
broken phase the mass could be introduced following the standard procedure
which cures the divergence. But in a chirally symmetric phase chiral invariant
mass of the fermions needs to be considered.

low energy and resolution there appear quasiparticles - constituent quarks and
Goldstone bosons. Thus, light and strange baryons should be considered as
systems of three constituent quarks with confining interaction and a chiral
interaction that is mediated by Goldstone bosons between the constituent
quarks. We show how the flavor-spin structure and sign of the short-range part
of the Goldstone boson exchange interaction reduces the $SU(6)_{FS}$ symmetry
down to $SU(3)_F \times SU(2)_S$, induces hyperfine splittings and provides
correct ordering of the lowest states with positive and negative parity. We
present a unified description of light and strange baryon spectra calculated in
a semirelativistic framework. It is demonstrated that the same short-range part
of Goldstone boson exchange also induces strong short-range repulsion in $NN$
system when the latter is treated as $6Q$ system. Thus, all main ingredients of
$NN$ interaction are implied by the chiral constituent quark model since the
long- and intermediate-range attraction appears in the present framework due to
pion and correlated two-pion exchanges between quarks belonging to different
nucleons. We also find a very strong short-range repulsion in $\Lambda\Lambda$
system with $J^P=0^+$. It then suggests that the compact H-particle should not
exist.

in certain cases the solution of the Coulomb branch for N=2 gauge theories is
