source, RX J0049.1-7250, located north-east of the SMC supernova remnant N19
and which may either be an X-ray binary or an AGN turns out to be strongly
absorbed. It may be located behind the SMC. If it is an X-ray binary then it
radiates at the Eddington limit in the X-ray bright state. Another variable and
hard X-ray source RX J0032.9-7348 has been discovered at the south-eastern

this source. We searched for CAL87 like systems in the SMC catalog and found
none. A new candidate supersoft source RX J0103.8-7254 has been detected. We
cannot exclude that it is a foreground object.

minimization to explore the 4-dimensional parameter space having as free
parameters, h, Omega_o, the power spectrum slope n and the power spectrum
normalization at L=10. Conditioning on Omega_o=1 we obtain h=0.33 +/- 0.08.
Allowing Omega_o to be a free parameter reduces the ability of the CMB data to
constrain h and we obtain 0.26 < h < 0.97 with a best-fit value at h=0.40. We
obtain Omega_o=0.85 and set a lower limit Omega_o > 0.53. A strong correlation
between acceptable h and Omega_o values leads to a new constraint: Omega_o
h^1/2=0.55 +/- 0.10. A favored open model with Omega_o=0.3 and h=0.70 is more
than ~4 sigma from the CMB data best-fit model and is rejected at the 99% CL.
High baryonic models (Omega_b h^2 ~0.026) yield the best CMB chi-squared fits
and are more consistent with other cosmological constraints. The best-fit model
has n=0.91^{+0.29}_{-0.09} and Q=18.0^+1.2_-1.5 uK. The amplitude and position
of the dominant peak in the best-fit power spectrum are A_peak=76^+3_-7 uK and

``after-glow'', suggests that the relativistic shell which emitted the initial
GRB due to internal shocks decelerates on encountering an external medium,
giving rise to the after-glow. At a very early stage (few seconds), the
observed bolometric luminosity increases as t^2. On longer time scales (more
than about 10s), the luminosity drops as t^{-1}. If the main burst is long
enough, an intermediate stage of constant luminosity will form. In this case,
the after-glow overlaps the main burst, otherwise there is a time separation
between the two. On the long time scale, the flow decelerate in a self similar
way, reaching non relativistic velocities after about 30days. Due to the
deceleration and the accumulation of ISM material, the relation between the
observed time, the shock radius, and its Lorentz factor, is given by
t=R/16\gamma^2c which is a factor of 8 different from the usual expression. The
majority of particles are those of the original ejecta (and not the ISM) up to
about 900s. These particles reach sub-relativistic velocities on a time scale
of about 2hours, well before the flow becomes sub-relativistic. Therefore the
ejecta particles are probably unimportant for most of the after-glow radiation.
We show that even though only a small fraction of the energy is given to the
electrons, most of the energy can be radiated over time. If this fraction is
greater than 10% radiation losses will significantly influence the
hydrodynamical evolution at early times (less than 1day).

a clustering of extremely low-surface brightness objects of unknown nature.
With the Nancay decimetric radio telescope the radial velocity range of -529 to
1826 km/s was searched to an rms noise of ~3-5 mJy. Only three objects were
detected. However, their high radial velocities (between 600 and 1150 km/s)
show them to lie behind the M81 group. These three objects, classified as dS0:
(UGC 4998) and Im (Kar 1N and UGC 5658), have HI masses of 0.5, 2.0 and 2.5
10^8 Msun, for the assumed distance of 4 Mpc, and HI mass-to-blue light ratios
of 0.05, 0.91 and 0.22 Msun/LBsun, respectively. Considering that half of the
observed objects are classified as irregular dwarfs, hence expected to be
relatively gas-rich, the resulting detection rate of about 1/3 is quite low.
However, the mean redshift and velocity dispersion of the M81 group (<v> = 101
km/s, sigma=114 km/s) suggest that the HI emission of low velocity HI-rich
members of the M81 group may still remain hidden within the strong Galactic HI
emission (typically -150 < v < 115 km/s) or, for the 6 dwarf candidates in the
immediate vicinity of M81, overshadowed by the very extended HI envelope
encompassing M81, M82, NGC 3077, and NGC 2976 (-280 < v < 355 km/s).

nine objects are detected at 3.4 and 2.7 mm, with fluxes of 4-200 mJy, and
consist of unresolved (<3 arcsec) point sources, plus, toward about half of the
objects, an extended envelope. The point sources likely are circumstellar
disks, showing that these are established early in the embedded phase.
Literature values of 1.1 mm continuum emission are used to trace the envelopes,
carrying 0.001-0.26 M(sol). In HCO+, the 1-0 lines trace the surrounding
clouds, while the 3-2 and 4-3 are concentrated toward the sources with
intensities well correlated with the envelope flux. An HCO+/H2 abundance of
1.2e-8 is derived. The HCO+ line strengths and envelope fluxes can be fit
simultaneously with the simple collapse model of Shu (1977), and related
density power laws with slopes p=1-3. As an indicator of the relative
evolutionary phase of a YSO, the ratio of HCO+ 3-2 line intensity over
bolometric luminosity is proposed, which is roughly proportional to the current
ratio of envelope over stellar mass. It is concluded that HCO+ 3-2 and 4-3 are
excellent tracers of the early embedded phase of star formation.

then show that a quantum leap in performance is achieved when we further modify
the algorithms to better address some of the specific characteristics of the

be tolerated by either normalizing feature weights or by using negative
weights, (2) the positive effect of applying a threshold range in training, (3)
alternatives in considering feature frequency, and (4) the benefits of
discarding features while training. Overall, we present an algorithm, a

and surface tension interacting with a central black hole is studied. A careful
investigation of all classical solutions reveals that the value of the radius
of the shell and of the radial velocity as an initial datum does not determine
the motion of the shell; another configuration space must, therefore, be found.
A different problem is that the shell Hamiltonians used in literature are
complicated functions of momenta (non-local) and they are gauge dependent. To
solve these problems, the existence is proved of a gauge invariant
super-Hamiltonian that is quadratic in momenta and that generates the shell
equations of motion. The true Hamiltonians are shown to follow from the
super-Hamiltonian by a reduction procedure including a choice of gauge and
solution of constraint; one important step in the proof is a lemma stating that
the true Hamiltonians are uniquely determined (up to a canonical
transformation) by the equations of motion of the shell, the value of the total
energy of the system, and the choice of time coordinate along the shell. As an
example, the Kraus-Wilczek Hamiltonian is rederived from the super-Hamiltonian.
The super-Hamiltonian coincides with that of a fictitious particle moving in a
fixed two-dimensional Kruskal spacetime under the influence of two effective
potentials. The pair consisting of a point of this spacetime and a unit
timelike vector at the point, considered as an initial datum, determines a
unique motion of the shell.
