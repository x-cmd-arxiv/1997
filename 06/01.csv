  Journal (In press)",,"10.1086/304325",,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  Close to a black hole, the density of the sub-Keplerian accreting matter
becomes higher compared to a spherical flow due to the presence of a
centrifugal barrier independent of whether or not a standing shock actually
forms. This hot dense flow intercepts soft photons from a cold Keplerian disk
and reprocesses them to form high energy X-rays and gamma rays. We study the
spectral properties of various models of accretion disks where a Keplerian disk
on the equatorial plane may or may not be flanked by a sub-Keplerian disk and
the sub-Keplerian flow may or may not possess standing shocks. From comparison
with the spectra, we believe that the observed properties could be explained
better when both the components (Keplerian and sub-Keplerian) are
simultaneously present close to a black hole, even though the sub-Keplerian
halo component may have been produced out of the Keplerian disk itself at
larger radii. We are able to understand soft and hard states of black hole
candidates, properties of X-ray novae outbursts, and quasi-periodic
oscillations of black hole candidates using these two component models. We fit
spectra of X-ray novae GS1124-68 and GS2000+25 and satisfactorily reproduce the
light curves of these objects.

compute the partition functions of rods confined to spherical and cylindrical

them. The role of flexibility is investigated by considering chains composed of

flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link (POCL) planning. We
review this literature, and present new experimental results that generalize
the earlier work and explain some of the discrepancies in it. In particular, we
describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by
Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including
Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very
different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to
reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing
that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO
component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show
that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with
the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size,
and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a
strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain
characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.

choices among alternative approaches. I list some of these ``forks in the
road'' and offer reasons for taking one alternative over the other. In
particular, I advocate the following: the sum-over-histories framework for
quantum dynamics over the ``observable and state-vector'' framework; relative
probabilities over absolute ones; spacetime over space as the gravitational
``substance'' (4 over 3+1); a Lorentzian metric over a Riemannian
(``Euclidean'') one; a dynamical topology over an absolute one; degenerate
metrics over closed timelike curves to mediate topology-change; ``unimodular
gravity'' over the unrestricted functional integral; and taking a discrete
underlying structure (the causal set) rather than the differentiable manifold
as the basis of the theory.
  In connection with these choices, I also mention some results from unimodular
quantum cosmology, sketch an account of the origin of black hole entropy,
summarize an argument that the quantum mechanical measurement scheme breaks
down for quantum field theory, and offer a reason why the cosmological constant
of the present epoch might have a magnitude of around $10^{-120}$ in natural
units.

spectroscopy as an envelope of the transverse magnetization and should be
visible in the free induction decay signal. The period (approximately 1 sec) is
long enough for interference between the linear dynamics and collapse of the
wave-function induced by a Stern-Gerlach inhomogeneity to significantly alter
the shape of that envelope. Various dynamical collapse theories can be
distinguished by their observably different predictions with respect to this
alteration. Adverse effects of detuning due to the Stern-Gerlach inhomogeneity
can be reduced to an acceptable level by having a sufficiently thin sample or a
strong rf field.
