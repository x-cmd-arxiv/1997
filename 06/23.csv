contain signatures of the dynamics of the solar chromosphere that are uniquely
useful because of wavelength coverage, moderate signal-to-noise ratios, and
image stability. The dominant observed phenomenon is an oscillatory behavior
that is analogous to the 3 minute oscillations seen in Ca II lines. The
oscillations appear to be coherent over 3-8"". At any time they occur over
approx. 50 % of the area studied, and they appear as large perturbations in the
intensities of lines and continua. The oscillations are most clearly seen in
intensity variations in the UV (lambda > 912 A) continua, and they are also
seen in the intensities and velocities of chromospheric lines of C I, N I and O
I. Intensity brightenings are accompanied by blueshifts of typically 5 km
s$^{-1}$. Phase differences between continuum and line intensities also
indicate the presence of upward propagating waves. Three minute intensity
oscillations are occasionally seen in second spectra (C II 1335), but never in
third spectra (C III and Si III). Third spectra and He I 584 show oscillations
in velocity that are not simply related to the 3 minute oscillations. The
continuum intensity variations are consistent with recent simulations of
chromospheric dynamics (Carlsson & Stein 1994) while the line observations
indicate that important ingredients are missing at higher layers in the
simulations. The data show that time variations are crucial for our
understanding of the chromosphere itself and for the spectral features formed
there.

of an open universe is possible but it is not adequate for quantizing
perturbations in the one bubble universe, because of the lack of Cauchy
surfaces inside the bubble. Therefore we perform the reduction of the action
outside the lightcone emanating from the center of the bubble or nucleation
event, where the natural time constant hypersurfaces are no longer homogeneous
and isotropic and as a result the conventional classification of perturbations
in terms of scalar and tensor modes is not possible. Nevertheless, after
reduction of the action we find three decoupled actions for three independent
degrees of freedom, one of which corresponds to the scalar mode and the other
two to the tensor modes. Implications for the one bubble open inflationary

rotation curve until the outermost measured radial position. That is why a
general relation has been derived, giving the maximum rotation for a disc
depending on the luminosity, surface brightness, and colour of the disc. As a
physical basis of this relation serves an adopted fixed mass-to-light ratio as
a function of colour. That functionality is consistent with results from
population synthesis models and its absolute value is determined from the
observed stellar velocity dispersions. The derived maximum disc rotation is
compared with a number of observed maximum rotations, clearly demonstrating the
need for appreciable amounts of dark matter in the disc region and even more so

screen the f-moments when the temperature is reduced further, and the system

a very different appearance. In particular, states are now represented by
points of a symplectic manifold (which happens to have, in addition, a
compatible Riemannian metric), observables are represented by certain
real-valued functions on this space and the Schr\""odinger evolution is captured
by the symplectic flow generated by a Hamiltonian function. There is thus a
remarkable similarity with the standard symplectic formulation of classical
mechanics. Features---such as uncertainties and state vector reductions---which
are specific to quantum mechanics can also be formulated geometrically but now
refer to the Riemannian metric---a structure which is absent in classical
mechanics. The geometrical formulation sheds considerable light on a number of
issues such as the second quantization procedure, the role of coherent states
in semi-classical considerations and the WKB approximation. More importantly,
it suggests generalizations of quantum mechanics. The simplest among these are
equivalent to the dynamical generalizations that have appeared in the

below some critical value of the local energy density (or of some other

centrality of the collision), there is only nuclear absorption. Above this
critical value the absorptive cross-section is taken to be infinite, i.e. no

dissociates due both to nuclear absorption and to its interactions with

the string becomes a black hole. For smaller couplings it is entropically
favourable for the excitations to be vibrations of the string, while for larger
couplings the favoured excitations are pairs of solitonic 5-branes attached to
the string; this helps resolve some recently noted difficulties with matching
emission properties of the string to emission properties of the black hole. We
also examine the change of state when a black hole is placed in a spacetime

alpha-particle emission is studied. The calculations are performed for nuclei
at excitation energies from 80 MeV up to about 300 MeV. The nuclear fission is
described by a Langevin equation coupled to the Master equation for particle
evaporation. A significant influence of the initial spin distribution on the
prescission particles multiplicities is found.

deformation parameter q and they reduce to the classical structure constants of
a Lie algebra at $q=1$. We explain the relationship between the structure
constants of quantum Lie algebras and quantum Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for
adjoint x adjoint ---> adjoint. We present a practical method for the
determination of these quantum Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and are thus able to
give explicit expressions for the structure constants of the quantum Lie
algebras associated to the classical Lie algebras B_l, C_l and D_l.
  In the quantum case also the structure constants of the Cartan subalgebra are
non-zero and we observe that they are determined in terms of the simple quantum
roots. We introduce an invariant Killing form on the quantum Lie algebras and
find that it takes values which are simple q-deformations of the classical
ones.
