an important role in forming the radiation spectrum of many astrophysical

describes spontaneous and induced Compton scattering as well as absorption and
emission by static and moving media, the corresponding radiative transfer
equation, and their zeroth and first moments, in both the system frame and in
the frame comoving with the medium. We show that it is necessary to use the
correct relativistic differential scattering cross section in order to obtain a
photon kinetic equation that is correct to first order in epsilon/m_e, T_e/m_e,
and V, where epsilon is the photon energy, T_e and m_e are the electron
temperature and rest mass, and V is the electron bulk velocity in units of the
speed of light. We also demonstrate that the terms in the radiative transfer
equation that are second-order in V usually should be retained, because if the
radiation energy density is sufficiently large compared to the radiation flux,
the effects of bulk Comptonization described by the terms that are second-order
in V are at least as important as the effects described by the terms that are
first-order in V, even when V is small. Our equations are valid for systems of
arbitrary optical depth and can therefore be used in both the free-streaming

bulk motion occurs whether or not the radiation field is isotropic or the bulk
flow converges and that it is more important than thermal Comptonization if V^2

a blackbody of temperature 0.33 +/- 0.02 keV, together with an emission feature
at 1.05 +/- 0.02 keV. This spectral shape is similar to that observed by ASCA
during the spin-down phase, but significantly different from measurements
during spin-up. This suggests that the change in spectrum observed by ASCA may
be a stable feature during spin-down intervals. The source intensity is a
factor ~2 lower than observed by ASCA three years earlier, confirming that 4U

width and about 3 arcsec long. Its counterimage was identified and found to be
very compact r(1/2) = 2.4-4.0 / h50 kpc in a q0=0.05 cosmology). In addition,
we found three further multiple image systems, one with five and two with three
images each. The positions of the multiple images is explained by modelling the
light deflection caused by the cluster and the cD-galaxy with elliptical
isothermal potentials. Since the multiple images are within 8 arcsec around the
cD galaxy, a cluster core radius - cluster velocity dispersion degeneracy
arises. The cluster velocity dispersion and the core radius are limited to
540-670 km/s and 5 arcsec - 11\arcsec, respectively, and the brightness of the
unlensed counterimage of cB58 is about 23.9 +- 0.3 (R-band), corresponding to a
magnification and extinction corrected restframe-B band absolute magnitude of
-24.75 +- 0.7 mag. The redshifts of the sources of the remaining three multiple
image systems are predicted to be similar to that of cB58. That part of the
source of cB58 which is mapped into the arc is reconstructed and its
magnification is found to be mu(arc) > 50. This large magnification explains at
least some of the untypical spectroscopic properties of cB58, e.g. that the

fields of a Nielsen-Olesen string, and that one can think of such a vortex as
black hole ``hair''. In this paper, we examine the properties of an Abelian
Higgs vortex in the presence of a charged black hole as we allow the hole to
approach extremality. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we show
that the magnetic field lines (as well as the scalar field) of the vortex are
completely expelled from the black hole in the extreme limit. This was to be
expected, since extreme black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory are known to
exhibit such a ``Meissner effect'' in general. This would seem to imply that a
vortex does not want to be attached to an extreme black hole. We calculate the
total energy of the vortex fields in the presence of an extreme black hole.
When the hole is small relative to the size of the vortex, it is energetically
favoured for the hole to remain inside the vortex region, contrary to the
intuition that the hole should be expelled. However, as we allow the extreme
horizon radius to become very large compared to the radius of the vortex, we do
find evidence of an instability. This proves that it is energetically
unfavourable for a thin vortex to interact with a large extreme black hole.
This would seem to dispel the notion that a black hole can support `long'
abelian Higgs hair in the extreme limit. We show that these considerations do
not go through in the near extreme limit. Finally, we discuss whether this has
implications for strings that end at black holes.

the state which achieves this lower bound; the optimum lower bound differs by a

cosmology, and in particular pair creation amplitudes and radiative
transitions. To this end, we apply a double adiabatic development to the
solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation restricted to mini-superspace wherein
gravity is described by the scale factor $a$. The first development consists in
working with instantaneous eigenstates, in $a$, of the matter Hamiltonian. The
second development is applied to the gravitational part of the wave function
and generalizes the usual WKB approximation. We then obtain an exact equation
which replaces the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and determines the evolution, i.e.
the dependence in $a$, of the coefficients of this double expansion. When
working in the gravitational adiabatic approximation, the simplified equation
delivers the unitary evolution of transition amplitudes occurring among
instantaneous eigenstates. Upon abandoning this approximation, one finds that
there is an additional coupling among matter states living in expanding and
contracting universes. Moreover one has to face also the Klein paradox, i.e.
the generation of backward waves from an initially forward wave. The
interpretation and the consequences of these unusual features are only sketched
in the present paper. Finally, the examples of pair creation and radiative
transitions are analyzed in detail to establish when and how the above
mentioned unitary evolution coincides with the Schr\"" odinger evolution.

fluctuation can be thought of as the nucleation of a second domain wall of zero

first wall, annihilating both. The barrier factor for this quantum tunneling is
calculated by guessing and verifying a Euclidean instanton for the two-wall

O(N) field theory with unbroken symmetry in a spatially flat FRW universe to
study the dynamics of the inflaton in the post-inflaton, preheating stage.
Oscillations of the inflaton's zero mode induce parametric amplification of
quantum fluctuations, resulting in a rapid transfer of energy to the
inhomogeneous modes of the inflaton field. We adopt the coupled nonperturbative
equations for the mean field and variance derived in a preceding paper
[gr-qc/9706001] by means of a two-particle-irreducible (2PI), closed-time-path
(CTP) effective action for curved spacetime while specialized to leading order
in the 1/N expansion. Adiabatic regularization is employed. The renormalized
dynamical equations are evolved numerically from initial data which are generic
to the end state of slow roll in many inflatonary cosmological scenarios. The
initial conditions consist of a large-amplitude, quasiclassical, oscillating
mean field, and a variance given by the de Sitter-invariant vacuum. We find
that for sufficiently large initial mean-field amplitudes in this model, the
parametric resonance effect alone (in a collisionless approximation) is not an
efficient means to ""preheat"" the quantum field. For small initial mean-field
amplitude, damping of the mean field via parametric amplification of quantum
fluctuations is seen to occur. Our results indicate that the self-consistent
dynamics of spacetime plays an important role in determining the physics of the

proceed via gluon multiplication and quark production. The energy loss suffered
by the charm quarks is obtained by evaluating the drag force generated by the
scattering with quarks and gluons in the medium. We find that the charm quarks
may loose only about 10% of their initial energy in conditions likely to be
attained at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, while they may loose up to 40%
of their energy while propagating in the plasma created at Large Hadron
Collider. We discuss the implications for signals of quark gluon plasma.

particular in the system Au on Au at 1 GeV/nucleon are investigated. The
reaction dynamics is described within the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD)
approach. It is shown that high energy pions freeze out early and originate
from the hot, compressed matter. $N^*$--resonances are found to give an
important contribution toward the high energy tail of the pion. Further the
role of in-medium effects in the description of charged pion yields and spectra
is investigated using a microscopic potential derived from the Brueckner
G-matrix which is obtained with the Reid soft-core potential. It is seen that
the high energy part of the spectra is relatively more suppressed due to
in-medium effects as compared to the low energy part. A comparision to
experiments further demonstrates that the present calculations describe
reasonably well the neutral (TAPS) and charged (FOPI) pion spectra. The
observed energy dependence of the $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio, i.e. deviations from the
isobar model prediction, is due to Coulomb effects and again indicate that high
energy pions probe the hot and dense phase of the reaction. These findings are
confirmed independently by a simple phase space analysis.

interesting to find shell structures for the deformed shapes at some new $A$

experimental search of strangelets. The color projected (singlet) calculation
shows that even for the deformed shapes the shell structures vanish only for

treatment of the few-nucleon dynamics entailed a Faddeev-based calculation of
the reaction, with continuum calculations for the initial p-d state and
accurate solutions of the three-nucleon bound-state equation. The integral
cross-section was found to be quite sensitive to the NN interaction employed
while the angular dependence showed less sensitivity. Approximately a 4% effect
