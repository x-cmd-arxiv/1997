shows that when there is a slow invariant manifold subject to fast timescale
instability the dynamics are extremely sensitive to noise. The behaviour of
such systems can be described in terms of a one-dimensional map, and previous
work has shown how the effect of noise can be modelled by a simple adjustment
to the map. Here we undertake an in depth investigation of a particular set of
equations, using the methods of stochastic integration. We confirm the
prediction of the earlier studies that the noise becomes important when
mu|log(epsilon)| = O(1), where mu is the small timescale ratio and \epsilon is
the noise level. In addition, we present detailed information about the
statistics of the solution when the noise is a dominant effect; the analytical
results show excellent agreement with numerical simulations.

radio galaxy 53W002 at z=2.394. Maps at resolutions of 3 arcsec and 235km/s
show a significant emission peak within 0.5 arcsec of the optical and radio
continuum peaks. The measured narrow band flux is approximately ten times the
extrapolated cm-wavelength non-thermal radio continuum expected at 101.9 GHz
and exhibits a spectral profile implying a 540 km/s width (FWHM) at a systemic
redshift z=2.394 for CO (3-2). This emission has a total integrated flux of
1.51(+/-0.2) Jy km/s, approximately four times weaker than that previously seen
in the lensed systems FSC10214+4724 and the Cloverleaf QSO. For a Galactic
CO-to-H2 conversion ratio, the implied molecular gas mass is 7.4x10^10 solar
masses (H=75 km/s/Mpc and q=0.5). The CO emission is elongated at P.A.=120
degrees with a deconvolved major axis radius of 15 kpc (2.8 arcsec). This
extension is along a similar direction to that seen in the cm-wave radio
continuum and the optical but approximately three times larger. A velocity
gradient is seen along the major axis, and if this structure is a (forming)
disk, the implied dynamical mass is 9-22x10^10 solar masses at radii less than
or equal to 15 kpc, assuming inclination i=0 degrees (edge-on). The magnitude
of these masses and the similarity of the high gas-mass fraction are consistent
with the host galaxy of 53W002 being a young galactic system, but the
metallicity (probably greater than or equal to 0.1 solar in order to produce
the CO lines) implies significant heavy element production prior to z=2.4. This
constitutes the first high redshift molecular gas which is detected in emission
where there is probably no gravitational magnification.

binaries in the centers of galaxies, mainly to understand the factors affecting
the binary eccentricity, the response of the galaxy to the binary merger, and
the effect of loss-cone depletion on the merger time. The scattering
experiments from paper I showed that the merger time is not sensitive to the
eccentricity growth unless a binary forms with at least a moderate
eccentricity. We find here that the eccentricity can become large under some
conditions if a binary forms in a galaxy with a flat core or with a radial bias
in its velocity distribution, especially if the dynamical friction is enhanced
by resonances as suggested by Rauch and Tremaine (1996). But the necessary
conditions all seem unlikely, and our prediction from paper I remains
unchanged: in most cases the eccentricity will start and remain small. As a
binary hardens it ejects stars from the center of a galaxy, which may explain
why large elliptical galaxies have weaker density cusps than smaller galaxies.
If so, the central velocity distributions in those galaxies should have strong
tangential anisotropies. The wandering of a binary from the center of a galaxy
mitigates the problems associated with loss-cone depletion and helps the binary
merge.

uninterrupted days in May 1994. The campaign, which was coordinated with EUVE,
ROSAT, and ASCA monitoring, along with optical and radio observations from the
ground, yielded the largest set of spectra and the richest short time scale
variability information ever gathered for a blazar at UV wavelengths. The
source flared dramatically during the first day, with an increase by a factor
~2.2 in an hour and a half. In subsequent days, the flux maintained a nearly
constant level for ~5 days, then flared with ~35% amplitude for two days. The
same variability was seen in both short- and long-wavelength IUE light curves,
with zero formal lag (~<2 hr), except during the rapid initial flare, when the
variations were not resolved. Spectral index variations were small and not
clearly correlated with flux. The flux variability observed in the present
monitoring is so rapid that for the first time, based on the UV emission alone,
the traditional Delta L/Delta t limit indicating relativistic beaming is
exceeded. The most rapid variations, under the likely assumption of synchrotron
radiation, lead to a lower limit of 1 G on the magnetic field strength in the
UV emitting region. These results are compared with earlier intensive
monitoring of PKS 2155-304 with IUE in November 1991, when the UV flux
variations had completely different characteristics.

structure, a generalization of decision trees.
  To learn good parsing and translation decisions, our system relies heavily on
context, as encoded in currently 205 features describing the morphological,
syntactical and semantical aspects of a given parse state. Compared with recent
probabilistic systems that were trained on 40,000 sentences, our system relies
on more background knowledge and a deeper analysis, but radically fewer

at rest and their effect on the (positively and negatively) charged pion
spectrum. The in-medium corrections are due to Pauli blocking, which arises if
the Lambda(1405) is assumed to be a $\bar{K}$-nucleon bound state and leads to
a density and momentum dependent mass shift of the Lambda(1405). Requiring that
the optical potential as well as the branching ratio are derived from the same
elementary T-matrix, we find that the in-medium corrected, density dependent
T-matrix gives a better description of the K- absorption reaction than the
free, density-independent one. This result suggests that the dominant component
of the Lambda(1405) wave function is the $\bar{K}N$ bound state.
