keeping in mind recent progress in understanding of the flow behaviour near
compact objects. In an adiabatic spherical accretion on black holes and naked
singularities, standing shock waves do not form, but shocks on neutron stars
may or may not form depending on the boundary conditions. For low accretion
rates (hard state), these objects may behave similarly. However, for high
accretion rates (soft state), the converging flow on a black hole will produce
a weak hard tail of energy spectral slope of $\sim 1.5$ (apart from the soft
bump) while the flow on a neutron star or a naked singularity will have no hard
tail. The soft bumps of neutron star candidates may generally be at higher
energies than those of naked singularities.

nearby voids, based on a sample selected on the HQS (Hamburg Quasar Survey) -
III-aJ objective-prism plates. The survey was based on the presence of
emission-lines and therefore has the advantage to detect very faint objects
  (with all the flux in the emission-lines and almost no continuum), that would
be missed by an apparent magnitude limited survey. We found objects as faint as
B=20.5 and M(B)=(-15.0,-12.0).
  The observational data are given in Popescu et al. (1996) and in the present
paper we consider a complete subsample from these data. We analyse the spatial
distribution of our sample of ELGs in comparison with the distribution of
normal galaxies. Overall both distributions trace the same structures.
Nevertheless we also found a few ELGs in voids, from which at least 8 lie in
the very well defined nearby voids. The isolated galaxies seem to form fainter
structures that devide the larger voids into smaller ones. {}From our estimates
of the expected number of void galaxies we conclude that we did not find an
underlying homogenous void population.

standard second-order perturbation theory in the interaction U is used to
calculate the electronic self-energy and the quasi-particle density of states
(QDOS) in the bulk as well as in the vicinity of the surface. Within a
real-space representation we fully account for the non-locality of the
self-energy and examine the quality of the local approximation. Numerical
results are presented and discussed for the three different low-index surfaces
of the simple-cubic lattice. Compared with the bulk significant differences can
be found for the top-layer local self-energy, the imaginary part of which is
energetically narrowed and has a reduced total weight. The non-local parts of
the self-energy Sigma(ij)(E) decrease with increasing distance between the
sites i and j. At the surface and for the three-dimensional bulk their decrease
is faster than for a two-dimensional lattice. For all surfaces considered the
effects of the non-local parts of the self-energy on the QDOS are found to be
qualitatively the same as for the bulk: The weight of the quasi-particle
resonance at the Fermi energy is lowered while the high-energy
charge-excitation peaks become more pronounced. The main structures in the
layer-dependent spectra are already recovered within the local approximation;
taking into account the nearest-neighbor non-local parts turns out to be an
excellent approximation. Due to the reduced coordination number for sites at
the very surface, the top-layer QDOS is narrowed. Contrary to the the free
(U=0) system, quasi-particle damping results in a comparatively weak layer
dependence of the QDOS generally.

model. A proton in a nuclear target is struck by the incident electron and then
propagates through the residual nucleus suffering from soft interactions with
other nucleons. We call the proton ""dynamical"" when we take into account of
internal excitations, and ""inert"" when we freeze it to the ground state. When
the dynamical proton is struck with a hard (large-momentum transfer)
interaction, it shrinks, i.e., small-sized configuration dominates the process.
It then travels through nuclear medium as a time-dependent mixture of intrinsic
excited states and thus changing its size. Its absorption due to the soft
interactions with nuclear medium depends on its transverse-size. Since the
nuclear transparency is a measure of the absorption strength, we calculate it
in our model for the dynamical case, and compare the results with those for the
inert case. The effect of the internal dynamics is observed, which is in accord
with the idea of the ""color transparency"". We also compare our results with the
experimental data in regard of $q^2$-dependence as well as A-dependence, and

clearly.
