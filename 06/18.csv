relatively small integration time (about 3 orbits) would be sufficient to
detect the Lyman limit over a wide redshift range (0.3 < z < 2.2). Detection
(or non-detection) of the Lyman limit, in concert with ground-based
observations of nearby galaxies and Mg II and C IV absorption lines, should
provide meaningful constraints on the relationship of GRBs to galaxies.

  We conducted our studies using a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code, in which

  Global time-dependent quantities such as the total kinetic and thermal
energies and the radial extent are calculated for a grid of parameter sets. The
quantities calculated are the total energy, the kinetic energy, the thermal
energy, the radial extent, and the mass. We distinguished between the hot,
rarefied bubble and the cold, dense shell, as those two phases are distinct in
their roles in a gas-stellar system.
  We also present power-law fits to those quantities as a function of
environmental parameters after the extensive cooling has ceased. The power-law
fits enable simple incorporation of improved supernova energy input and matter
redistribution (including the effect of the local conditions) in
galactic/globular cluster models.
  Our results for the energetics of supernova remnants in the late stages of
their expansion give total energies ranging from 9e49 to 3e50 ergs, with a

to the optical emission-line object Ho 12. It is unclear if Ho 12 is an HII
region or a supernova remnant, although the latter interpretation is better
supported by the available optical data. The x-rays are unlikely to be direct
emission from a supernova remnant, due to the observed strong x-ray
variability. The x-ray spectrum of the source is very soft. Acceptable fits are
found for either a Raymond-Smith thermal model with kT = 0.56 keV, or a

their X-ray emission and their imprint on the images of background sources due
to their gravitational lensing effects. Since these projections of the
potential are weighted differently along the line-of-sight, we propose a method
to combine them and remove the degeneracy between two cases: (i) a cluster
consisting of a single potential well, or (ii) an apparent cluster composed of
several potential wells projected onto each other. We demonstrate with
simulated data of potential models that this method indeed allows to
significantly distinguish multiple from single clusters. The confidence limit
for this distinction depends on the mass ratio between the clusters. It ranges
from ~ 15 sigma for mass ratio 1:1 to ~ 4 sigma for mass ratio 1:6.
Furthermore, the method reconstructs the correct cluster mass, the correct mass
ratio of the two clusters, and the correct scale radii with typical fractional
accuracies of a few percent at 3 sigma confidence. As an aside, our method
allows to accurately determine gas fractions in clusters, also with 3 sigma
fractional accuracies of order a few percent. We argue that our method provides
an alternative to the commonly used beta-fit technique, and yields more

in two different ways. The first assumes that the hard X-ray continuum is the
reflection of the nuclear source by two, extended, photoionized gas components;
a warm (T$\sim 1.5 \times 10^5$ K) gas and a hot (T$\sim 3 \times 10^6$ K) gas.
All the observed emission lines are produced in this gas and there is an
additional, extended 0.6--3 keV pure continuum component. The second model is a
combination of a hard reflected continuum with a soft thermal plasma component.
The calculations show that the emission lines in the photoionized gas model are
in very good agreement with the observed ones assuming solar metallicity for
all elements except for iron, which is more than twice solar, and oxygen, which
is less than 0.25 solar. Models with solar oxygen are possible if the 0.5--1
keV continuum is weaker but they do not explain the magnesium and silicon
lines. The thermal model fit requires extremely low metallicity (0.04 solar)
for all elements. We discuss these findings and compare them with the ASCA
spectra of recently observed starburst galaxies. Given the strong H-like and
He-like lines, as well as the prominent Fe-L emission features, the origin of
the soft X-ray lines in this source is more likely photoionized gas. We compare
our model with the recent Iwasawa etal (1997) paper. We also show that
fluorescence lines of low-Z element lines in AGN is likely to be larger than

have conventionally been handled either by low order perturbation theory, for
lambda not too large, or by exact diagonalization within a finite basis of N
states. An adiabatic limit, as lambda is switched on arbitrarily slowly, has
been assumed. But the validity of these procedures seems questionable in view
of the fact that, as N goes to infinity, the quasienergy spectrum becomes
dense, and numerical calculations show an increasing number of weakly avoided
crossings (related in perturbation theory to high order resonances). This paper
deals with the highly non-trivial behavior of the solutions in this limit. The
Floquet states, and the associated quasienergies, become highly irregular
functions of the amplitude, lambda. The mathematical radii of convergence of
perturbation theory in lambda approach zero. There is no adiabatic limit of the
wave functions when lambda is turned on arbitrarily slowly. However, the
quasienergy becomes independent of time in this limit. We introduce a
modification of the adiabatic theorem. We explain why, in spite of the
pervasive pathologies of the Floquet states in the limit N goes to infinity,
the conventional approaches are appropriate in almost all physically
interesting situations.

models with backward scatterings, umklapp processes and couplings with 2k_F and
4k_F phonons (not static lattice distortion). We take a quarter- filled band
for M=Ag and a sixth-filled band coupled with a third-filled band for M=Cu.
Depending on electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling strengths, the
ground-state phase becomes a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid or a state with a
gap(s). For M=Ag, there appear a spin-gap state with a dominant 2k_F
charge-density-wave correlation, a Mott insulator with a dominant 4k_F
charge-density-wave correlation, or a spin-Peierls state with different
magnitudes of spin and charge gaps. Three-dimensionality is taken into account
by cutting off the logarithmic singularity in either the particle-particle
channel or the particle-hole channel. The difference between the ground-state
phase of the R_1=R_2=CH_3 salt (spin-Peierls state) and that of the R_1=R_2=I
salt (antiferromagnetic state) is qualitatively explained by a difference in
the cutoff energy in the particle-particle channel. For M=Cu, there appear a
Mott insulator with a charge density wave of period 3 and a Peierls insulator
with a charge density wave of period 6. The conditions for the experimentally
observed, Mott insulator phase are strong correlation in the sixth-filled band,
moderate electron-phonon couplings, and finite electron-4k_F phonon coupling.
Resistance is calculated as a function of temperature with a memory-function
approximation in both cases above. It qualitatively reproduces the differences
among the M=Ag and M=Cu cases as well as the R_1=R_2=CH_3 and R_1=R_2=I cases.

C*-algebras that can be described as the cross-sectional C*-algebra of a Fell
bundle. Several well known examples of non-commutative algebras, usually
obtained by deforming commutative ones by various methods, are shown to fit our
unified perspective of deformation via Fell bundles. Examples are the
non-commutative spheres of Matsumoto, the non-commutative lens spaces of
Matsumoto and Tomiyama, and the quantum Heisenberg manifolds of Rieffel. In a
special case, in which the deformation arises as a result of an action of
R^{2d}, assumed to be periodic in the first d variables, we show that we get a
strict deformation quantization.

factor belonging to the visible sector or is a U(1) factor belonging to the

spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern and on whether we have global or local
supersymmetry, inflation may be driven by the non-vanishing vacuum expectation
value of a F-term or by that of a D-term. In both scenarios cosmic strings form
at the end of inflation, and they have different properties in each model. Both
inflation and cosmic strings contribute to the CMBR temperature anisotropies.
We show that the strings contribute to the $C_l$'s up to the level of 75 %.
Hence the contribution from strings to the CMBR and to the density
perturbations in the early Universe which lead to structure formation cannot be

tailored for, (i) the consistent evaluation of fluctuations and correlations
and (ii) the restoration through projection of broken symmetries. For both
purposes we rely on a single variational principle which optimizes the
characteristic function. The Bloch equation is used as a constraint to define
the equilibrium state, and the trial quantities are a density operator and a
Lagrangian multiplier matrix which is akin to an observable. The conditions of
stationarity are respectively a Schr\""odinger-like equation and a Heisenberg--
like equation with an imaginary time running backwards. General conditions for
the trial spaces are stated that warrant the preservation of thermodynamic
relations. When the trial spaces are chosen to be of the
independent-quasi-particle type, the ensuing coupled equations provide an
extension of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation, which optimizes the
characteristic function. Variational expressions for thermodynamic quantities
or characteristic functions are also obtained with projected trial states,
whether an invariance symmetry is broken or not. In particular, the projection
on even or odd particle number is worked out for a pairing Hamiltonian, which
leads to new equations replacing the BCS ones. Qualitative differences between
even and odd systems, depending on the temperature $T$, the level density and
the strength of the pairing force, are investigated analytically and
numerically.

with orbital angular momentum $L\geq2 $ and the mixing angles with $J\geq2$ are
given parameterfree and thus allow for a detailed test of chiral symmetry in

corrections are too large as compared with empirical phase shifts, signaling
the increasing importance of shorter range effects in lower partial waves. For
higher partial waves, especially for G-waves, the model independent
$2\pi$-exchange corrections bring the chiral prediction close to empirical NN
phase shifts. We propose to use the chiral NN phase shifts with $L\geq 3$ as

satisfies a Boltzmann type kinetic equation containing a full nonlinear
electron-electron collision term as well as linear terms representing
collisions with reservoir particles having a specified Maxwellian distribution.
We show that when the constant in front of the nonlinear collision kernel,
thought of as a scaling parameter, is sufficiently strong, then the $L^1$
distance between $f$ and a certain time dependent Maxwellian stays small
uniformly in $t$. Moreover, the mean and variance of this time dependent
Maxwellian satisfy a coupled set of nonlinear ODE's that constitute the
``hydrodynamical'' equations for this kinetic system. This remain true even
when these ODE's have non-unique equilibria, thus proving the existence of
multiple stabe stationary solutions for the full kinetic model. Our approach
relies on scale independent estimates for the kinetic equation, and entropy
production estimates. The novel aspects of this approach may be useful in other
problems concerning the relation between the kinetic and hydrodynamic scales
globably in time.
