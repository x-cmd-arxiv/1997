its expansion eventually to be halted, comes principally from dynamical studies
of large-scale structure. These studies either use the observed peculiar
velocity field of galaxies directly, or indirectly by quantifying its
anisotropic effect on galaxy clustering in redshift surveys. A potential
difficulty with both such approaches is that the density parameter $\Omega_0$
is obtained only in the combination $\beta = \Omega_0^{0.6}/b$, if linear
perturbation theory is used. The determination of the density parameter
$\Omega_0$ is therefore compromised by the lack of a good measurement of the
bias parameter $b$, which relates the clustering of sample galaxies to the
clustering of mass.
  In this paper, we develop an idea of Fry (1994), using second-order
perturbation theory to investigate how to measure the bias parameter on large
scales. The use of higher-order statistics allows the degeneracy between $b$
and $\Omega_0$ to be lifted, and an unambiguous determination of $\Omega_0$
then becomes possible. We apply a likelihood approach to the bispectrum, the
three-point function in Fourier space. This paper is the first step in turning
the idea into a practical proposition for redshift surveys, and is principally
concerned with noise properties of the bispectrum, which are non-trivial. The
calculation of the required bispectrum covariances involves the six-point
function, including many noise terms, for which we have developed a generating
functional approach which will be of value in calculating high-order statistics
in general.

evidence that the maser spots are concentrated in a thin molecular disk which
is clumpy, and find the accretion rate to be about $1.5\times 10^{-3}$ solar

involve bifurcating periodic orbits, families of invariant curves, and tori,

necessarily real and a joint probability density function of complex
eigenvalues can characterize basic properties of the systems. This function is
studied using the supersymmetry technique and a supermatrix $\sigma$-model is
derived. The $\sigma$-model differs from already known by a new term. The
zero-dimensional version of the $\sigma$-model turns out to be the same as that
obtained recently for ensembles of random weakly non-Hermitian or asymmetric
real matrices. Using a new parametrization for the supermatrix $Q$ the density
of complex eigenvalues is calculated in $0D$ for both the unitary and
orthogonal ensembles. The function is drastically different in these two cases.
It is everywhere smooth for the unitary ensemble but has a $\delta$-functional
contribution for the orthogonal one. This anomalous part means that a finite
portion of eigenvalues remains real at any degree of the non-Hermiticity. All

investigated by taking unexpanded exchange couplings. Several dimerized
configurations are considered some of which are shown to have lower ground
state energies than others. In particular, the lattice deformations resulting
in alternate strong and weak couplings along both the principal axes of a
square lattice are shown to result in a larger gain in energy. In addition, a
`columnar' configuration is shown to have a lower ground state energy and a
faster increase in the energy gap parameter than a `staggered' configuration.
The inclusion of unexpanded exchange coupling leads to a power law behaviour
for the magnetic energy gain and the spin-Peierls gap, which is qualitatively
different from that reported earlier. Instead of varying as $\delta ^x$, the
two quantities are shown proportional to $\delta ^\nu / |ln \delta|.$ It is
thus proposed that the logarithmic correction, that was regarded as an outcome
of including umklapp processes for small distortions, can also be a direct
consequence of using an un-truncated spin-spin exchange interaction. The
calculations, which employ the coupled cluster method, lead to a conclusion
result that the dimerization of a spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a

when $a(\phi)$ has a minimum (i.e., when the theory evolves towards general

quantitavely the $B$ semileptonic branching ratios to the ground state and
orbitally excited charmed mesons $D, D^\ast$ and $D^{\ast\ast}$. We check
Bjorken's sum rule and discuss the respective contributions to it. We find
$\xi(w)\simeq (2/(1+w)) ^2$, resulting from the fact that the ground state wave
function is Coulomb-like. We also find $\tau_{3/2}\simeq 0.5 (2/(1+w))^3$ and
$\tau_{1/2}(w)\ll \tau_{3/2}(w)$. Very small branching ratios into $j=1/2$
orbitally excited $D$'s results. The overall agreement with experiment is
rather good within the present accuracy which is poor for the orbitally excited
charmed mesons. We predict a ratio $Br(B\to D^\ast_2 l \nu)/Br(B\to D_1 l
\nu)=1.55\pm 0.15$ as a mere consequence of the heavy quark symmetry. If some
faint experimental indications that $Br(B\to D_1 l \nu)\simeq Br(B\to D^\ast_2
l \nu)$ were confirmed, it would indicate a sizeable $O(1/m_c)$ correction.

dilaton/moduli stabilization, supersymmetry breaking (by hidden-sector gaugino
condensation), gauge coupling unification (or the Newton's constant), QCD
axion, as well as cosmological problems. We study these problems by adopting
the viewpoint that they arise mostly due to our limited calculational power,
little knowledge of the vacuum structure, and an inappropriate treatment of
gaugino condensation. It turns out that these problems can be solved or are
much less severe after a more consistent and complete treatment. There are two
kinds of non-perturbative effects in the construction of effective field
theory: the field-theoretical non-perturbative effects of gaugino condensation
(with a constraint ignored in the past) and the stringy non-perturbative
effects conjectured by Shenker, which are best described using the linear
multiplet formalism. Stringy non-perturbative corrections to the K\""ahler
potential are invoked to stabilize the dilaton at a value compatible with a
weak coupling regime. Modular invariance is ensured through the Green-Schwarz
counterterm and string threshold corrections which, together with hidden matter
condensation, lead to moduli stabilization at the self-dual point where the
vev's of moduli's F-components vanish. In the vacuum, supersymmetry is broken
at a realistic scale with vanishing cosmological constant. As for soft
supersymmetry breaking, our model always leads to a dilaton-dominated scenario.
For the strong CP problem, the model-independent axion has the right properties
to be the QCD axion. Furthermore, there is a natural mass hierarchy between the
dilaton/moduli and the gravitino, which could solve the cosmological moduli
problem and the cosmological problem of the model-independent axion.

is shown to be very small for proton rich bubbles with a moderately large outer
radius. Metastable islands of nuclear bubbles are shown to exist for nucleon in
the range A=450 - 3000.

equilibrium and evaluate the life-time of the deuteron fluctuations within the
linear response theory. To this end we derive a generalized linear Boltzmann
equation where the collision integral is related to equilibrium correlation
functions. In this framework we then utilize finite temperature Green functions
to evaluate the collision integrals. The elementary reaction cross section is
evaluated within the Faddeev approach that is suitably modified to reflect the
properties of the surrounding hot and dense matter.

principal quantum numbers 11 <= n <= 25 by Doppler-free two-photon excitation
combined with thermionic detection. Based on the more accurate data, compared
to previous results, the hyperfine structure was analysed by second order
perturbation theory using MQDT wavefunctions. As a result we find that the
surprisingly large B-factors obtained by fitting the data with the Casimir
formula do not reflect a quadrupolar interaction but rather consist
predominantly of second order magnetic dipole contributions. Further,
inconsistencies in the King plot of odd-even isotope shifts were removed by
this type of analysis. The result demonstrates the importance of higher order
effects in hyperfine splittings of excited states in atoms with two valence
electrons, even when the fine structure splitting is large compared to the
hyperfine splitting.
