interstellar extinction toward the binary (Av=5) contrasts the variable N_H
inferred from X-ray measurements, most likely evidence for a stellar wind. The
mass donor is probably near the tip of the first-ascent red giant branch, in
which case the system is 3-6 kpc distant and has an X-ray luminosity of 10^37

beginning its ascent of the asymptotic giant branch, in which case the system
is 12-15 kpc distant and has an X-ray luminosity of 10^38 erg/s. However, our
measured Av argues against such a large distance. We show that the dense (10^9

from an accretion disk. The emission-line spectrum constrains the temperature
and inner radius of the disk (and thus the pulsar's magnetic field strength),

likely >260 d, making GX 1+4 the only known LMXB with Porb>10 d. If the mass
donor fills its Roche lobe, the mass transfer must be highly super-Eddington,
requiring much mass loss from the binary. We discuss the alternative that the
disk forms from the slow, dense stellar wind expected from the red giant.

of multiphase (inhomogeneous) hot interstellar medium (ISM) in elliptical
galaxies. We assume the gases ejected from stars do not mix globally with the
circumferential gas. The ejected gas components evolve separately according to
their birth time, position, and origin. We consider cases where supernova
remnants (SNRs) mix with local ISM. The components with high metal abundance
and/or high density cool and drop out of the hot ISM gas faster than the other
components because of their high metal abundance and/or density. This makes the
average metal abundance of the hot ISM low. Furthermore, since the metal
abundance of mass-loss gas decreases with radius, gas inflow from outer region
makes the average metal abundance of the hot ISM smaller than that of mass-loss
gas in the inner region. As gas ejection rate of stellar system decreases, mass
fraction of mass-loss gas ejected at outer region increases in a galaxy. If the
mixing of SNRs is ineffective, our model predicts that observed [Si/Fe] and
[Mg/Fe] should decrease towards the galactic center because of strong iron
emission by SNRs. In the outer region, where the cooling of time of the ISM is
long, the selective cooling is ineffective and most of gas components remain
hot. Thus, the metal abundance of the ISM in this region directly reflects that
of the gas ejected from stars. Our model shows that supernovae are not
effective heating sources in the inner region of elliptical galaxies, because
most of the energy released by them radiates. Therefore, cooling flow is
established even if the supernova rate is high. Mixing of SNRs with ambient ISM
makes the energy transfer between supernova explosion and ambient ISM more
effective.

variance that were originally obtained using diagrammatic perturbation theory.
At this level of approximation the current distribution can be shown to be
strictly Gaussian. The nonlinear sigma model provides a systematic way of
calculating higher-order contributions to the current moments. An explicit
calculation for the average current of the first term beyond Gaussian order
shows that it is small compared to the Gaussian result; an order-of-magnitude
estimation indicates that the same is true for all higher-order contributions

theories of gravity is given in terms of the frequencies of quasi-normal modes.
The scalar-tensor theories have a scalar field which is related to gravitation.
There is an arbitrary function, the so-called coupling function, which
determines the strength of the coupling between the gravitational scalar field
and matter. Instability is induced by the scalar field for some ranges of the
value of the first derivative of the coupling function. This instability leads
to significant discrepancies with the results of binary-pulsar-timing
experiments and hence, by the stability analysis, we can exclude the ranges of
the first derivative of the coupling function in which the instability sets in.
In this article, the constraint on the first derivative of the coupling
function from the stability of relativistic stars is found. Analysis in terms
of the quasi-normal mode frequencies accounts for the parameter dependence of
the wave form of the scalar gravitational waves emitted from the
Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse. The spontaneous scalarization is also discussed.

vacuum the solution of the classical Euclidean equation of motion of the

taken into account already in the equation of motion. Hence, the latter one has
to be the functional derivative of the effective action with respect to the
background field. This is of crucial importance in theories in which the
symmetry breaking is due to radiative corrections. Usually the effective
potential is considered only, neglecting the corrections due to the derivative
terms of the effective action. In this article a bounce solution from an
equation of motion which takes into account the full effective action in the
one-loop approximation is calculated. A computational method that yields a
strict separation of the divergent contributions to the effective action from
the convergent ones is obtained. This allows a wide freedom in the choice of
regularization and renormalization schemes. The model under consideration is
the SU(2)-Higgs model. The fluctuations of the complete bosonic sector, i.e.
gauge field, Higgs and Goldstone boson contributions, are taken into account.
The bounce is then self-consistent to one-loop order. The obtained results for
characteristic quantities of the transition as the nucleation rate and the
number of nucleated bubbles per volume are compared to other,
non-self-consistent approaches.

supersymmetric flat directions the gauge symmetry is broken down to SU(2) due
to the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs fields on one of the end points.
The remaining massless mode on the other end point acquires a potential due to
a massive five dimensional state propagating between the end points. This
potential breaks the SU(2) symmetry at an exponentially suppressed scale
compared to the SU(3) breaking scale. The suppression factor depends
exponentially on the mass M of the massive state and the length $\pi R$ of the

endpoints of the curve segments and a singular point of Poincare index 1 at
infinity. The rank r of the vector bundle over the Riemann sphere on which they
act equals the number of distinct terms in the exponential sums entering in the
numerator of the integral kernels. The deformation equations may be viewed as
nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems on an auxiliary symplectic vector space M,
whose Poisson quotient, under a parametric family of Hamiltonian group actions,
is identified with a Poisson submanifold of the loop algebra Lgl_R(r) with
respect to the rational R-matrix structure. The matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem
method is used to identify the auxiliary space M with the data defining the
integral kernel of the resolvent operator at the endpoints of the curve
segments. A second associated isomonodromic family of covariant derivative
operators D_z is derived, having rank n=2m, and r finite regular singular
points at the values of the exponents defining the kernel of K. This family is
similarly embedded into the algebra Lgl_R(n) through a dual parametric family
of Poisson quotients of M. The operators D_z are shown to be analogously
associated to the integral operator obtained from K through a Fourier-Laplace
transform.
