simulations. Starting from an initial planset for the routes, the route-based
microsimulation is executed. The result of the microsimulation is fed into a
re-router, which re-routes a certain percentage of all trips. This approach
makes the traffic patterns in the microsimulation much more reasonable.
Further, it is shown that the method described in this paper can lead to strong
oscillations in the solutions.

after the burst and faded away in a few days with a power law decay function.
The energetic content of the X-ray afterglow results to be a significant

imaging of GRB970228 started a multiwavelength campaign that lead to the
identification of a fading optical source in a position consistent with the

the finding that hadronic total cross sections as well as elastic cross s

the factorization property. However, due to Pomeron intercept being greater

a classical triple-Pomeron formula is too large leading to a potential
unitarity violation at Tevatron energies. It is our desire here to examine
carefully the notion of Pomeron flux renormalization, proposed by Goulianos,

implementation of final-state screening correction, with ""flavoring"" for
Pomeron as the primary dynamical mechanism for setting the relevant energy s

Pomeron flux"", initia l-state screening remains unimportant, consistent with

satisfied by requiring RR charge conservation for the various type IIA fields.
The construction allows us to study a curious phase transition in which the
number of flavors in supersymmetric QCD depends on the value of the ten
dimensional cosmological constant. These phenomena are related to the fact that
every time a D8-brane crosses a NS brane, a D6-brane is created in between

"physics/9706011",,"J. Luscombe","Quantum interference and particle trajectories","17 pages pdf format, e-mail 102650.645@compuserve.com",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The existence of precise particle trajectories in any quantum state is
accounted for in a consistent way by allowing delocalization of the particle
charge. The relativistic mass of the particle remains within a small volume
surrounding a singularity moving along the particle trajectory. The singularity
is the source of an electric displacement field. The field induces a
polarization charge in the vacuum and this charge is equated with the charge of
the particle. Under dynamic conditions a distributed charge density rho(x,t) is
induced in the vacuum. The volume integral of the charge density is equal to
the charge of the particle and is rigorously conserved. The charge density is
derived from a complex-valued physical field psi(x,t) such that rho(x,t) =
|psi(x,t)|^2. The position probability density is equated with the mean charge
density. The mean field psi(x,t) for many sample realizations with a given
energy E and potential V(x) is the sum of the individual fields. In order for
the sum to be non-zero, the components in the spectral decompositions of the
individual fields must be spatially coherent. The particle has a spin frequency
given by Planck's relation hv = T - V + mc^2, where T is the kinetic energy,
determined from the momentum p and V is a quantum potential such that E = T + V
is conserved. The instantaneous phase of the spin is given by the phase of
exp(ikx) in the spectral decomposition a(k) of psi(x,t). It is spatially
coherent, due to the dependence on x. The momentum probability distribution is
given by the squared magnitude of the coefficients a(k). The Schrodinger
equation is derived by requiring local conservation of mean energy.

for the first time, a novel grand unification with the inclusion of gravity for
matter embedded in the generalized positive-definite units of unified gauge
theories while gravity for antimatter is embedded in the isodual isounit. We
then show that the proposed grand unification provides realistic possibilities
for a resolution of the axiomatic incompatibilities between gravitation and
electroweak interactions due to curvature, antimatter and the fundamental
space-time symmetries.
