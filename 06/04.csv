combination of archival HST/WFPC2 data, recent IRAM CO(7-6) maps and wide field
CFHT/FOCAM images. The deepest WFPC2 observation shows a significant
overdensity of I ~ 23--25 galaxies around the Cloverleaf that we interpret as
the presence of a cluster of galaxies along the line of sight. The typical
magnitude, red color (R-I ~ 0.9) and small angular size of these galaxies
suggest that the cluster is very distant and could be associated with the
absorption systems observed in the spectra of the quasar spots. The Cloverleaf
is probably the result of the lensing effects of a system which includes a
single-galaxy and one of the most distant cluster of galaxies. We have modelled
the lens using altogether the WFPC2 data and the IRAM/CO(7-6) map, considereing
two cases: one in which the mass model is a galaxy and a dark halo at z=1.7,
and a second one in which the mass model is the combination of a cluster and an
individual galaxy located amid the Cloverleaf, both at z=1.7. The CO source is
found to form a ring-like structure orbiting the central engine at ~ 100km/s at
a radial distance of ~ 100pc, leading to a black-hole mass of ~ 10^9 M_solar.
The cluster component increases significantly the convergence of the lens and
this pulls down the requirement on the mass of the lensing galaxy by a factor
2. This may explain the mystery of the lensing galaxy not detected yet.

description with 2N flavors. Specifically, we investigate a free theory of 2N

larger U(2N) invariance. However, when the axial anomaly is accounted for in
the effective theory by a 't Hooft interaction, only SU(N)_L X SU(N)_R X U(1)_B
\subset U(2N) survives. There is however a residual discrete symmetry that is
not a symmetry of the QCD lagrangian. This S_2 subgroup of U(2N) has many
interesting properties. For instance, when explicit chiral symmetry breaking
effects are present, S_2 is broken unless \bar\theta=0 or pi. By expressing the
free theory on the light-front, we show that flavor doubling implies several
superconvergence relations in pion-hadron scattering. Implicit in the 2N-flavor
effective theory is a Regge trajectory with vacuum quantum numbers and unit
intercept whose behavior is constrained by S_2. In particular, S_2 implies that
forward pion-hadron scattering becomes purely elastic at high-energies, in good
agreement with experiment.

$\exp(\pi (M^2 - m^2)/eE)$. Thus, in the limit $(M-m)/M \to 0$, one recovers
Unruh's result characterized by the temperature $a/2\pi$ where $a$ is the

prevents a simple description of the equilibrium state. However, in the limit

and possibly chaos. Here a variation on the delayed oscillator is explored. In
this stochastic-oscillator view, El Nino is a stable mode excited by noise. It
is shown that the autocorrelation function of the observed NINO3.4 index is
that of a stochastic oscillator, within the measurement uncertainty. Decadal
variations as would occur in a stochastic oscillator are shown to be comparable
to those observed, only the increase in the long-term mean around 1980 is
rather large. The observed dependence of the seasonal cycle on the variance and
the correlation is so large that it can not be attributed to the natural
variability of a stationary stochastic oscillator. So the El Ni\~{n}o
stochastic-oscillator parameters must depend on the season. A forecast model
based on the stochastic oscillator with a variance that depends on the season

using only 18 four-dimensional vectors, which is a record for this kind of
proof. This set of vectors contains subsets which allow us to develop a
``state-specific'' proof with 10 vectors (also a record) and a
``probabilistic'' proof with 7 vectors which reflects the algebraic structure
of Hardy's nonlocality theorem.

question of how much information about a perturbing environment is needed to
keep the entropy of a Hamiltonian system from increasing. In this paper we give

requires a quantum mechanical description of systems that carry out theoretical
calculations and experiments. The description of quantum computers is under
active development. No description of systems to carry out experiments has been
given. A small step in this direction is taken here by giving a description of
quantum robots as mobile systems with on board quantum computers that interact
with environments. Some properties of these systems are discussed. A specific
model based on the literature descriptions of quantum Turing machines is
presented.
