(Mach number 1.5) HI clouds, in a standard Two-phase ISM (T_cl = 74 K, n_cl =

radiative cooling parameter \eta = t_rad/t_coll (t_coll=R_c/v_c), evolutionary
modifications on the cloud structure (by colliding clouds ``evolved'' through
independent motion within the intercloud medium (WIM)), and the symmetry of the
problem (by colliding initially identical clouds, evolved to different ages
before impact). The presence of bow shocks and ram pressure from material in
the cloud wake, developed during such evolution through the WIM, significantly
alters these interactions with respect to the standard case of non-evolved
clouds.
  In general, in our adiabatic collisions the clouds are disrupted and convert
their gas into a few low density contrast clumps. By contrast, for symmetric
radiative cases we find that the two clouds coalesce, with almost all the
initial kinetic energy radiated away. On the other hand, for both adiabatic and
radiative collisions, asymmetric collisions have a much greater tendency to
disrupt the two clouds. Fragmentation of the clouds may occur, and
instabilities are in general enhanced. In addition, radiative cooling is less
efficient in our asymmetric interactions, so that those parts of the clouds
that initially seem to merge are more likely to re-expand and fade into the
WIM. Since the majority of real cloud collisions should be asymmetric for one
reason or another, we conclude that most gasdynamical diffuse cloud collisions
will be disruptive, at least in the absence of significant self-gravity or of a
significant magnetic field.

a point where it is seen to truncate dramatically in the best observed cases.
It was anticipated that if the ambient radiation field is sufficiently strong,
there exists a maximum radius beyond which the cold gas is unable to support
itself against ionization. We have now succeeded in detecting ionized gas
beyond the observed HI disk in spirals. Here, we report on our findings for the
Sculptor galaxy NGC 253. The HI disks in Sculptor galaxies extend to only about
1.2 R_25 although we have detected ionized gas to the limits of our survey out
to 1.4 R_25. This has important ramifications for spiral galaxies in that it
now becomes possible to trace the gravitational potential beyond where the HI
disk ends. The detections confirm that the rotation curve continues to rise in
NGC 253, as it appears to do for other Sculptor galaxies from the HI
measurements, but there is a hint that the rotation curve may fall abruptly not
far beyond the edge of the HI disk. If this is correct, then it suggests that
the dark halo of NGC 253 may be truncated near the HI edge, and provides
further support for the link between dark matter and HI. The line ratios are
anomalous with [NII]6548/H-alpha ratios close to unity. While metallicities at
these large radii are uncertain, such enhanced ratios compared to
solar-abundance HII regions ([NII]/H-alpha = 0.05-0.2) are likely to require
selective heating of the electron population without further ionization of

x-ray to radio wavelengths. Detailed kinematic and polarization studies have
shown that this activity is confined to bipolar cones centered on the AGN which
intersect the plane of the disk. Thus, molecular clouds at 1 kpc distance along
this axis are an important probe of the nuclear ionizing luminosity and
spectrum. Extended MIR emission coincident with the clouds is reasonably
understood by dust heated to high temperatures by the nuclear radiation field.
This model predicts that the nuclear spectrum is quasar-like (power law + blue
excess) with a luminosity 2-5 times higher than inferred by Pier et al.
Consequently, there is little or no polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission
associated with the radio-axis molecular clouds. We review this model in the
light of new observations. A multi-waveband collage is included to illustrate
the possible orientations of the double cones to our line of sight and the

be very stable and no residual power is left in the power spectrum. During the

length. The predictions are tested by considering long, finite-width strips of
Ising spins with randomly distributed ferromagnetic couplings, along which free
energy, spin-spin correlation functions and specific heats are calculated by
transfer-matrix methods. The ratio $\gamma/\nu$ is calculated and has the same
value as in the pure case; consequently conformal invariance predictions remain
valid for this type of disorder. Semilogarithmic plots of correlation functions
against distance yield average correlation lengths $\xi^{av}$, whose size
dependence agrees very well with the proposed theory. We also examine the size
dependence of the specific heat, which clearly suggestsa divergency in the
thermodynamic limit. Thus our data consistently favour the Dotsenko-Shalaev
picture of logarithmic corrections (enhancements) to pure system singularities,

a modified Smoluchowski equation for the distribution N(s,t) of droplets masses

and injection of small droplets when the model allows renucleation. The
corresponding collision kernel is derived in both cases. For a generic
collision kernel K, the equation describes a clustering process with clusters
of mass s growing between collision with ds/dt=As^\beta$, and injection of
monomers at a rate I(t). General properties of this equation are studied. The
gel criterion is determined. Without injection, exact solutions are found with
a constant kernel, exhibiting unusual scaling behavior. For a general kernel,
under the scaling assumption N(s,t)\sim Y(t)^{-1}f(s/S(t)), we determine the
asymptotics of S(t) and Y(t), and derive the scaling equation. Depending on
\beta and K, a great diversity of behaviors is found. For constant injection,
there is an asymptotic steady state with N(s,t=\infty)\propto s^{-\tau} and

homogeneous nucleation and is studied. Finally, we show how these results shed

collisions is considered within the framework of a space-time description,
combining parton-cascade evolution with a coalescence model for bound-state
formation. The `hard' production of the initial QQbar, directly or via gluon
fragmentation and including both color-singlet and color-octet contributions,
is calculated from the PQCD cross-sections. The subsequent development of the
QQbar system is described within a space-time generalization of the DGLAP
parton-evolution formalism in position- and momentum-space. The actual
formation of the bound-states is accomplished through overlap of the QQbar pair
and a spectrum of quarkonium wave-functions. This coalescence can only occur
after sufficent gluon radiation reduces the QQbar relative velocity to a value
commensurate with the non-relativistic kinematics of these bound systems. The
presence of gluon participants in the cascade then is both necessary and leads
to the natural inclusion of both color-singlet and color-octet mechanisms. The
application of this approach to pp (ppbar) collisions from sqrt(s)= 30 GeV - 14
TeV reveals very decent agreement with available data from ISR and Tevatron -
without the necessity of introducing fit parameters. Moreover, production
probabilities are calculated for a complete spectrum of charmonium and
bottonium states, with the relative significance compared to open charm
(bottom) production. An analysis of the space-time development is carried
through which sheds light on the relevance of gluon radiation and
color-structure, suggesting a correponding experimental investigation.

effective action for 2D quantum dilaton-scalar gravity is also found. These 2D
results maybe applied for analysis of 4D spherical collapse. The role of new,
dilaton dependent terms in trace anomaly for 2D black holes and Hawking
radiation is investigated in some specific models of dilatonic gravity which
represent modification of CGHS model. The conformal sector for 4D dilatonic
gravity is constructed. Quantum back-reaction of dilaton coupled matter is
briefly discussed (it may lead to the inflationary Universe with non-trivial
dilaton).

N_f=1,2,3 $ massive quark hypermultiplets. We compute the curves of marginal
stability with the help of the explicit solutions for the low energy effective
actions in terms of standard elliptic functions. We show that only a few of
these curves are relevant. As a generic example, the case of $ N_f=2 $ with two
equal bare masses is studied in depth. We determine the precise existence
domains for each BPS state, and show how they are compatible with the RG flows.
At the superconformal point, where two singularities coincide, we prove that
(for $ N_f=2 $) the massless spectrum consists of four distinct BPS states and
is S-invariant. This is due to the monodromy around the superconformal point
being S, providing strong evidence for exact S-duality of the SCFT. For all $
N_f $, we compute the slopes $ \omega $ of the $ \beta $-functions at the fixed
point couplings and show that they are related to the anomalous dimensions $

provided that this model exists and there is no model with a Woodin cardinal.
  This basic result is improved in two directions. First, we prove the same
result for delta-Jonsson and delta-Erdos cardinals, where delta is any regular
cardinal smaller than kappa. These notions correspond to Jonsson and Erdos
cardinals, except that the submodel or set of indiscernibles is only required
to have ordertype delta. The delta-Jonsson cardinals come up in the stationary
tower forcing.
  Second, we weaken the assumption that the Steel core model exists by showing
that if the universe is a generic extension of L[\vec E] and there is no model
with at Woodin cardinal then the model L[E] can take the place of the Steel
core model. It follows as a corollary that if L[\vec E] is a minimal model for
a Woodin cardinal then every delta-Jonsson cardinal in L[\vec E] is
delta-Erdos.

distributions the MQMC model can be cast in a form identical to QHD by a
redefinition of the sigma meson field. It is then clear that modifications
similar to those introduced in QHD will permit the reproduction of all nuclear
matter properties including the compressibility. After calibrating the model
parameters at equilibrium nuclear matter density, the model and parameter
dependence of the resulting equation of state is examined. Nucleon properties
and scaling relations between the bag constant and the effective nucleon mass

dibaryon states with J$^{\pi} = 1^+$, J$^{\pi} = 0^+$, I=1 (27plet) are nearly
degenerate with the J$^{\pi} = 0^+$, I=0 singlet $H_0$ dibaryon, which has been
predicted to be stable against strong decay, but has not been observed. Our
calculation, which does not require an instanton correction, suggests that the
$H_0$ is slightly heavier than these flavor-nonsinglet $H$s over a wide range
of the parameter space. If the singlet $H_0$ mass lies above the $\Lambda
\Lambda$ threshold (2231~MeV), then the strong interaction breakup to $\Lambda
\Lambda$ would produce a very broad resonance in the $\Lambda \Lambda$
invariant mass spectrum which would be very difficult to observe. On the other
hand, if these flavor-nonsinglet J=0 and 1 $H$ dibaryons are also above the
$\Lambda \Lambda$ threshold, but below the $\Xi^0n$ breakup threshold (2254
MeV), then because the direct, strong interaction decay to the $\Lambda
\Lambda$ channel is forbidden, these flavor-nonsinglet states might be more
amenable to experimental observation. The present results allow a possible
reconciliation between the reported observation of $\Lambda \Lambda$
hypernuclei, which argue against a stable $H_0$, and the possible existence of
$H$ dibaryons in general.
