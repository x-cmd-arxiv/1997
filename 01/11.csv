absorption lines of column densities $\nha \la 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ are produced
in transient, mini pancakes. Such pancakes are modeled here, approximating the
initial perturbation leading to the formation of the pancake as a single
sinusoidal wave. The density and temperature profiles of the gas in the pancake
are determined for $z_c \sim 3$, where $z_c$ is the collapse redshift. The
$\lyal$ absorption line profiles for a line of sight through the pancake are
then calculated. The absorption lines in general have wings signifying bulk
motions in the gas. It is shown that the deviation from a single Voigt profile
is large for small H I column density lines, in which the effect of bulk
motions is large. For lines with $\nha > 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, high temperature
tend to wash out the signatures of bulk motion. The analytical modeling of mini
pancakes associated with $\lyal$ forest lines --- with $10^{13} \la \nha \la
10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$---gives the corresponding mass scales. It is shown here
that, for typical values of cosmological parameters, absorption lines with
$\nha \sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ correspond to structures with baryonic mass of
$M_b \sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ with an overdensity of $\sim 10$ at $z \sim 3$.
The value of $\nha$ can change by a factor $\sim 3$ in the course of evolution
of the pancake in time. It is also shown that there is an upper limit to $\nha$
from a pancake due to the slow recombination rate and the importance of
collisional ionization at high temperatures. Mini pancakes do not give rise to
$\lyal$ lines with $\nha \ga 10^{14.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, for $\j21=1$ and
$\Omega_{IGM} \sim 0.03$.

correctly the edge effects. Analytical results are obtained by perturbation
theory in the limit $\sigma_{xx} \gg 1$. For mesoscopic systems the conduction
process is dominated by diffusion but we show that, due to the lack of
time-reversal symmetry, the boundary condition for diffusion is altered at the
reflecting edges. Instead of the usual condition, that the derivative along the
direction normal to the wall of the diffusing variable vanishes, the derivative
at the Hall angle to the normal vanishes. We demonstrate the origin of this
boundary condition from different starting points, using (i) a simplified
Chalker-Coddington network model, (ii) the standard diagrammatic perturbation
expansion, and (iii) the nonlinear sigma-model with the topological term, thus
establishing connections between the different approaches. Further boundary
effects are found in quantum interference phenomena. We evaluate the mean
bilocal conductivity tensor $\sigma_{\mu\nu}(r,r')$, and the mean and variance
of the conductance, to leading order in $1/\sigma_{xx}$ and to order
$(\sigma_{xy}/\sigma_{xx})^2$, and find that the variance of the conductance
increases with the Hall ratio. Thus the conductance fluctuations are no longer
simply described by the unitary universality class of the $\sigma_{xy}=0$ case,
but instead there is a one-parameter family of probability distributions. In
the quasi-one-dimensional limit, the usual universal result for the conductance
fluctuations of the unitary ensemble is recovered, in contrast to results of
previous authors. Also, a long discussion of current conservation.

$ F_q[SL(n+1)] $, along with a presentation by generators and relations, and
prove that for $ q=1 $ they specialize to $ U({\mathfrak{h}}) $, where $
{\mathfrak{h}} $ is the Lie bialgebra of the Poisson Lie group $ H $ dual of $
SL(n+1) $; moreover, we explain the relation with [loc. cit.]. In sight of
this, we prove two PBW-like theorems for $ F_q[SL(n+1)] $, both related to the
classical PBW theorem for $ U({\mathfrak{h}}) $.

Existence of the homeomorphism of the ring of integer 2-adic numbers to the set

the 2-adic topology on the set of coherent states.

iterating the Darboux transformation, a supersymmetric extension of the Crum
transformation is obtained for the Manin-Radul SKdV equation, in doing so one
gets Wronskian superdeterminant representations for the solutions. Particular
examples provide us explicit supersymmetric extensions, super solitons, of the
standard soliton of the KdV equation. The KdV soliton appears as the body of
the super soliton.

solutions in integrable hierarchies, is the existence of ``vacuum solutions''
corresponding to Lax operators lying in some abelian subalgebra of the
associated affine Kac-Moody algebra. Using the dressing transformation we
construct the solutions in the orbit of those vacuum solutions, and conjecture
that the solitons correspond to some special points in those orbits. The
generalized tau-function for those hierarchies are defined for integrable
highest weight representations. It applies for any level of the representation.
We illustrate our methods with the recently proposed non abelian Toda models
coupled to matter fields. A very special class of such theories possess a U(1)
Noether charge that is proportional to a topological charge. That leads to a
mechanism that confines the matter fields inside the solitons.
