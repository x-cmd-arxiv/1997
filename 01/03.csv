  IV. Realistic Systems","15 pages, 15 postscript figures. To appear in A&A (1997)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This paper is the fourth one of a series whose chief objective is studying
the influence of different mass spectra on the dynamical evolution of open star
clusters. Results from several N-body calculations with primordial binaries and
mass loss due to stellar evolution are presented. The models show significant
differences with those for primordial binaries but no stellar mass loss
presented in de la Fuente Marcos (1996b). A differential dynamical behaviour
depending on cluster richness is found compared to de la Fuente Marcos (1996a).
The evolution of these realistic models is very dependent on the initial mass
function. Even for rich clusters, there is a dependence on the binary mass
spectrum. The velocity distribution of the escapers is examined and compared
with results from previous calculations. The evolution of the primordial binary
population is analyzed in detail. The cluster remnant and the final binary
population are also studied. Finally, some conclusions about observational
properties of Open Cluster Remnants are presented.

rule-based and statistical methods are combined to achieve robust and efficient

that rules are desirable in order to encode domain-independent linguistic

statistics are needed if systems are to be efficient and robust; further, that
hybrid architectures are superior from the point of view of portability to
architectures which only make use of one type of information. We address the
topics of ``multi-engine'' strategies for robust translation; robust bottom-up
parsing using pruning and grammar specialization; rational development of
linguistic rule-sets using balanced domain corpora; and efficient supervised
training by interactive disambiguation. All work described is fully implemented

configurations that a two-dimensional foam can attain. In the first place, the
three centers of the films that converge to a vertex have to be on a line, i.e.
all vertices are aligned. Moreover an equilibrated foam must admit a reciprocal
figure. This means that it must be possible to find a set of points P_i on the
plane, one per bubble, such that the segments (P_i P_j) are normal to the
corresponding foam films. It is furthermore shown that these constraints are
equivalent to the requirement that the foam be a Sectional Multiplicative
Voronoi Partition (SMVP). A SMVP is a cut with a two-dimensional plane, of a
three-dimensional Multiplicative Voronoi Partition. Thus given an arbitrary
equilibrated foam, we can always find point-like sources (one per bubble) in
three dimensions that reproduce this foam as a generalized Voronoi partition.
These sources are the only degrees of freedom that we need in oder to fully
describe the foam.

event rates refer to a number of representative nuclear targets throughout the
periodic table and have been obtained in a relatively wide phenomenologically
allowed SUSY parameter space. For the coherent cross sections it is shown that,
since the momentum transfer can be quite big for large mass of the LSP and
heavy nuclei even though the energy transfer is small ($\le 100 KeV$), the
total cross section can in such instances be reduced by a factor of about five.
For the spin induced cross section of odd-A nuclear targets, as is the case of
$^{207}Pb$ studied in this work, we found that the reduction is less
pronounced, since the high multipoles tend to enhance the cross section as the
momentum transfer increases (for LSP $mass < 200 GeV$) and partially cancell
the momentum retardation. The effect of the Earth's revolution around the sun
on these event rates is also studied by folding with a Maxwellian LSP-velocity
distribution which is consistent with its density in the halos. We thus found
that the convoluted event rates do not appreciably change compared to those
obtained with an average velocity. The event rates increase with A and, in the
SUSY parameter space considered, they can reach values up to 140
$y^{-1}Kg^{-1}$ for Pb. The modulation effect, however, was found to be small

superrenormalizable. At large external momentum p (or small mass M) and large
order N one might expect perturbative bare skeleton graphs to behave roughly
like $N!(ag^2/p)^N$ with a>0, so that no matter how large p is there is an
$N\sim g^2/p$ giving rise to strong perturbative amplitudes. The semi-
classical Lipatov technique (which works only in the presence of a mass) is
blind to this momentum dependence, so we proceed by direct summation of bare

We discuss non-perturbative effects based partly on known physical arguments
concerning the cancellation by solitons of imaginary parts due to the pert-
urbative Borel singularity, and partly on the dressing of bare skeleton graphs
by dressed propagators showing non-perturbative mass generation, as happens in
d=3 gauge theory.

(supercharges) can be defined in a spatially homogeneous physical state, then
this state describes the vacuum. Thus, supersymmetry is broken in any thermal
state and it is impossible to proceed from it by ``symmetrization'' to states
on which an action of supercharges can be defined. So, unlike the familiar
spontaneous breakdown of bosonic symmetries, there is a complete collapse of
supersymmetry in thermal states. It is also shown that spatially homogeneous
superthermal ensembles are never supersymmetric.

circle of length $L$ is studied. The confinement order parameters, such as the
Polyakov loops, are analyzed in both the limits $L \to 0$ and $L \to \infty$.
In the latter limit the behavior of the confinement order parameters is shown
to be described by a 2D non-linear sigma-model on the compact coset space $G/ad
G$, where $G$ is the gauge group and $ad G$ its adjoint action on $G$.
Topological vortex-like excitations of the compact field variable cause a
Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition which is argued to be associated with the
confinement phase transition in the 3D gluodynamics.

arbitrary Lie group as eigenstates of elements of the corresponding complex Lie
algebra. We show that this concept unifies different definitions of coherent
states associated with a dynamical symmetry group. On the one hand, algebra
eigenstates include different sets of Perelomov's generalized coherent states.
On the other hand, intelligent states (which are squeezed states for a system
of general symmetry) also form a subset of algebra eigenstates. We develop the
general formalism and apply it to the SU(2) and SU(1,1) simple Lie groups.
Complete solutions to the general eigenvalue problem are found in the both
cases, by a method that employs analytic representations of the algebra
eigenstates. This analytic method also enables us to obtain exact closed
expressions for quantum statistical properties of an arbitrary algebra
eigenstate. Important special cases such as standard coherent states and
intelligent states are examined and relations between them are studied by using
their analytic representations.

that almost perfect squeezing is obtained for arbitrarily large intra-cavity
photon numbers. Possible experimental implementations are finally discussed.
