study the evolution of a cosmic string network (and the corresponding loop
population) in open universes. It is shown that in this case there is no linear
scaling regime and that even though curvature still dominates the dynamics, at
late times strings become the main component of the universe. We also comment
on the possible consequences of these results.

weaker than the bound derived earlier by Borisov and Grishina using the same

the more stringent bound $g_{ae}\lsim 9x10^{-13} (T/10^7 K)^{5/4} (B/10^{10}

cold dark matter (CDM) in the Universe is proposed and corresponding scenarios
are outlined. Possible realizations of the idea in the framework of
supersymmetric models are considered and constraints (predictions) on masses of
sparticles compatible with the viability of the scenario are derived. Mulitiple
predictions might be extracted from the concept. In particular, we predict a
quite natural existence of a charge asymmetric component of CDM. A $\sim
10^{-2}$ part of CDM might exist in the form of electrically charged relic
particles with masses $m \simeq 1$ TeV. They are negatively charged and are
dresses by protons. This conjecture provides a rich field of immediate search
for these particles. The charge symmetric component of CDM might be represented
by very light, $m \approx 2$ GeV, very weakly interacting particles like
right-handed sneutrinos ( so recoils expected are rare and have quite small
energies, $E_{recoil} \sim 1$ KeV.) This leads by the way to prediction of
long-living (charged) sparticles. Some new experimental proposals for
non-traditional search of cold dark matter particles are mentioned.

techniques we calculate string tensions between charges and find the number of

agreement with the standard classification based on the topology of the
effective gauge group $\pi_1(G/Z)$ when one considers arbitrary numbers of
adjoint charges in the system. For systems with limited numbers of charges we
find additional ""meta-stable"" vacuum states. Finally we discuss t'Hooft's
disorder operators in this setting as number operators for the multiple vacua.

superconductor, the individual flux tubes with unit color flux are stable. On
