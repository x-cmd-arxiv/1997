simulations. The algorithm employs a traditional particle-mesh technique on a
cubic grid and successive multilevel relaxations on the finer meshes,
introduced recursively in a fully adaptive manner in the regions where the
density exceeds a predefined threshold. The mesh is generated to effectively
match an arbitrary geometry of the underlying density field -- a property
particularly important for cosmological simulations. In a simulation the mesh
structure is not created at every time step but is properly adjusted to the
evolving particle distribution. The algorithm is fast and effectively parallel.
We present a detailed description of the methodology, implementation, and tests
of the code.
  We further use the code to study the structure of dark matter halos in
high-resolution (2/h kpc) simulations of standard CDM (Omega=1, h=0.5,
sigma_8=0.63) and LCDM (Omega_Lambda=1-Omega_0=0.7, h=0.7, sigma_8=1.0) models.
We find that halo density profiles in both CDM and LCDM models are well fitted
by the analytical model presented recently by Navarro et al., which predicts a
singular [$\rho(r)\propto r^{-1}$] behavior of the halo density profiles at
small radii. We therefore conclude that halos formed in the $\Lambda$CDM model
have structure similar to CDM halos and thus cannot explain the dynamics of the
central parts of dwarf spiral galaxies, as inferred from the galaxies' rotation
curves.

mass, namely, the dynamical masses obtained from the velocity dispersion of
optical galaxies, the X-ray masses measured from the temperature of X-ray
emitting gas under the assumption of isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium, and
the gravitational lensing masses derived from the strong/weak distortions of
background galaxy images. Using a sample of 29 lensing clusters available in
literature, we have shown that the dynamical masses are in agreement with the
gravitational lensing masses, while the X-ray method has systematically
underestimated cluster masses by a factor 2-3 as compared with the others.
These results imply that galaxies indeed trace the gravitational potential of
their clusters, and there is no bias between the velocities of the dark matter
particles and the galaxies in clusters. The X-ray cluster mass discrepancy is
probably from the simplification in the models for the X-ray gas distribution
and dynamical evolution.

  A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1212",,"quant-ph",,"  How well one can copy an arbitrary qubit? To answer this question we consider
two arbitrary vectors in a two-dimensional state space and an abstract copying
transformation which will copy these two vectors. If the vectors are
orthogonal, then perfect copies can be made. If they are not, then errors will
be introduced. The size of the error depends on the inner product of the two
original vectors. We derive a lower bound for the amount of noise induced by
quantum copying. We examine both copying transformations which produce one copy
and transformations which produce many, and show that the quality of each copy
decreases as the number of copies increases.

systematically to describe and gain new information about
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy and its reductions. Interrelation to the
tau-function method is discussed in detail. The principal result, which forms
the basis of our SEP method, is the proof that any eigenfunction of the general
KP hierarchy can be represented as a spectral integral over the Baker-Akhiezer
(BA) wave function with a spectral density expressed in terms of SEP. In fact,
the spectral representations of the (adjoint) BA functions can, in turn, be
considered as defining equations for the KP hierarchy. The SEP method is
subsequently used to show how the reduction of the full KP hierarchy to the
constrained KP hierarchies can be given entirely in terms of linear constraint
equations on the pertinent tau-functions. The concept of SEP turns out to be
crucial in providing a description of constrained KP hierarchies in the
language of universal Sato Grassmannian and finding the non-isospectral
Virasoro symmetry generators acting on the underlying tau-functions. The SEP
method is used to write down generalized binary Darboux-Backlund
transformations for constrained KP hierarchies whose orbits are shown to
correspond to a new Toda model on a square lattice. As a result, we obtain a
series of new determinant solutions for the tau-functions generalizing the
known Wronskian (multi-soliton) solutions. Finally, applications to random
matrix models in condensed matter physics are briefly discussed.
