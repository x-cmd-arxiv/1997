with an empirical mass - (absolute magnitude) relation that best fits the
observed data. At a given mass below 0.6M_sun the effective temperatures differ
substantially from model to model. However taken individually each set of
models is in good agreement with observations in the mass - luminosity plane. A
minimum in the derivative dm/dM_V at M_V = 11.5, which is due to H_2 formation
and establishment of a fully convective stellar interior, is present in all
photometric bands, for all models. This minimum leads to a maximum in the
stellar luminosity function for Galactic disk stars at M_V = 11.5, M_bol = 9.8.
Stellar models should locate this maximum in the stellar luminosity function at
the same magnitude as observations. Models which incorporate the most realistic
theoretical atmospheres and the most recent equation of state and opacities can
satisfy this constraint. These models are also in best agreement with the most
recent luminosity - (effective temperature) and mass-luminosity data. Each set
of our models of a given metallicity (with 0.2 > [Fe/H] > -2.3) shows a maximum
in -dm/dM_bol, which moves to brighter bolometric magnitudes with decreasing
metallicity. The change in location of the maximum, as a function of [Fe/H],
follows the location of structure in luminosity functions for stellar
populations with different metal abundances. This structure seen in all
observed stellar populations can be accounted for by the mass--luminosity
relation.

of the black-hole entropy. To judge whether this speculation is true or not, it
is effective to investigate the whole structure of thermodynamics obtained from
the entanglement entropy, rather than just to examine the apparent structure of
the entropy alone or to compare it with that of the black hole entropy. It is
because entropy acquires a physical significance only when it is related to the
energy and the temperature of a system. From this point of view, we construct a
`thermodynamics of entanglement' by introducing an entanglement energy and
compare it with the black-hole thermodynamics. We consider two possible
definitions of entanglement energy. Then we construct two different kinds of
thermodynamics by combining each of these different definitions of entanglement
energy with the entanglement entropy. We find that both of these two kinds of
thermodynamics show significant differences from the black-hole thermodynamics
if no gravitational effects are taken into account. These differences are in
particular highlighted in the context of the third law of thermodynamics.
Finally we see how inclusion of gravity alter the thermodynamics of the
entanglement. We give a suggestive argument that the thermodynamics of the
entanglement behaves like the black-hole thermodynamics if the gravitational
effects are included properly. Thus the entanglement entropy passes a
non-trivial check to be the origin of the black-hole entropy.

expansion in the case of $\pi\pi$ scattering and the pion form factors. The
analysis is mainly restricted to the elastic approximation but the possible
extension to the inelastic case is also discussed in some detail. It is shown
how the two-loop approach improves the inverse amplitude method applied to
one-loop order in the chiral expansion. For both $\pi\pi$ scattering and the
pion form factors, it is in fact found that the inverse amplitude method to
two-loop order agrees remarkable well with the experimental data up to energies
where inelasticities become essential. At somewhat lower energies, the two-loop
approach compares well with the one-loop approximation, and in the threshold
region they both agree with chiral perturbation theory. This suggests that the
inverse amplitude method is indeed a rather systematic way of improving chiral
perturbation theory order by order in the chiral expansion.

following effective bound emerges for mu<0 at the 2 sigma level: tan(beta)~<
0.43 (M_H^\pm/GeV). Remarkably, for mu>0 there could be no bound at all.
Finally, we provide a combined (tan(beta,M_H^\pm) exclusion plot using our

violation (topological transitions) in the hot, symmetric phase of electroweak
theory is of the form $\eta \alpha_w^5 T^4$ in the weak-coupling limit, where
$\eta$ is a non-perturbative numerical coefficient. Over the past several
years, there have been attempts to extract the rate of baryon number violation
from real-time simulations of classical thermal field theory on a spatial
lattice. Unfortunately, the coefficient $\eta$ will not be the same for
classical lattice theories and the real quantum theory. However, by analyzing
the appropriate effective theory on the lattice using the method of hard
thermal loops, I show that the only obstruction to precisely relating the rates
in the real and lattice theories is the fact that the long-distance physics on
the lattice is not rotationally invariant. (This is unlike Euclidean-time
measurements, where rotational invariance is always recovered in the continuum
limit.) I then propose how this violation of rotational invariance can be
eliminated - and the real B violation rate measured - by choosing an
appropriate lattice Hamiltonian. I also propose a rough measure of the
systematic error to be expected from using simpler, unimproved Hamiltonians. As
a byproduct of my investigation, the plasma frequency and Debye mass are
computed for classical thermal field theory on the lattice.

Horwitz, et. al., certain difficulties persist in the associated covariant
classical mechanics. In this paper, we explore these difficulties through an
examination of the classical Coulomb problem in the framework of off-shell
electrodynamics. As the local gauge theory of a covariant quantum mechanics
with evolution parameter $\tau$, off-shell electrodynamics constitutes a
dynamical theory of spacetime events, interacting through five $\tau$-dependent
pre-Maxwell potentials. We present a straightforward solution of the classical
equations of motion, which is seen to be unsatisfactory, and reveals the
essential difficulties in the formalism at the classical level. We then offer a
new model of the particle current -- as a certain distribution of the event
currents on the worldline -- which eliminates these difficulties and permits
comparison of classical off-shell electrodynamics with the standard Maxwell
theory. In this model, the ``fixed'' event induces a Yukawa-type potential,
permitting a semi-classical identification of the pre-Maxwell time scale
$\lambda$ with the inverse mass of the intervening photon. Numerical solutions
to the equations of motion are compared with the standard Maxwell solutions,
and are seen to coincide when $\lambda \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ seconds, providing an
initial estimate of this parameter. It is also demonstrated that the proposed
model provides a natural interpretation for the photon mass cut-off required
for the renormalizability of the off-shell quantum electrodynamics.

arbitrary functions of J_0 and generalizing the Witten algebra, were introduced
some time ago by Delbecq and Quesne. In the present paper, the problem of
endowing some of them with a Hopf algebraic structure is addressed by studying
in detail a specific example, referred to as ${\cal A}^+_q(1)$. This algebra is
shown to possess two series of (N+1)-dimensional unitary irreducible
representations, where N=0, 1, 2, .... To allow the coupling of any two such
representations, a generalization of the standard Hopf axioms is proposed by
proceeding in two steps. In the first one, a variant and extension of the
deforming functional technique is introduced: variant because a map between two
deformed algebras, su_q(2) and ${\cal A}^+_q(1)$, is considered instead of a
map between a Lie algebra and a deformed one, and extension because use is made
of a two-valued functional, whose inverse is singular. As a result, the Hopf
structure of su_q(2) is carried over to ${\cal A}^+_q(1)$, thereby endowing the
latter with a double Hopf structure. In the second step, the definition of the
coproduct, counit, antipode, and R-matrix is extended so that the double Hopf
algebra is enlarged into a new algebraic structure. The latter is referred to
as a two-colour quasitriangular Hopf algebra because the corresponding R-matrix
is a solution of the coloured Yang-Baxter equation, where the `colour'
parameters take two discrete values associated with the two series of
finite-dimensional representations.

linear as for su(2), the latter give rise to exponential spectra, a property
that has aroused much interest in connection with some physical problems.
