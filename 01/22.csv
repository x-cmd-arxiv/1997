towards the Local Group. This non-detection is in marginal conflict with
previous Tully-Fisher studies. Two clusters in the background of the
supercluster exhibit significant negative peculiar velocities, characteristic
of backside infall into PP. A bulk-flow fit to all 16 clusters reveals a
statistically insignificant motion of 430 +/- 280 km/s towards l=265, b=26 (CMB

an estimate for the fraction of all HB stars that must be contributing to the
UV upturn phenomenon in the strongest UVX galaxy, NGC 1399, and derive a hot
star fraction f_H ~ 0.16.The implication is that UVX arises from a minority

velocity perturbations in the HI velocity field that should result from the
spiral structure observed in the R band images. The weak observed response in
the $\phi$ velocity component limits the mass-to-light ratios of the disk
within a scale length to M/L <~ 3 and 6 for UGC 6614 for F568-6 respectively
(in solar units) based upon azimuthal variations observed in the R band images.
These limits are sufficiently strong to require a significant dark matter
component even in the central regions of these galaxies. Our limits furthermore
imply that this dark matter component cannot be in the form of a cold disk
since a cold disk would necessarily be involved in the spiral structure.
However, a more massive disk could be consistent with the observations because
of a non-linear gas response or if the gas is driven by bar-like distortions
instead of spiral structure. To produce the large observed arm/interarm HI
density variations it is likely that the spiral arm potential perturbation is
sufficiently strong to produce shocks in the gas. For a forcing that is greater
than 2% of the axisymmetric force, M/L >~ 1 is required in both galaxies in the
outer regions. These lower limits imply that the stellar surface density is at
least of the same order as the gas surface density. This is consistent with the
large scale morphology of the spiral structure, and the stability of the gas
disk, both which suggest that a moderate stellar component is required to
produce the observed spiral structure. (Shortened abstract)

the metagalactic ionizing background and on the ``local effects'' of hot stars

backgrounds plus a decrement at 4 Ryd to account for He II attenuation in

on cosmological radiative transfer models produce more complex ionizing spectra
between 1-5 Ryd that are critical to interpreting ions of Si and C. We also
make a preliminary investigation of the effects of He II ionization front
non-overlap. Because the attenuation and re-emission by intervening clouds
enhance Si IV relative to C IV, the observed high Si IV/C IV ratios do not
require an unrealistic Si overproduction [Si/C $\geq 3 (Si/C)_{\odot}$]. If the
ionizing spectrum is dominated by ``local effects'' from massive stars, even
larger Si IV/C IV ratios are possible. However, unless stellar radiation
dominates quasars by more than a factor of 10, we confirm the evidence for some
Si overproduction by massive stars; values Si/C $\approx 2 (Si/C)_{\odot}$ fit
the measurements better than solar abundances. Ultimately, an adequate

preserved during gravitational evolution and galaxy formation. In this paper we
study the total number density of peaks in a (galaxy) point distribution
smoothed with a filter, evaluating its usefulness as a means of inferring the
shape of the initial (matter) power spectrum. We find that in numerical
simulations which start from Gaussian initial conditions, the peak density
follows well that predicted by the theory of Gaussian density fields, even on
scales where the clustering is mildly non-linear. For smaller filter scales, $r
\simlt 4-6 \hmpc$, we see evidence of merging as the peak density decreases
with time. On larger scales, the peak density is independent of time. One might
also expect it to be fairly robust with respect to variations in biasing, i.e.
the way galaxies trace mass fluctuations. We find that this is the case when we
apply various biasing prescriptions to the matter distribution in simulations.
If the initial conditions are Gaussian, it is possible to use the peak density
measured from the evolved field to reconstruct the shape of the initial power
spectrum. We describe a stable method for doing this and apply it to several
biased and unbiased non-linear simulations. We are able to recover the slope of
the linear matter power spectrum on scales $k \simlt 0.4 \hmpc^{-1}$. The
reconstruction has the advantage of being independent of the cosmological
parameters ($\Omega$, $\Lambda$, $H_0$) and of the clustering normalisation
($\sigma_8$). The peak density and reconstructed power spectrum slope therefore
promise to be powerful discriminators between popular cosmological scenarios.

proposed neural network has richer and more flexible dynamics, so that it can
be expected to have higher ability of searching for globally optimal or
near-optimal solutions. A significant property of this model is that the
chaotic neurodynamics is temporarily generated for searching and
self-organizing, and eventually vanishes with autonomous decreasing of a
bifurcation parameter corresponding to the ""temperature"" in usual annealing
process. Therefore, the neural network gradually approaches, through the
transient chaos, to dynamical structure similar to such conventional models as
the Hopfield neural network which converges to a stable equilibrium point.
Since the optimization process of the transiently chaotic neural network is
similar to simulated annealing, not in a stochastic way but in a
deterministically chaotic way, the new method is regarded as chaotic simulated
annealing (CSA). Fundamental characteristics of the transiently chaotic
neurodynamics are numerically investigated with examples of a single neuron
model and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Moreover, a maintenance
scheduling problem for generators in a practical power system is also analysed

punctuated equilibria reflects the tendency of dynamical systems to evolve
towards a critical state, and review recent work on simple models. A good
metaphoric picture is one where the systems are temporarily trapped in valleys
of deformable, interacting landscapes. Similarities with spin glasses are

opening transitions from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to the Mott insulator

strength. Finite interaction range is crucial to have the Mott transition at a
rational filling away from the half filling. It is consistent with the strong
coupling picture where the Mott gap exists at any rational fillings with
sufficiently strong interaction. The critical regions as a quantum phase
transition are also investigated numerically. Non-analytic behavior of the Mott
gap is the characteristic in the weak coupling. It is of the order of the

at zero temperature. Fractal nature of the ground state phase diagram is also

  approach","21 pages, Latex, uses amssymb.sty",,,"THEP 97/3","hep-th",,"  It is known that in the WKB approximation of multicomponent systems like
Dirac equation or Born-Oppenheimer approximation, an additional phase appears
apart from the Berry phase. So far, this phase was only examined in special
cases, or under certain restrictive assumptions, namely that the eigenspaces of
the matrix or endomorphism valued symbol of the Hamiltonian form trivial
bundles.
  We give a completely global derivation of this phase which does not depend on
any choice of local trivializing sections. This is achieved using a star
product approach to quantization. Furthermore, we give a systematic and global
approach to a reduction of the problem to a problem defined completely on the
different ``polarizations''. Finally, we discuss to what extent it is actually
possible to reduce the problem to a really scalar one, and make some comments
on obstructions to the existence of global quasiclassical states.

  presentation of the algebraic constraint quantization scheme",,,"THEP 96/17","hep-th",,"  The pseudo--rigid body represents an example of a constrained system with a
nonunimodular gauge group. This system is treated along the guidelines of an
algebraic constraint quantization scheme which focusses on observable
quantities, translating the vanishing of the constraints into representation
conditions on the algebra of observables. The constraint which is responsible
for the nonunimodularity of the gauge group is shown not to contribute to the
observable content of the constraints, i.e., not to impose any restrictions on
the construction of the quantum theory of the system. The application of the
algebraic constraint quantization scheme yields a unique quantization of the
physical degrees of freedom, which are shown to form a realization of the
so-called CM(N) model of collective motions.

as part of the requirements for ``Habilitation'' at the university of Bern: At
a pressure of 220 atm. and a temperature of 374 Celsius there is a second-order
phase transition between water and steam. Understanding it requires the concept
of the renormalization group. Images from computer simulations of the lattice
gas model (included) are used to explain its basic ideas. It is briefly
reviewed how the renormalization group is used to compute critical coefficients
for the water-steam phase transition, in good agreement with experiment.
Applications in particle physics and string theory are mentioned. The appendix
contains a sample of the author's results on renormalization group flows in
theories with dynamical gravity and their relation to perturbative string
theory: gravity modifies critical coefficients and phase diagrams, in agreement
with numerical calculations, and leads to curious phenomena such as oscillating
flows and quantum mechanical flows.

  Lie groups",,,,"Banach Archive 1/22/97","math.FA",,"  For a (compact) subset $K$ of a metric space and $\varepsilon > 0$, the {\em
covering number} $N(K , \varepsilon )$ is defined as the smallest number of
balls of radius $\varepsilon$ whose union covers $K$. Knowledge of the {\em
metric entropy}, i.e., the asymptotic behaviour of covering numbers for
(families of) metric spaces is important in many areas of mathematics
(geometry, functional analysis, probability, coding theory, to name a few). In
this paper we give asymptotically correct estimates for covering numbers for a
large class of homogeneous spaces of unitary (or orthogonal) groups with
respect to some natural metrics, most notably the one induced by the operator
norm. This generalizes earlier author's results concerning covering numbers of
Grassmann manifolds; the generalization is motivated by applications to
noncommutative probability and operator algebras. In the process we give a
characterization of geodesics in $U(n)$ (or $SO(m)$) for a class of
non-Riemannian metric structures.

rapidly rotating nuclei with internal excitation energy up to a few MeV, use is
made of a shell model which combines the cranked Nilsson mean-field and the
residual surface delta two-body force. The damping of collective rotational
motion is investigated in the case of a typical rare-earth nucleus, namely \Yb.
It is found that rotational damping sets in at around 0.8 MeV above the yrast
line, and the levels which form rotational band structures are thus limited. We
predict at a given rotational frequency existence of about 30 rotational bands
of various lengths, in overall agreement with the experimental findings. The
onset of the rotational damping proceeds quite gradually as a function of the
internal excitation energy. The transition region extends up to around 2 MeV
above yrast and it is characterized by the presence of scars of discrete
rotational bands which extend over few spin values and stand out among the
damped transitions, and by a two-component profile in the $E_\gamma -E_\gamma$
correlation. The important role played by the high-multipole components of the
two-body residual interaction is emphasized.
