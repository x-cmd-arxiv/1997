to z=2 within the framework of a cosmological model for the Lyman alpha forest,
comparing the results of numerical simulations to recent observations by
Songaila & Cowie (1996, SC). In agreement with Rauch, Haehnelt & Steinmetz
(1996), we find that the observed mean value of the CIV/HI ratio around z=3 is
reproduced if a uniform metallicity of [C/H] = -2.5 is assumed in our model,
but that the observed scatter in this ratio is larger than predicted, implying
a scatter in the metallicity of the absorbing systems of roughly an order of
magnitude. We further argue that absorbers with relatively low column densities
(log(N_HI) < 15) likely have a mean metallicity [C/H] less than -2.5, a result
which is basically independent of the model considered, and similar to what is
predicted in the simulations by Gnedin & Ostriker (1997). Our model predicts no
significant evolution in the mean values of metal line column densities between
z=3.5 and z=2. Comparison of the predicted and observed numbers of SiIV and NV
systems suggests that the photoionizing background radiation field around z=3
is somewhat softer than that proposed by Haardt & Madau (1996). Our model does
not account for the increase in the SiIV/CIV ratio at z=3.2 found by SC. While
SC suggested that the increase could be explained by a softening of the
radiation field due to HeII absorption at z > 3, such a modification does not
raise the mean value of SiIV/CIV in our simulation because it shifts numerous
weak SiIV systems to just above the detection limit, thus keeping the mean
column density of observable SiIV systems low.

scaling law for the cooling front speed. Here we derive a similarity solution
for the hot inner part of disks undergoing cooling. This solution is exact in
the limit of a thin disk, power law opacities, and a minimum hot state column
density which is an infinitesimal fraction of the maximum cold state density.
For a disk of finite thickness the largest error is in the ratio of the mass
flow across the cooling front to the mass flow at small radii. Comparison to
the numerical simulations of Cannizzo et al. (1995) inidcates that the errors
in the other parameters do not exceed $(c_{sF}/r_F\Omega_F)^q$, that is, the
ratio of the sound speed at the disk midplane to its orbital velocity,
evaluated at the cooling front, to the qth power. Here $q\approx 1/2$. Its
precise value is determined by the relevant hot state opacity law and the

-18.34, and phi* = 0.0036, assuming H_0 = 100. We compare these results to

of the observation selection bias imposed by surface brightness are missing a
substantial fraction of the galaxies in the local universe. Under our most
conservative estimates, our derivation of the LF for LSB galaxies suggests that
the CfA redshift survey has missed at least one third of the local galaxy
population. This overlooked fraction is not enough by itself to explain the
large number of faint blue galaxies observed at moderate redshift under
no-evolution models, but it does help close the gap between local and
moderate-redshift galaxy counts.

presence of both the nonlinear and the random terms, and can be though of as an
ordering of the stochastic energy input by the combined effect of nonlinearity
and topography. The statistically steady state is well described by a
generalized canonical equilibrium with mean energy and enstrophy determined by
a balance between random forcing and dissipation. This result allows predicting
the strengh of the noise-sustained currents. Finally we discuss the relevance

potentially lead to novel behaviour. We thus investigate the asymptotic
properties of the following two `mixed noise' reaction-diffusion systems. The
first is a combination of the annihilation and scattering processes 2A->0,
2A->2B, 2B->2A, and 2B->0. We demonstrate (to all orders in perturbation

annihilation and fission processes, 2A->0 and 2A->(n+2)A, a model which
exhibits a transition between active and absorbing phases. However, this
transition and the active phase are not accessible to perturbative methods, as
the field theory describing these reactions is shown to be non-renormalisable.
This corresponds to the fact that there is no stationary state in the active
phase, where the particle density diverges at finite times. We discuss the

\alpha x^{\alpha-1}$, $x\leq l$ . We explicitly obtain the scaling function in
the case of random sequential adsorption (RSA) and show that the pattern
created in the long time limit becomes scale invariant. This pattern can be
described by an unique exponent, the fractal dimension. In addition, we
introduce an external tuning parameter beta to describe the correlated
sequential deposition of a mixture of particles where the degree of correlation
is determined by beta, while beta=0 corresponds to random sequential deposition
of mixture. We show that the fractal dimension of the resulting pattern
increases as beta increases and reaches a constant non-zero value in the limit
$\beta \to \infty$ when the pattern becomes perfectly ordered or non-random
fractals.

four-legged graph that consists of a string of bubbles. This regularity is a
necessary ingredient in the proof that renormalization does not change the

of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous dust. Such a collapse is described by
the Tolman-Bondi-Lema{\^i}tre metric, which is a two-parameter family of
solutions to Einstein equations, characterized by two free functions of the
radial coordinate, namely the `mass function' F(r) and the `energy function'
f(r). The main new result here relates, in a general way, the formation of
black holes and naked shell-focusing singularities resulting as the final fate
of such a collapse to the generic form of regular initial data. Such a data is
characterized in terms of the density and velocity profiles of the matter,
specified on an initial time slice from which the collapse commences. Several
issues regarding the strength and stability of these singularities, when they
are naked, are examined with the help of the analysis developed here. In
particular, it is seen that strong curvature naked singularities can develop
from a generic form of initial data in terms of the initial density profiles
for the collapsing configuration. We also establish here that similar results
hold for black hole formation as well. We also discuss here the physical
constraints on the initial data for avoiding shell-crossing singularities; and
also the shell-focusing naked singularities, so that the collapse will
necessarily end as a black hole, preserving the cosmic censorship. These
results generalize several earlier works on inhomogeneous dust collapse as
special cases, and provide a clearer insight into the phenomena of black hole
and naked singularity formation in gravitational collapse.

considered. It is shown that standard construction of both first order phase
transitions, H-Q as well as Q-QGP implies a discontinuous structure of entropy
per baryon S/N_B when crossing phase boundary; this results in impossibility of
equilibrium transition from QGP to hadron gas.
  We follow the way suggested recently by H. Satz et al. for the same problem
concerning direct transition H-QGP. They proposed a modification of bag
pressure parameter B_{QGP} by making it dependent on system temperature T and
baryon chemical potential mu; this modification has been demonstrated to be
sufficient to provide S/N_B conservation.
  Here we show that within DPTM such a modification turns out to be necessary
and sufficient for bag pressure B_Q in the Q phase only. The DPTM modified in
such a way is shown to satisfy equilibrium Gibbs criteria for phase
transitions. Location of phase boundaries in $\mu -T$ plane has been
demonstrated to be changed but slightly; the modification tells mainly on
baryon number density within Q phase. Two alternative descriptions of

worldvolume chiral field in a background of gravitational and antisymmetric
gauge fields of D=11 supergravity. When the five-brane couples to a three-rank
antisymmetric gauge field local worldvolume symmetries of the five-brane
require the addition to the action of an appropriate Wess-Zumino term. To
preserve general coordinate and Lorentz invariance of the model we introduce a
single auxiliary scalar field. The auxiliary field can be eliminated by gauge
fixing a corresponding local symmetry at the price of the loss of manifest d=6
worldvolume covariance. The double dimensional reduction of the five-brane
model results in the Born-Infeld action with the Wess-Zumino term for a D=10
four-D-brane.

configuration with zero binding energy. The rule is derived in a model
independent way and in arbitrary spacetime dimensions $D$ by solving the
equations of motion of gravity coupled to a dilaton and several different
$n$-form field strengths. The intersection rules are all compatible with
supersymmetry, although derived without using it. We then specialize to the
branes occurring in type II string theories and in M-theory. We show that the
intersection rules are consistent with the picture that open branes can have
boundaries on some other branes. In particular, all the D-branes of dimension
$q$, with $1\leq q \leq6$, can have boundaries on the solitonic 5-brane.

oscillators with randomly distributed frequencies is studied for phase
dynamical models with arbitrary coupling; the effect of a stochastic temporal
variation in the frequencies is also included. The Fokker-Planck equation for
the coupled Langevin system is reduced to a kinetic equation for the oscillator
distribution function. Instabilities of the phase-incoherent state are studied
by center manifold reduction to the amplitude dynamics of the unstable modes.
Depending on the coupling, the coefficients in the normal form can be singular
in the limit of weak instability when the diffusive effect of the noise is
neglected. A detailed analysis of these singularities to all orders in the
normal form expansion is presented. Physically, the singularities are
interpreted as predicting an altered scaling of the entrained component near
the onset of synchronization.

by results of Green R(A), the extended Hall-Ringel algebra of A, has a natural
Hopf algebra structure. We consider its Heisenberg double Heis(A) and study its
relation with D(A), the derived category of A. We show that Heis(A) can be
viewed as a ""Hall algebra"" of D^{0,1}(A), the subcategory of complexes situated
in degrees 0 and 1, in the following sense: if B is the heart of a t-structure
on D(A) lying in D^{0,1}(A), then R(B) is naturally a subalgebra in Heis(A).
Further, we define a new algebra L(A) called the lattice algebra of A, obtained
by taking infinitely many copies of R(A), one for each site of an infinite
1-dimensional lattice and imposing Heisenberg double-type relations between
copies at adjacent sites and oscillator-type relations between copies at
non-adjacent sites. This algebra serves as the ""Hall algebra"" of the full
derived category D(A) in the following sense: any derived equivalence
D(A)-->D(B) induces an isomorphism of lattice algebras L(A)-->L(B).

phase - is now a well assessed method for ``measuring'' the quantum state. In
this paper I will show how it can be used as a kind of universal detection, for
measuring generic field operators, however at expense of some additional noise.
The general class of field operators that can be measured in this way is
presented, and includes also operators that are inaccessible to heterodyne
detection. The noise from tomographical homodyning is compared to that from
heterodyning, for those operators that can be measured in both ways. It turns
out that for some operators homodyning is better than heterodyning when the
mean photon number is sufficiently small. Finally, the robustness of the method
to additive phase-insensitive noise is analyzed. It is shown that just half
photon of thermal noise would spoil the measurement completely.

classical probability theory are incompatible with quantum probabilities, and
this is the reason for the violation of Bell's inequalities. Szab\'o showed
that, in fact, these inequalities are not violated by the experimentally
observed frequencies if we consider the real, ``effective'' frequencies. We
prove in this work a theorem which generalizes this result: ``effective''
frequencies associated to quantum events always admit a Kolmogorovian
representation, when these events are collected through different experimental
set ups, the choice of which obeys a classical distribution.
