  prepared for publication",,,,"alg-geom hep-th math.AG math.QA q-alg",,"  By the fundamental result of I.I. Piatetsky-Shapiro and I.R. Shafarevich
(1971), the automorphism group Aut(X) of a K3 surface X over C and its action
on the Picard lattice S_X are prescribed by the Picard lattice S_X. We use this
result and our method (1980) to show finiteness of the set of Picard lattices
S_X of rank $\ge 3$ such that the automorphism group Aut(X) of the K3 surface X
has a non-trivial invariant sublattice S_0 in S_X where the group Aut(X) acts
as a finite group. For hyperbolic and parabolic lattices S_0 it has been proved
by the author before (1980, 1995). Thus we extend this results to negative
sublattices S_0.
  We give several examples of Picard lattices S_X with parabolic and negative
S_0. We also formulate the corresponding finiteness result for reflective
hyperbolic lattices of hyperbolic type over purely real algebraic number
fields.
  These results are important for the theory of Lorentzian Kac--Moody algebras
and Mirror Symmetry.

stronger in giants, does not affect the response of the Wing-Ford band to

the ratio of a half-thickness to radius of the disk). This solution describes a
homologous collapse of a disk via self-gravity and viscosity. The disk
structure and evolution is distinct in the inner and outer parts. There is a
constant mass inflow in the outer portions so that the disk has flat rotation
velocity, constant accretion velocity, and surface density decreasing outward
as $\Sigma \propto r^{-1}$. In the inner portions, in contrast, mass is
accumulated near the center owing to the boundary condition of no radial
velocity at the origin, thereby a strong central concentration being produced;
surface density varies as $\Sigma \propto r^{-5/3}$. Moreover, the transition
radius separating the inner and outer portions increases linearly with time.
The consequence of such a high condensation is briefly discussed in the context
of formation of a quasar black hole.

phase to defect turbulence is interpreted as an ergodicity breaking transition
which occurs when the range of allowed winding numbers vanishes. We explain the
states reached at long times in terms of three basic states, namely
quasiperiodic states, frozen turbulence states, and riding turbulence states.
Justification and some insight into them is obtained from an analysis of a
phase equation for nonzero winding number: rigidly moving solutions of this
equation, which correspond to quasiperiodic and frozen turbulence states, are
understood in terms of periodic and chaotic solutions of an associated system
of ordinary differential equations. A short report of some of our results has

This enhancement appears to attain a maximum at $U/t \sim 3.0$ and the maximum
shifts to larger values when the alternation parameter is increased. The system
shows no tendency to destroy the imposed bond-alternation pattern, as evidenced
by the bond-bond correlations. The cis- distortion is seen to be favoured over

  Memory of Antonio Signorini, Isola d'Elba, June 1991",,,,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  The notions of stress and hyperstress are anchored in 3-dimensional continuum
mechanics. Within the framework of the 4-dimensional spacetime continuum,
stress and hyperstress translate into the energy-momentum and the hypermomentum
current, respectively. These currents describe the inertial properties of
classical matter fields in relativistic field theory. The hypermomentum current
can be split into spin, dilation, and shear current. We discuss the
conservation laws of momentum and hypermomentum and point out under which
conditions the momentum current becomes symmetric.

"hep-lat/9701010","Ajit Fdn.","Vikram Vyas","Random Walk Representation of the Lattice Fermionic Propagators and the
  Quark Model","21 pages, LaTeX",,,,"hep-lat hep-th",,"  A representation of the continuum fermionic propagator as a sum of directed
random walks on a lattice is presented. Also a random walk representation for
the lattice fermionic propagators is developed for the case of the naive, the
Wilson, and the Kogut-Susskind fermions. For the naive fermions the phenomenon
of fermion doubling appears as having $2^{D}$ distinct spin factors being
associated with a single path in $D$-dimensions. In the case of the Wilson and
the Kogut-Susskind fermions, in the naive continuum limit, the path integral
representation coincides with the path integral representation for the
continuum fermionic propagator. Using this representation the Green's functions
of lattice QCD involving quark operators are written as a sum over the paths of
valence quark, the gauge fields and the sea quarks being integrated out.
Possible advantages of such a representation are illustrated by showing how one
can use numerical simulations to obtain a heuristic insight into the
relationship between QCD and the constituent quark model.

of chiral condensates within the ``quench'' scenario of the chiral phase
transition. The dynamics is modeled with a gauged linear sigma model. A novel
quantum kinetic approach to the description of photoproduction far off
equilibrium is developed. We find that non-equilibrium spinodal instabilities
of long wavelength pion fluctuations are responsible for an enhanced
photoproduction rate for energies $\leq 80$ MeV at order $\alpha$. These
non-equilibrium effects lead to a larger contribution than the typical
processes in the medium, including that of the anomalous neutral pion decay
$\pi^0 \rightarrow 2 \gamma$ (which is of order $\alpha^2$). We follow the
evolution of the dynamics throughout the phase transition, which in this
scenario occurs on a time scale of about $2.5-3$ fm/c and integrate the photon
yield through its evolution. The spectrum of photons produced throughout the
phase transition is a non- equilibrium one. For thermal initial conditions at
the time of the quench it interpolates between a thermal distribution about 6%
above the initial temperature (at the time of the quench) for low energy $\leq
80$ MeV photons, and a high energy tail in thermal equilibrium at the initial
temperature, with a smooth crossover at 100 MeV. The rate displays a peak at
$\sim 35$ MeV which receives a larger enhancement the closer the initial
temperature at the time of the quench is to the critical temperature. It is
found that the enhancement of photoproduction at low energies is not an
artifact caused by the initial distribution of the photons, but is due to the
pionic instabilities. We suggest that these strong out of equilibrium effects
may provide experimental signatures for the formation and relaxation of DCC's
in heavy ion collisions.

the non-perturbative effect of the $SU(2)_S$ `supercolor' interaction. The
large top Yukawa coupling is naturally generated by the $SU(2)_H$ `hypercolor'

breaking is mediated to the standard model sector by a new mechanism. The
electroweak symmetry breaking is caused by the radiative correction due to the
large top Yukawa coupling with the supersymmetry breaking. This is the
`radiative breaking scenario', which originates from the dynamics of the
supercolor and hypercolor gauge interactions.
