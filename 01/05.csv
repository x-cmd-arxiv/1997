globular cluster M14, identified from an integrated-light spectrum of the
cluster obtained with the MOS spectrograph on the CFHT. From a high- resolution
echelle spectrum of the same star obtained with the Hydra fiber positioner and
bench spectrograph on the WIYN telescope, we measure a radial velocity of
$-53.0\pm1.2$ km s$^{-1}$. Although this velocity is inconsistent with
published estimates of the systemic radial velocity of M14 (eg, ${\bar {v_r}}
\approx -123$ km s$^{-1}$), we use high-precision Hydra velocities for 20 stars
in the central 2.6 arcminutes of M14 to calculate improved values for the
cluster mean velocity and one-dimensional velocity dispersion: $-59.5\pm1.9$ km
s$^{-1}$ and $8.2\pm1.4$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. Both the star's location
near the tip of the red giant branch in the cluster color magnitude diagram and
its radial velocity therefore argue for membership in M14. Since the
intermediate-resolution MOS spectrum shows not only enhanced CH absorption but
also strong Swan bands of C$_2$, M14 joins Omega Cen as the only globular
clusters known to contain classical CH stars. Although evidence for its
duplicity must await additional radial velocity measurements, the CH star in
M14 is probably, like all field CH stars, a spectroscopic binary with a
degenerate (white dwarf) secondary. The candidate and confirmed CH stars in M14
and Omega Cen, and in a number of Galactic dSph galaxies, may then owe their
existence to the long timescales for the shrinking and coalescence of hard
binaries in low-concentration environments.

chain that evolves in contact with a thermal reservoir. Damage heals at low

evolution for which such a transition is observed are as legitimate as the
conventional rules (Glauber, Metropolis, heat bath). Our second result is that
such transitions are not always in the directed percolation universality class.

  Physik B",,"10.1007/s002570050317",,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con",,"  We explore, for the first time, the effect of double fluctuations on both the
diagonal and off-diagonal self-energy. We use the T-Matrix equations below
$T_c$, developed recently by the Z\""urich group (M.H. Pedersen et al) for the
local pair attraction Hamiltonian. Here, we include as well the effect of
fluctuations on the order parameter (beyond the BCS solution) up to second
order in $U/t$. This is equivalent to approximating the effective interaction
by $U$ in the off-diagonal self-energy. For $U/t = -6.0$, $T/t = 0.05$, $\mu/t
= - 5.5$ and $\Delta/t = 1.5$, we find four peaks both for the diagonal,
$A(n(\pi/16,\pi/16),\omega)$, and off-diagonal, $B(n(\pi/16,\pi/16),\omega)$,
spectral functions. These peaks are not symmetric in pairs as previously found.
In addition: (a) in $A(n(\pi/16,\pi/16),\omega)$, the far left peak has a
vanishing small weight; (b) in $B(n(\pi/16,\pi/16),\omega)$ the far left and
far right peaks have very small weights. The physical picture is, then, that
the pair physics in the normal phase ($T > T_c$) is still valid below $T_c$.
However, the condensation of the e-h pairs produces an additional gap around
the chemical potential as in BCS, in other words, superconductivity opens a gap
in the lower branch of a Hubbard-type-I solution.

bundles. These global structures are used to refine the proof of the duality
