  minor miss-quote corrected",,"10.1093/mnras/288.2.355",,"astro-ph",,"  Observations of the evolution of the galaxy cluster X-ray luminosity function
suggest that the entropy of the intra-cluster medium plays a significant role
in determining the development of cluster X-ray properties. I present a
theoretical framework in which the evolution of the entropy of the central
intra-cluster gas is explicitly taken into account. The aim of this work is to
develop a theoretical context within which steadily improving measurements of
the X-ray luminosities and temperatures of distant galaxy clusters can be
interpreted. I discuss the possible range of entropy evolution parameters and
relate these to the physical processes heating and cooling the intra-cluster
medium. The practical application of this work is demonstrated by combining
currently available evolutionary constraints on the X-ray luminosity function
and the luminosity--temperature correlation to determine the best-fitting model
parameters.

kinematics of the nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC 2442. The Halpha emission is
very localized along the strong spiral arms of the galaxy, and shows a marked
asymmetry between the sharp, well-defined northern tidal arm and the weaker
southern arm. The velocity field appears highly distorted, with a rapidly
rotating nuclear component. We find evidence for strong non-circular motions
along the northern arm, coincident with the pronounced dust lane and regions of
intense star formation. The strong asymmetries, disturbed velocity field, and
presence of a perturbed companion suggest that we are witnessing a strong
kinematic response to a close interaction, which has redistributed the star
formation activity throughout the disk of NGC 2442. Dynamical modeling supports
this hypothesis, and suggests that the regions of strongest star formation are
coincident with strong shocks occurring along the perturbed northern arm.
Despite this redistribution of gas on small scales, this galaxy does not show a
significant departure from the Tully-Fisher relation, nor does it appear to be
experiencing any strong starburst. Moreover, our models predict that in a few x
10^8 years, NGC 2442 will have recovered from this encounter and will
experience another passage -- and ultimately a merger -- in a few Gyr. Given
the environment of many disk galaxies, this tidal encounter cycle seems likely
to be a normal phase of disk galaxy evolution.

trends defined by the optical line ratios of low redshift radio galaxies. Pure
shock models also provide a poor fit to the data. However, photoionization by a
power law of index -1.0 provides an excellent fit to the UV line ratios. This
suggests that the ionizing continuum spectral shape may depend on radio
luminosity and/or redshift, such that it becomes harder as the radio power

seeing the first signs of chemical evolution in these objects, since a
power-law of index -1.5 with low metallicity also provides a good fit to the

Galactic latitudes. A significant fraction of the detected radiation was found
to be of Galactic origin, resulting from scattering by dust in the diffuse
interstellar medium. To simulate the radiative transfer in the Galaxy, we
employed a Monte Carlo model which utilized a realistic, non-isotropic
radiation field based on the measured fluxes (at 156nm) and positions of 58,000
TD-1 stars, and a cloud structure for the interstellar medium. The comparison
of the model predictions with the observations led to a separation of the
Galactic scattered radiation from an approximately constant background,
attributed to airglow and extragalactic radiation, and to a well constrained
determination of the dust scattering properties. The derived dust albedo a =
0.45 +/- 0.05 is substantially lower than albedos derived for dust in dense
reflection nebulae and star-forming regions, while the phase function asymmetry
g = 0.68 +/- 0.10 is indicative of a strongly forward directed phase function.
We show the highly non-isotropic phase function to be responsible, in
conjunction with the non-isotropic UV radiation field, for the wide range of
observed correlations between the diffusely scattered Galactic radiation and
the column densities of neutral atomic hydrogen. The low dust albedo is
attributed to a size distribution of grains in the diffuse medium with average
sizes smaller than those in dense reflection nebulae.

that allows for structural differences amongst the profiles. The galaxy light
profiles show a trend of systematic departures from a de Vaucouleurs R^{1/4}
law, in the sense that `n' increases with increasing effective half-light
radius R_{e}. Adjustments to the measured velocity dispersion are also made,
based upon the theoretical velocity dispersion profile shapes of the different
R^{1/n} light profiles. We find that allowing for broken structural homology
through fitting R^{1/n} profiles, but still using central velocity dispersions,
actually increases the departure of the observed FP from the virial plane - the
increase in effective radius with galaxy luminosity (and `n') is over-balanced
by an associated decrease in the mean surface brightness. In examining the use
of volumetric quantities and allowing for the different velocity dispersion
profiles corresponding to the observed light profiles, we find that use of the
volumetric velocity dispersion at the volumetric half-light radius decreases
the departure of the FP from the virial plane. Through use of the Jeans
hydrodynamical equation, we further convert the projected central aperture
velocity dispersion, sigma_{0}, into the infinite aperture velocity dispersion,
sigma_{tot,n} (which is equal to one-third of the virial velocity dispersion).

electrons to travel along the c axis by making a series of interband
transitions rather than to stay within a single (and very narrow) band.
Moreover, we found that many of the properties of the normal state optical
conductivity, including the pseudogap could be explained by interband
transitions. In this work we examine the effect of superconductivity on the
interband conductivity. We find that, while the onset of superconductivity is
clearly evident in the spectrum, there is no clear signature of the symmetry of

that Hawking radiation of photons would not take place. We also conclude that

it uses the real-time evolution of parton cascades in conjunction with a
self-consistent hadronization scheme that is governed by the dynamics itself.
The causal evolution from a specific initial state (determined by the colliding
beam particles) is followed by the time-development of the phase-space
densities of partons, pre-hadronic parton clusters, and final-state hadrons, in
position-space, momentum-space and color-space. The parton-evolution is
described in terms of a space-time generalization of the familiar

involving 2 -> 2 parton collisions, 2 -> 1 parton fusion processes, and 1 -> 2
radiation processes. The formation of color-singlet pre-hadronic clusters and
their decays into hadrons, on the other hand, is treated by using a spatial
criterion motivated by confinement and a non-perturbative model for
hadronization. This article gives a brief review of the physics underlying VNI,
which is followed by a detailed description of the program itself. The latter

contributions of positive- and negative-parity excited baryon states partially
cancel each other in the chiral-odd sum rules, but add up in the chiral-even

the chiral-even sum rules. This allows one to identify the more reliable sum
rules and use them in extracting the ground-state baryon property of interest.

fusion reactions in order to provide a detailed analysis of all the possible

considered as a complex-fragment binary-decay which can be treated in the same
way as the light-particle evaporation from the compound nucleus in
statistical-model calculations. The method of the phase-space integrations for
the binary-decay is an extension of the usual Hauser-Feshbach formalism to be
applied to the mass-symmetric fission part. The EHFM calculations include
ground-state binding energies and discrete levels in the low excitation-energy
regions which are essential for an accurate evaluation of the phase-space
integrations of the complex-fragment emission (fission). In the present
calculations, EHFM is applied to the first-chance binary-decay by assuming that
the second-chance fission decay is negligible. In a similar manner to the
description of the fusion-evaporation process, the usual cascade calculation of
light-particle emission from the highly excited complex fragments is applied.
This complete calculation is then defined as EHFM+CASCADE. Calculated
quantities such as charge-, mass- and kinetic-energy distributions are compared
with inclusive and/or exclusive data for the $^{32}$S+$^{24}$Mg and
$^{35}$Cl+$^{12}$C reactions which have been selected as typical examples.
Finally, the missing charge distributions extracted from exclusive measurements

reduces corrections to the leading term. The leading term represents scattering
from an off-mass-shell parton, which keeps the same virtual mass in the final

coincides with the Bjorken variable x for $Q^2\to\infty$. Analysis of the data
shows excellent scaling at large x, where power corrections are dominant. The
approach accommodates also the QCD logarithmic corrections and the behavior of
the structure functions is well reproduced within a wide kinematical range.
Since the new scaling variable $\bar x(x,Q^2)$ incorporates the higher twist
effects, it allows us to extract the ratio $F_2^n(x)/F_2^p(x)$ for $x\to 1$

operator is studied in electron scattering processes involving the excitation
of medium and heavy nuclei to energies up to the quasi-elastic peak. The effect
of these contributions in the quasi-free electron scattering process is a
reduction of at most a 3% in the longitudinal response at the energy of the
peak, a value which is below the experimental error and must not be taken into
account in calculations in this energy region. On the other hand, the
excitation of low-lying nuclear levels of neutronic character shows, with
respect to the protonic ones, a considerable effect due to the inclusion of the
two-body term in the charge operator. More realistic calculations, such as
those performed in the random-phase approximation framework, give rise to a
mixing of one particle-one hole configurations of both kinds which reduce these
effects. However, it has been found that the excitation of some of these levels
is sizeably affected by the meson-exchange contribution. More precise
experimental data concerning some of these states, such as e.g. the high-spin
states in 208Pb, could throw some light in the problem of a more feasible
determination of these effects and, as a consequence, could provide an
alternative procedure to obtain the charge neutron form factor.
