  Holt & L.G. Mundy editors",,"10.1063/1.52790",,"astro-ph",,"  The most active starbursts are found in galaxies with the highest IR
luminosities, with peak star formation rates and efficiencies that are over an
order of magnitude higher than in normal disk systems. These systems are almost
exclusively on-going mergers. In this review I explore the conditions needed
for interactions to experience such a phase by comparing two systems at similar
stages of merging but quite different IR luminosities: NGC 4038/9 and Arp 299.
These observations show that the most intense starbursts occur at the sites
with the highest gas densities, which is a general result for IR luminous
mergers. Observations and theory both suggest that the strength of the merger
induced starburst depends on the internal structure of the progenitors, the
amount and distribution of the gas, and the violence of the interaction. In
particular, interactions involving progenitors with dense bulges, gas-rich
disks, and/or a retrograde spin are expected to preferentially lead to large
amounts of gaseous dissipation, although the interplay between these parameters
is unknown. A major outstanding question is how the effects of feedback alter
these conclusions.

of the Kraichnan model of turbulent passive scalar advection is believed to be
dominated by the homogeneous solutions (zero-modes) of the Kraichnan equation
$\hat{B}_n F_n=0$. In this paper we present an extensive analysis of the
simplest (non-trivial) case of n=3 in the isotropic sector. The main parameter
of the model, denoted as $\zeta_h$, characterizes the eddy diffusivity and can
take values in the interval $0\le \zeta_h \le 2$. After choosing appropriate
variables we can present computer-assisted non-perturbative calculations of the
zero modes in a projective two dimensional circle. In this presentation it is
also very easy to perform perturbative calculations of the scaling exponent
$\zeta_3$ of the zero modes in the limit $\zeta_h\to 0$, and we display
quantitative agreement with the non-perturbative calculations in this limit.
Another interesting limit is $\zeta_h\to 2$. This second limit is singular, and
calls for a study of a boundary layer using techniques of singular perturbation
theory. Our analysis of this limit shows that the scaling exponent $\zeta_3$
vanishes like $\sqrt{\zeta_2/log{\zeta_2}}$. In this limit as well,
perturbative calculations are consistent with the non-perturbative
calculations.
