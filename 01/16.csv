between star formation activity and the presence of bars, a representative
sample of 32 non-interacting late-type galaxies with well-determined bar
properties has been selected. We show that all the galaxies displaying the
highest current star forming activity have both strong and long bars.
Conversely not all strong and long bars are intensively creating stars. Except
for two cases, strong bars are in fact long as well. Numerical simulations
allow to understand these observational facts as well as the connection between
bar axis ratio, star formation activity, and chemical abundance gradient: Very
young strong bars are first characterized by a raging episode of star formation
and two different radial gaseous abundance gradients, one steep in the bar and
one shallow in the disc. Then, principally due to gas consumption, galaxies
progressively fall back in a more quiescent state with a nearly flat abundance
gradient across the whole galaxy. On the contrary, weak bars are unable to
trigger significant star formation or to generate flat abundance gradients. The
selected galaxies have tentatively been classified in four classes
corresponding to main stages of secular evolution scenario.

photons for each baryon in the universe, i.e., more than enough to ionize the
IGM. We calculate that the rate of these supernovae is such that about one of
them should be observable at any time per square arc minute. Their fluxes are,
of course, extremely faint: at z=5, the peak magnitude should be K=27 with a
duration of ~ 1 year. However, these supernovae should still be the brightest
objects in the universe beyond some redshift, because the earliest galaxies
should form before quasars and they should have very low mass, so their
luminosities should be much lower than that of a supernova.
  We also show that, under the assumption of a standard initial mass function,
a significant fraction of the stars in the Galactic halo should have formed in

decline significantly with time during early protostellar evolution (Bontemps
et al. 1996). In the present paper, we propose that this rapid decay of
accretion/ejection activity is a direct result of the non-singular density
profiles characterizing pre-collapse clouds. The radial density profiles of
pre-stellar cores are indeed found to be much flatter than rho(r) ~ r(-2) at
radii less than a few thousand AU (Ward-Thompson et al. 1994). Here we show,
through Lagrangian analytical calculations, that the supersonic gravitational
collapse of pre-stellar cloud cores with centrally peaked, but flattened
density profiles leads to a transitory phase of energetic accretion immediately
following the formation of the central hydrostatic protostar. Physically, the
flat inner region collapses first nearly homologously to form a finite mass
stellar nucleus, and the remaining cloud core material then accretes
supersonically onto a non-zero point mass. Enhanced accretion persists as long
as the gravitational pull of this initial point mass, which does not exist in
the Shu singular solution, remains significant. We suggest that this epoch of
vigorous accretion coincides with Class 0 protostars, which would explain their
unusually powerful jets compared to the more evolved Class I objects. We also
use a simple two-component power-law model to fit the diagrams of outflow power
versus envelope mass observed by Bontemps et al. (1996), and suggest that rho
Ophiuchi and Taurus young stellar objects follow different accretion histories
because of differing initial conditions.

values in different ``subuniverses,'' the probability distribution of its
observed values is conditioned by the requirement that there must be someone to
measure it. This probability is proportional to the fraction of matter which is
destined to condense out of the background into mass concentrations large
enough to form observers. We calculate this ``collapsed fraction'' by a simple,
pressure-free, spherically symmetric, nonlinear model for the growth of density
fluctuations in a flat universe with arbitrary value of the cosmological
constant, applied in a statistical way to the observed spectrum of density
fluctuations at recombination. From this, the probability distribution for the
vacuum energy density rho_V=Lambda/8pi G for Gaussian random density
fluctuations is derived analytically. It is shown that the results depend on
only one quantity, sigma^3 RHO, where sigma^2 and RHO are the variance and mean
value of the fluctuating matter density field at recombination, respectively.
To calculate sigma, we adopt the flat CDM model with nonzero cosmological
constant and fix the amplitude and shape of the primordial power spectrum in
accordance with data on cosmic microwave background anisotropy from the COBE
satellite DMR experiment. A comparison of the results of this calculation of
the likely values of rho_V with present observational bounds on the
cosmological constant indicates that the small, positive value of rho_V (up to
3 times greater than the present cosmic mass density) suggested recently by
several lines of evidence is a reasonably likely value to observe, even if all

Since galactic disks are rich in neutral hydrogen, the quasar spectrum will
likely be marked by a damped Lyman-alpha absorption trough at the lens
redshift. Therefore, the efficiency of searches for gravitational lensing with
sub-arcsecond splitting can be enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude by focusing
on a subset of all bright quasars which show low-redshift (z<1) strong

lensing could, in principle, be identified spectroscopically and without the

Over one third (34 per cent) of clusters of richness class R>=1 are
miclassifications arising from the projection of one or more clumps onto an
intrinsically poor cluster. Conversely, 32 per cent of intrinsically rich
clusters are missed from the R>=1 catalogues, mostly because of statistical
fluctuations in the background count. Selection by X-ray luminosity rather than
optical richness reduces, but does not completely eliminate, these problems.
Contamination by unvirialised sub-clumps near a cluster leads to a considerable
overestimation of the cluster velocity dispersion, even if the analysis is
restricted only to galaxies close to the cluster centre. Thus, the distribution
of cluster masses - often used to test cosmological models - is a highly
unreliable statistic. However, the median value of the distribution is
considerably more robust. Improved estimates of the cluster velocity dispersion
distribution require constructing new cluster catalogues in which clusters are
defined according to the number of galaxies within a radius about three times

in these clusters define very clear Fundamental Plane relations, confirming an
earlier result for Cl0024+16 at $z=0.39$. This large sample allows us to
estimate the scatter reliably. We find it to be low, at 0.067 dex in $\log

clusters. This suggests that the structure of the older galaxies has changed
little since $z=0.58$.

evolution is consistent with $\Delta \log M/L_V \sim -0.3z$. The $M/L_V$ ratios
of two E+A galaxies in Cl1358+62 are also lower by a factor of $\sim 3$,
consistent with the hypothesis that they underwent a starburst 1 Gyr
previously. We conclude that the Fundamental Plane can therefore be used as a
sensitive diagnostic of the evolutionary history of galaxies. Our data, when
compared to the predictions of simple stellar population models, imply that the
oldest cluster galaxies formed at high redshift ($z > 2$). We infer a different
evolutionary history for the E+A galaxies, in which a large fraction of stars
formed at $z<1$. Larger samples spanning a larger redshift range are needed to

production leads to the reheating of the universe. Such explosive particle
production is due to parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations for the

instabilities in the broken symmetry phase(which is the case in new inflation).
The self-consistent methods presented in these lectures are the only
approaches, so far, that lead to reliable quantitative results on the reheating
mechanism in the inflationary universe. They fully use the field theoretical
Schwinger-Keldysh out of equilibrium method in a non-perturbative way. These

modes and exactly conserve energy (covariantly). Simplified analysis that do
not include the full backreaction and do not conserve energy, result in unbound
particle production and lead to quantitatively erroneous results. For
spontaneously broken theories the issue of whether the symmetry may be restored
or not by the quantum fluctuations is analyzed. The precise criterion for
symmetry restoration is presented. The field dynamics is symmetric when the
energy density in the initial state is larger than the top of the tree level
potential. When the initial energy density is below the top of the tree level
potential, the symmetry is broken.

  Monographs, m51 (Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, 1997) ISBN 3-540-63509-2",,,,"hep-th math.QA q-alg",,"  These lectures notes are an intoduction for physicists to several ideas and
applications of noncommutative geometry. The necessary mathematical tools are
presented in a way which we feel should be accessible to physicists. We
illustrate applications to Yang-Mills, fermionic and gravity models, notably we
describe the spectral action recently introduced by Chamseddine and Connes. We
also present an introduction to recent work on noncommutative lattices. The
latter have been used to construct topologically nontrivial quantum mechanical
and field theory models, in particular alternative models of lattice gauge
theory.
  Here is the list of sections:
  1. Introduction. 2. Noncommutative Spaces and Algebras of Functions. 3.
Noncommutative Lattices. 4. Modules as Bundles. 5. The Spectral Calculus. 6.
Noncommutative Differential Forms. 7. Connections on Modules. 8. Field Theories
on Modules. 9. Gravity Models. 10. Quantum Mechanical Models on Noncommutative
Lattices.

  text have been added",,,"NPI MSU 97-7/458","hep-th math.QA q-alg",,"  A definition is given and the physical meaning of quantum transformations of
a non-commutative configuration space (quantum group coactions) is discussed.
It is shown that non-commutative coordinates which are transformed by quantum
groups are the natural generalization of the notion of a tensor operator for
usual groups and that the quantum group coactions induce semigroups of
transformations of states of a system. Two examples of non-commutative
transformations and the corresponding semigroups are considered.

method. The results show perfect agreements with existing low-energy $n-d$ and
$p-d$ scattering calculations.

important role of the Delta-resonance contribution to the elastic pi
D-scattering is confirmed.

Schrodinger equation for interacting many-body systems are presented in some
detail. These algorithms would make it possible to simulate nonrelativistic
quantum systems on a quantum computer with an exponential speedup compared to
simulations on classical computers. Issues involved in simulating relativistic
systems of Dirac and gauge particles are discussed.

phase damping) of the qubits (two-state quantum systems) due to the inevitable
coupling to the same environment are investigated. It is found that the qubits
undergo the dissipation coherently in this case. In particular, for a special
kind of input states (called the coherence-preserving states), whose form
depends on the type of the coupling, loss and decoherence in quantum memory are
much reduced. Based on this phenomenon, a scheme by encoding the general input
states of the qubits into the corresponding coherence-preserving states is
proposed for reducing the cooperative loss and decoherence in quantum
computation or communication.
