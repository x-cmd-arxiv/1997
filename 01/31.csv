  ApJ, Vol. 482",,"10.1086/304187",,"astro-ph",,"  We have analyzed the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of six elliptical and S0
galaxies in order to characterize their hot stellar populations. The spectra
were obtained using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) in March 1995.
These data, together with the spectra of two galaxies observed with HUT in
1990, represent the only FUV spectra of early type galaxies that extend to the
Lyman limit at 912 A and therefore include the ""turnover"" in the spectral
energy distribution below Lyman alpha. Using an extensive new grid of synthetic
spectra which match the HUT resolution and cover the relevant parameter space
of temperature and gravity, we have constructed synthetic spectral energy
distributions by integrating over predicted stellar evolutionary tracks for
horizontal branch stars and their progeny. When the models are compared with
the HUT data, we find that those with supersolar metal abundances and helium
best reproduce the flux across the entire HUT wavelength range, while those
with subsolar Z & Y fit less well, partly because of a significant flux deficit
shortward of 970 A in the models. We find that AGB-Manque evolution is required
in all fits to the HUT spectra, suggesting that all of the galaxies have some
subdwarf B star population. At any Z & Y, the models that best match the HUT
flux are dominated by stars evolving from a narrow range of envelope mass on
the blue end of the horizontal branch.

unity slope when deviations are expressed in terms of the native representation
(the mean ISM), the evolution line can become a slope 4/3 line in the solar

relating the solar composition to that of the mean ISM at the time of solar

magnitude, rather than color or spectral features. We find no obvious change in
the shape or slope of the relation with respect to the local Tully-Fisher

presumably caused by luminosity evolution in the field galaxy population, and
does not correlate with galaxy mass. A comparison of disk surface brightness
between local and high-redshift samples yields a similar offset, ~0.6 mag.

temperatures of 15-100 K, and the cloud in the giant HII region has a
temperature of at least 100 K. Interestingly, the giant HII region appears

that the unusual physical conditions in the cloud in the giant HII region are

neutron stars make all the properties of an atom strongly dependent on the
transverse component K_\perp of its generalized momentum. In particular, the
photoionization process is modified substantially: (i) threshold energies are
decreased as compared with those for an atom at rest, (ii) cross section values
are changed significantly, and (iii) selection rules valid for atoms at rest
are violated by the motion so that new photoionization channels become allowed.
To calculate the photoionization cross sections, we, for the first time, employ
exact numerical treatment of both initial and final atomic states. This enables
us to take into account the quasi-bound (autoionizing) atomic states as well as
coupling of different ionization channels. We extend the previous
consideration, restricted to the so-called centered states corresponding to
relatively small values of K_\perp, to arbitrary states of atomic motion. We
fold the cross sections with the thermal distribution of atoms over K. For
typical temperatures of neutron star atmospheres, the averaged cross sections
differ substantially from those of atoms at rest. In particular, the
photoionization edges are strongly broadened by the thermal motion of atoms;
this ""magnetic broadening"" exceeds the usual Doppler broadening by orders of
magnitude. The decentered states of the atoms give rise to the low-energy
component of the photoionization cross section. This new component grows
significantly with increasing temperature above 10^{5.5} K and decreasing
density below 1 g/cm^3, i.e., for the conditions expected in atmospheres of
middle-aged neutron stars.

hole-doped domain and a (magnetic) domain near half filling, with long-range
Coulomb forces limiting the separation to a nanoscopic scale. Strong
correlation effects pin the Fermi level close to, but not precisely at the Van
Hove singularity (VHS), which can enhance the tendency to phase separation. The
resulting dispersions have been calculated, both in the uniform phases and in
the phase separated regime. In the latter case, distinctly different
dispersions are found for large, random domains and for regular (static)
striped arrays, and a hypothetical form is presented for dynamic striped
arrays. The doping dependence of the latter is found to provide an excellent
description of photoemission and thermodynamic experiments on pseudogap
formation in underdoped cuprates. In particular, the multiplicity of observed
gaps is explained as a combination of flux phase plus charge density wave (CDW)
gaps along with a superconducting gap. The largest gap is associated with VHS
nesting. The apparent smooth evolution of this gap with doping masks a
crossover from CDW-like effects near optimal doping to magnetic effects (flux
phase) near half filling. A crossover from large Fermi surface to hole pockets
with increased underdoping is found. In the weakly overdoped regime, the CDW
undergoes a quantum phase transition ($T_{CDW}\to 0$), which could be obscured

We show that variations of the electron polarization along the neutrino
trajectory can induce resonant conversions in the active-sterile neutrino
system, but cannot lead to level crossing in the active-active neutrino system.
For neutrino flavour conversions the polarisation leads only to a shift of the
standard MSW resonance. For polarizations $\lambda \lsim 0.04$ the direct
modifications of the potential (density) due to the magnetic field pressure are
smaller than the modifications due to the polarization effect. We estimate that
indeed the typical magnitude of the polarization in the sun or in a supernova

may lead to interesting consequences for supernova physics and for properties

expresses the symmetry with respect to the suffix-permutation within an

piN->K+Y) incoherent production processes on the basis of an appropriate new
folding model, which takes properly into account the struck target nucleon
removal energy and momentum distribution (nucleon spectral function), extracted
from recent quasielastic electron scattering experiments and from many-body
calculations with realistic models of the NN interaction. Comparison of the
model calculations of the K+ double differential cross sections for the
reaction p+C at 1.2, 1.5 and 2.5 GeV beam energies with the existing
experimental data from the SATURNE experiment is given, illustrating both the
relative role of the primary and secondary production channels at considered
incident energies and those features of the cross sections which are sensitive
to the high momentum and high removal energy part of the nucleon spectral
function that is governed by nucleon-nucleon short-range and tensor
correlations. In--medium modifications of the available for pion and hyperon
production invariant energies squared due to the respective optical potentials
are needed to account for the experimental data on K+ production in the energy
region under consideration.

full permutation symmetry of the wavefunction and which is suitable for any
phase space parametrization is developed. The properties of the resulting mixed
ensembles and the two-particle correlation function are discussed. A physical
interpretation of the chaoticity lambda as localizat of the pions in the source
is presented.
  Two techniques to generate test-particles, which satisfy the probability
densities of the wavepacket state, are studied:
  1. A Monte Carlo procedure in momentum space based on the standard Metropolis
technique.
  2. A molecular dynamic procedure using Bohm's quantum theory of motion.
  In order to reduce the numerical complexity, the separation of the
wavefunction into momentum space clusters is discussed. In this context th
influence of an unauthorized factorization of the state, i. e. the omissio of
interference terms, is investigated. It is shown that the correlation radius
remains almost uneffected, but the chaoticity parameter decreases
substantially. A similar effect is observed in systems with high multiplic
where the omission of higher order corrections in the analysis of two-part
correlations causes a reduction of the chaoticity and the radius.
  The approximative treatment of the Coulomb interaction between pions and
source is investigated. The results suggest that Coulomb effects on the co
radii are not symmetric for pion pairs of different charges. For negative the
radius, integrated over the whole momentum spectrum, increases substan while
for positive pions the radius remains almost unchanged.
