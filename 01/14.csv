Here, we estimate the source density of these variables while consistently
accounting for spatial incompleteness in data using a likelihood approach. The
existence of the bar is confirmed with shoulder of 4 kpc and position angle of
19 +/- 1 degrees. The ratio of non-axisymmetric to axisymmetric components
gives similar estimate for the bar size 3.3 +/- 0.1 kpc and position angle 24
+/- 2 degrees. We estimate a scale length 4.00 +/- 0.55 kpc for the IRAS
variable population, suggesting that these stars represent the old disk
population. We use this density reconstruction to estimate the optical depth to
microlensing for the large-scale bar in the Galactic disk. We find an
enhancement over an equivalent axisymmetric disk by 30% but still too small to
account for the MACHO result. In addition, we predict a significant asymmetry
at positive and negative longitudes along lines of sight through the end of the
bar with optical depths comparable to that in Baade's window. An infrared
microlensing survey may be a sensitive tool for detecting or constraining
structural asymmetries. More generally, this is a pilot study for Bayesian star
count analyses. Bayesian approach allows the assessment of prior probabilities
to the unknown parameters of the model; the resulting likelihood function is
straightforwardly modified to incorporate all available data.

the short-time X-ray variability of active galactic nuclei. Previous works on
this subject were mostly concentrated on temporal characteristics and power
spectra of observed light curves. In our present contribution, Fourier phases
are brought into consideration and studied systematically for a broad range of

simple model for the source variation and forming a chi squared measure of the
agreement of this same variation with all of the lightcurves. While inspired by
Press et al. (1992a, b) our approach is different since we do not assume a
Gaussian process for the source variation. We apply our method to the light
curves of the quadruple gravitational lens PG1115+080 measured by Schechter et
al. (1997). Unlike Schechter et al. we include correlated measurement errors in
the analysis, as well as the possibility that microlensing may cause different
images to vary by different factors in flux. We find a value of 25.0
(+3.3,-3.8) days (95% confidence) for the delay between components B and C
(close to the 24 day value of Schechter et al). However, the ratio t_AC/t_BA of
the two intermediate delays is poorly determined at 1.13 (+.18,-.17) (68%

prescription with alpha in the range 0.1-0.01, and ratio of viscous speed to
sound speed in the range 0.02-0.5, details in the boundary layer are strongly
affected by the causality constraint. We study both steady state polytropic
models and time dependent models, taking into account energy dissipation and
transport. Steady state solutions are always subviscous with a variety of
$\Omega$ profiles which may exhibit near discontinuities. For alpha =0.01 and
small viscous speeds, the boundary layer adjusted to a near steady state. A
long wavelength oscillation generated by viscous overstability could be seen at
times near the outer boundary. Being confined there, the boundary layer
remained almost stationary. However, for alpha =0.1 and large viscous speeds,
short wavelength disturbances were seen throughout which could significantly
affect the power output in the boundary layer. This could be potentially
important in producing time dependent behaviour in accreting systems such as
CVs and protostars.

in the density of states at the top of the valence band. As the electronic
density $< n >$ decreases further away from half-filling, the chemical
potential travels through this energy window with a large number of states, and
by $< n > \sim 0.70$ it has crossed it entirely. The region near momentum
$(0,\pi)$ and $(\pi,0)$ in the spectral function is more sensitive to doping

Model (SM) gauge interactions are the mediators of supersymmetry breaking to
the fields in the supersymmetric SM, but where the SM gauge groups couple
directly to the sector which breaks supersymmetry dynamically. Despite the
direct coupling, the models preserve perturbative unification of the SM gauge
coupling constants. Furthermore, the supergravity contributions to the squark
and slepton masses can be naturally small, typically being much less than 1% of
the gauge mediated contributions. Both of these goals can be achieved without
need of a fine-tuning or a very small coupling constant. This scheme requires
run-away directions at the renormalizable level which are only lifted by
non-renormalizable terms in the superpotential. To study the proposed scheme in
practice, we develop a modified class of models based on $SU(N)\times SU(N-1)$
which allows us to gauge a $SU(N-2)$ global symmetry. However, we point out a
new problem which can exist in models where the dynamical supersymmetry
breaking sector and the ordinary sector are directly coupled -- the two-loop
renormalization group has contributions which can induce negative $(mass)^2$
for the squarks and sleptons. We clarify the origin of the problem and argue
that it is likely to be surmountable. We give a recipe for a successful model.

characteristic $0$. A subalgebra $R$ of $K[x, y]$ is called a retract if there
is an idempotent homomorphism (a {\it retraction}, or {\it projection})
$\varphi: K[x, y] \to K[x, y]$ such that $\varphi(K[x, y]) = R$. The presence
of other, equivalent, definitions of retracts provides several different
methods of studying them, and brings together ideas from combinatorial algebra,
homological algebra, and algebraic geometry. In this paper, we characterize all
the retracts of $ K[x, y]$ up to an automorphism, and give several applications
of this characterization, in particular, to the well-known Jacobian conjecture.
Notably, we prove that if a polynomial mapping $\varphi$ of $K[x,y]$ has
invertible Jacobian matrix {\it and } fixes a non-constant polynomial, then
$\varphi$ is an automorphism.

effective field theory with hadrons and photons is constructed, which includes
non-resonant Born terms as well as the S$_{11}$(1535) and S$_{11}$(1650) baryon
resonances. Due to the coupling between the channels, the production of
eta-mesons is strongly affected by the S$_{11}$(1650) although its direct
coupling to the $\eta$N channel is negligible. The rho- and omega-meson
exchange terms are important for achieving a consistent description of both
pion- and photon-induced reactions.

chaotic sources the true three-particle correlation term is shown to be
sensitive to the momentum dependence of the saddle point of the source and to
its asymmetries around that point. For partially coherent sources the
three-pion correlator allows to measure the degree of coherence without
contamination from resonance decays. We derive the most general Gaussian
parametrization of the two- and three-particle correlator for this case and
discuss the space-time interpretation of the corresponding parameters.

cancelled by the single pion production contribution. But the incoherent

empirically with a variety of search problems, and shown to be particularly
effective for searches with many constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm
provides a simple framework for utilizing search heuristics. It also exhibits
the same phase transition in search difficulty as found for sophisticated
classical search methods, indicating it is effectively using the problem
