then a soft-to-hard state transition. The low-energy X-ray (1.3-12 keV) and
high-energy X-ray (20-200 keV) fluxes are strongly anti-correlated during this
period. During the state transitions flux variations of about a factor of 5 and
15 were seen in the 1.3-3.0 keV and 100-200 keV bands, respectively, while the
average 4.8-12 keV flux remains almost unchanged. The net effect of this
pivoting is that the total 1.3-200 keV luminosity remained unchanged to within
about 15%. The bolometric luminosity in the soft state may be as high as 50-70%
above the hard state luminosity, after color corrections for the luminosity
below 1.3 keV. The blackbody component flux and temperature increase in the
soft state is probably caused by a combination of the optically thick disk mass
accretion rate increase and a decrease of the inner disk radius.

Because the purely spherical infall model does not predict the amplitude of the

Omega_0 based on this model yield unreliable biased results. In fact, the
amplitude of the velocity field depends on local dynamics and only very weakly
on the global properties of the universe. We use N-body simulations of flat and
open universes to show that the amplitude of the velocity field of the infall
regions of dark matter halos is a direct measure of the escape velocity within
these regions. We can use this amplitude to estimate the mass of dark matter
halos within a few megaparsecs from the halo center. In this region dynamical
equilibrium assumptions do not hold. The method yields a mass estimate with
better than 30% accuracy. If galaxies trace the velocity field of the infall

estimate the amount of mass surrounding rich galaxy clusters from redshift data
alone.

breaking effects are mediated by gauge interactions at about the 10^5 GeV
scale. We first point out that the gravitino is likely to overclose the
Universe in this class of models. This requires an entropy production, which
prefers a baryogenesis mechanism at a relatively low temperature. The
Affleck-Dine mechanism for baryogenesis is one of the possibilities to generate
enough baryon asymmetry, but the analysis is non-trivial since the shape of the
potential for the flat direction differs substantially from the conventional
hidden sector case. To see this, we first perform a 2-loop calculation to
determine the shape of the potential. By combining the potential with the
supergravity contribution, we then find that the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis
works efficiently to generate sufficient baryon asymmetry. On the other hand,
we also point out that string moduli fields, if present, are stable and their
coherent oscillations overclose the Universe by more than 15 orders of
magnitude. One needs a very late inflationary period with an e-folding of N
\gtrsim 5 and an energy density of \lesssim (10^7 GeV)^4. A thermal inflation
is enough for this purpose. Fortunately, the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis is so
efficient that enough baryon asymmetry can survive the late inflation.

makes it necessary to study boundary conditions which involve both normal and
tangential derivatives of the quantized field. The resulting one-loop
divergences can be studied by means of the asymptotic expansion of the heat
kernel, and a particular case of their general structure is here analyzed in
detail. The interior and boundary contributions to heat-kernel coefficients are
written as linear combinations of all geometric invariants of the problem. The
behaviour of the differential operator and of the heat kernel under conformal
rescalings of the background metric leads to recurrence relations which,
jointly with the boundary conditions, may determine these linear combinations.
Remarkably, they are expressed in terms of universal functions, independent of
the dimension of the background and invariant under conformal rescalings, and
new geometric invariants contribute to heat-kernel asymptotics. Such technique
is applied to the evaluation of the A(1) coefficient when the matrices
occurring in the boundary operator commute with each other. Under these
assumptions, the form of the A(3/2) and A(2) coefficients is obtained for the
first time, and new equations among universal functions are derived. A
generalized formula, relating asymptotic heat kernels with different boundary
conditions, is also obtained.
