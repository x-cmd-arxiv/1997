also have power-law density profiles: a mass group near 0.7 \Msun has a
logarithmic slope of -0.56 +- 0.05 (1-sigma) over the radial range from 2'' to
10''. Taken together, the two slopes are not well matched by the simplest
core-collapse or black-hole models. We also measure a mass function at r =

segregation, when compared with a mass function measured with the WFPC2 at r =

representative elliptical galaxies and the bulge of the Sombrero galaxy. Here
we fit in detail about 20 absorption lines and 6 optical and near-infrared
colors following two approaches: fitting a single-age single-metallicity model
and fitting our full chemical evolutionary model. We find that all of the iron
lines are weaker than the best fitting models predict, indicating that the
iron-abundance is anomalous and deficient. We also find that the Ca_I index at
4227 A is much lower than predicted by the models. We can obtain good fits for
all the other lines and observed colors with models of old and metal-rich
stellar populations, and can show that the observed radial gradients are due to
metallicity decreasing outward. We find that good fits are obtained both with
fully evolutionary models and with single-age single-metallicity models. This
is due to the fact that in the evolutionary model more than 80% of stars form
with in 1.5 Gyr after the formation of the galaxies. The fact that slightly
better fits are obtained with evolutionary models indicates these galaxies
contain a small spread in metallicity.

known towards the Pleiades cluster, with the aim of investigating the sequence
that connects cluster very low-mass (VLM) stars with substellar objects. We
find that IR data combined with optical magnitudes are a useful tool to
discriminate cluster members from foreground/background late-type field stars
contaminating optical surveys. The bottom of the Pleiades sequence is clearly
defined by the faint HHJ objects as the VLM stars approaching the substellar
limit (SL), by the transition object PPl15, which will barely ignite its H
content, and by the two brown dwarfs (BDs) Calar3 and Teide1. Binarity amongst
cluster members could account for the large dispersion observed in the faint
end of the IR colour- magnitude diagrams. Two objects in our sample, namely
HHJ6 and PPl15, are overluminous compared to other members, suggesting probable
binarity. We have reproduced the photometric measurements of both of them by
combining the magnitudes of cluster VLM stars and BDs and using the most recent
theoretical evolutionary tracks. The likely masses of the components are
slightly above the SL for HHJ6, while they are 0.080 and 0.045+-0.010 Msun for
PPl15. These masses are consistent with the constraints imposed by the
published Li observations of these Pleiads. We find a single object IR sequence
in the Pleiades connecting VLM stars and BDs. We propose that the SL (~0.075
Msun) in the Pleiades (~120 Myr) takes place at absolute magnitudes

radius of an accretion disk either heats or cools gas at other radii through
Compton scattering. We discuss three situations:
  1. Radiation from the inner regions of an advection-dominated flow Compton
cooling gas at intermediate radii and Compton heating gas at large radii.
  2. Soft radiation from an outer thin accretion disk Compton cooling a hot
one- or two-temperature flow on the inside.
  3. Soft radiation from an inner thin accretion disk Compton cooling hot gas
in a surrounding one-temperature flow.
  We describe how previous results are modified by these non-local
interactions. We find that Compton heating or cooling of the gas by the
radiation emitted in the inner regions of a hot flow is not important.
Likewise, Compton cooling by the soft photons from an outer thin disk is
negligible when the transition from a cold to a hot flow occurs at a radius
greater than some minimum $R_{tr,min}$. However, if the hot flow terminates at
$R < R_{tr,min}$, non-local cooling is so strong that the hot gas is cooled to
a thin disk configuration in a runaway process. In the case of a thin disk
surrounded by a hot one-temperature flow, we find that Compton cooling by soft
radiation dominates over local cooling in the hot gas for $\dot{M} \gsim
10^{-3} \alpha \dot{M}_{Edd}$, and $R \lsim 10^4 R_{Schw}$. As a result, the
maximum accretion rate for which an advection-dominated one-temperature

$r_{0}$ (the value of $r$ at which $\xi_{cc}(r)$ is equal to unity). For

calculations consider periodic sections of flows containing magnetic fields
parallel to the shear layer, but projecting over a full range of angles with
respect to the flow vectors. They are intended as preparation for fully 3D
calculations and to address two specific questions raised in earlier work: 1)
What role, if any, does the orientation of the field play in nonlinear
evolution of the MHD Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in 2 1/2 D. 2) Given that the
field is too weak to stabilize against a linear perturbation of the flow, how
does the nonlinear evolution of the instability depend on strength of the
field. The magnetic field component in the third direction contributes only
through minor pressure contributions, so the flows are essentially 2D. Even a
very weak field can significantly enhance the rate of energy dissipation. In
all of the cases we studied magnetic field amplification by stretching in the
vortex is limited by tearing mode, ``fast'' reconnection events that isolate
and then destroy magnetic flux islands within the vortex and relax the fields
outside the vortex. If the magnetic tension developed prior to reconnection is
comparable to Reynolds stresses in the flow, that flow is reorganized during
reconnection. Otherwise, the primary influence on the plasma is generation of
entropy. The effective expulsion of flux from the vortex is very similar to

flat, time is absolute with instantaneous causal influences, and the degenerate
`metric' structure of spacetime remains fixed with two mutually orthogonal
non-dynamical metrics, one spatial and the other temporal. The spacetime
according to this theory is, nevertheless, curved, duly respecting the
principle of equivalence, and the non-metric gravitational connection-field is
dynamical in the sense that it is determined by matter distributions. Here,
this generally-covariant but Galilean-relativistic theory of gravity with a
possible non-zero cosmological constant, viewed as a parameterized gauge theory
of a gravitational vector-potential minimally coupled to a complex
Schroedinger-field (bosonic or fermionic), is successfully cast -- for the
first time -- into a manifestly covariant Lagrangian form. Then, exploiting the
fact that Newton-Cartan spacetime is intrinsically globally-hyperbolic with a
fixed causal structure, the theory is recast both into a constraint-free
Hamiltonian form in 3+1-dimensions and into a manifestly covariant reduced
phase-space form with non-degenerate symplectic structure in 4-dimensions.
Next, this Newton-Cartan-Schroedinger system is non-perturbatively quantized
using the standard C*-algebraic technique combined with the geometric procedure
of manifestly covariant phase-space quantization. The ensuing unitary quantum
field theory of Newtonian gravity coupled to Galilean-relativistic matter is
not only generally-covariant, but also exactly soluble.

of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the nucleon propagator in renormalizable
models with Yukawa-type meson-nucleon couplings, as shown many years ago by
Brown, Puff, and Wilets (BPW). These ghosts violate basic theorems of quantum
field theory and their origin is related to the ultraviolet behavior of the
model interactions. Recently, Krein et.al, proved that the ghosts disappear
when vertex corrections are included in a self-consistent way, softening the
interaction sufficiently in the ultraviolet region. In previous studies of
pion-nucleon scattering using ""dressed"" nucleon propagator and bare vertices,
did by Nutt and Wilets in the 70's (NW), it was found that if these poles are
explicitly included, the value of the isospin-even amplitude A+ is satisfied
within 20% at threshold. The absence of a theoretical explanation for the
ghosts and the lack of chiral symmetry in these previous studies led us to
re-investigate the subject using the approach of the linear-sigma model and
study the interplay of low-energy theorems for pion-nucleon scattering and
ghost poles. For bare interaction vertices we find that ghosts are present in
this model as well and that the A+ value is badly described. As a first
approach to remove these complex poles, we dress the vertices with
phenomenological form factors and a reasonable agreement with experiment is
achieved. In order to fix the two cutoff parameters, we use the A+ value for
the chiral limit (m_pion -> 0) and the experimental value of the isoscalar
scattering length. Finally, we test our model by calculating the phase shifts
for the S waves and we find a good agreement at threshold.

amplitude is maintained. On general arguments we show that the coherent process
is sensitive to only one of the elementary amplitudes. Moreover, we show that
the nuclear structure information is fully contained in the ground-state tensor
density. The tensor density is evaluated in a mean-field approximation to the
Walecka model and it is shown to be sensitive to relativistic effects.
Distortion effects are incorporated through an eta-nucleus optical potential
