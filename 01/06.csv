Weinberg, Jordi Miralda-Escude, Lars Hernquist, and Neal Katz","A Lower Bound on the Cosmic Baryon Density","AASlatex, 15 pages w/ 1 embedded ps figure. Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/304893",,"astro-ph",,"  We derive analytic lower bounds on the cosmic baryon density by requiring
that the high-redshift IGM contain enough neutral hydrogen to produce the
observed \lya absorption in quasar spectra. The key theoretical assumption is
that absorbing structures are no more extended in redshift space than in real
space. This assumption might not hold if \lya clouds are highly overdense and
thermally broadened, but it is likely to hold in the gravitational instability
picture for the \lya forest suggested by cosmological simulations,
independently of the details of the cosmological model. The other ingredients
in these bounds are an estimate of the UV background from quasars, a
temperature $T~10^4K$ for the ""warm"" photoionized IGM that produces most of the
\lya absorption, a value of the Hubble constant, and observational estimates of
the mean \lya flux decrement $\Dbar$ or, for a more restrictive bound, the
distribution function $P(\tau)$ of \lya optical depths. With plausible
parameter values, the mean decrement bound implies a baryon density parameter
$\Omb \ga 0.0125/h^2$. With conservative values, the bound weakens to $\Omb \ga
0.005/h^2$, but the required clustering of the IGM is then incompatible with
other properties of quasar spectra. A recent observational determination of
$P(\tau)$ implies $\Omb \ga 0.0125/h^2$ even for a conservative estimate of the
UV background, and $\Omb \ga 0.018/h^2$ for a more reasonable estimate. These
bounds are consistent with recent low estimates of the primordial
deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio $\dtoh$, which imply $\Omb \approx 0.025/h^2$, but
the $P(\tau)$ bound can only be reconciled with high $\dtoh$ estimates by
abandoning standard big bang nucleosynthesis or the gravitational instability
picture for the origin of the \lya forest. (Shortened abstract.)

triangular-lattice frustrated XY model. The model can be physically realized as
a Josephson-junction array with two different couplings, in a magnetic field
corresponding to half-flux quanta per plaquette. Mean-field approximation,
Ginzburg-Landau expansion and finite-size scaling of Monte Carlo simulations
are used to study the phase diagram and critical behavior. Depending on the
value of $\rho$, two separate transitions or a transition line in the
universality class of the XY-Ising model, with combined $Z_2$ and U(1)
symmetries, takes place. In particular, the phase transitions of the standard
square-lattice and triangular-lattice frustrated XY models correspond to two
different cuts through the same transition line. Estimates of the chiral
($Z_2$) critical exponents on this transition line deviate significantly from
the pure Ising values, consistent with that along the critical line of the

transformed into a lattice field theory defined over Efetov's sigma model space

continuum limit of the lattice theory is shown to be a supersymmetric version
of Pruisken's nonlinear sigma model with couplings sigma_xx = sigma_xy = N/2 at
the symmetric point. It follows that the model for N = 2, which describes a
spin degenerate Landau level and the random flux problem, is noncritical. On
the basis of symmetry considerations and inspection of the Hamiltonian limit, a
modified network model is formulated, which still lies in the quantum Hall

coherent population trapping state in the lambda system and suppresses a
previously discovered sharp dip in the steady state response. In the ladder
system the observed minimum disappears in the presence of an incoherent pump on
the upper transition.

consisting of a loop to which a halfline lead is attached; this system is
placed into a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the loop plane. We
derive the reflection amplitude and show that there is an infinite ladder of
resonances; analyzing the resonance pole trajectories we show that half of them
turn into true embedded eigenvalues provided the flux through the loop is an
integer or halfinteger multiple of the flux unit $hc/e$. We also describe a
general method to solve the scattering problem on graphs of which the present
model is a simple particular case. Finally, we discuss ways in which a state
localized initially at the loop decays.
