colliding Alfv\'en waves. We find that the resolution to much of the confusion
lies in the existence of a new type of turbulence, intermediate turbulence, in
which the cascade of energy in the inertial range exhibits properties
intermediate between those of weak and strong turbulent cascades. Some
properties of intermediate MHD turbulence are: (i) in common with weak
turbulent cascades, wave packets belonging to the inertial range are long
lived; (ii) however, components of the strain tensor are so large that, similar
to the situation in strong turbulence, perturbation theory is not applicable;
(iii) the breakdown of perturbation theory results from the divergence of
neighboring field lines due to wave packets whose perturbations in velocity and
magnetic fields are localized, but whose perturbations in displacement are not;
(iv) 3--wave interactions dominate individual collisions between wave packets,
but interactions of all orders $n\geq 3$ make comparable contributions to the
intermediate turbulent energy cascade; (v) successive collisions are correlated
since wave packets are distorted as they follow diverging field lines; (vi) in
common with the weak MHD cascade, there is no parallel cascade of energy, and
the cascade to small perpendicular scales strengthens as it reaches higher wave
numbers; (vii) For an appropriate weak excitation, there is a natural
progression from a weak, through an intermediate, to a strong cascade.

agreement between the shapes of simulated and observed distributions is
achieved by globally scaling the optical depth to match the mean flux
decrements. This procedure amounts to a measurement of the parameter Omega_b^2

intensities from the UV to the NIR. In particular, the hitherto elusive NIR
features [SIII]9062+9531 as well as high-ionization lines like [FeVII] are
consistently fitted. The predictions of CIII] and CIV are considerably
improved. From the detailed analysis of single-component photoionization models
we derive the minimal radial extent of the NLR and the necessary span in
density. Furthermore, we determine constraints on suggestions made about the
role of matter-bounded clouds, and on proposed explanations for large
[OIII]4363/5007 ratios (the so-called `temperature problem'), and assess the
usability of some emission-line ratios as indicators of the ionization
parameter. We find that a systematic variation of the cloud column densities in
a population of matter-bounded clouds is inconsistent with the trends and
correlations exhibited by the emission lines in the diagnostic diagrams.
Concerning the temperature problem, the only possibility that leads to an
overall consistency with the strengths of all other observed emission lines is
subsolar metal abundances (as compared to e.g. the presence of dust, the
existence of a high-density component, or matter-bounded clouds). In addition,
the consequences of the presence of (Galactic-ISM-like) dust internal to the
clouds were investigated. These models alleviate the [OIII]-ratio problem but
did not lead to overall consistent fits. In our final model series, the NLR is
composed of a mixture of metal-depleted (0.5 x solar) clouds with a
radius-independent range in densities (10^2 to 10^5 cm^-3) distributed over a
range of distances from the nucleus (galactocentric radii from at least $\sim$
10^{20} cm to 10^{21.5} cm, for $Q_{tot} = 10^{54}$ s^{-1}). In order to
encompass the observed range of each line intensity relative to H$\beta$, it
turns out to be necessary to vary the spectral energy distribution incident on
the clouds, qualitatively confirming the findings of Ho et al. (1993). We found
a successful continuum sequence by adding an increasing contribution of a hot
black body ($T \approx 200000$ K) to a steep powerlaw ($\alpha_{uv-x} \approx
-2$). These continua imply that low and high-excitation objects differ in the

$2\pi\phi_y$. The components of the twist are associated with two components of
the magnetic flux in torus geometry. An analytical expression is obtained for
the energy and for the components of the persistent current (PC) at a given
flux and temperature. It is shown that at zero temperature the PC density is
proportional to the vector potential with the coefficient which does not depend
on the size of the system. This happens because the Fermi surface for a square
lattice at filling factor 1/2 is flat. Both the energy and the PC are periodic
functions of the two flux components with the periods $\phi_0/q$ and $\phi_0/s$
where $\phi_0=hc/e$, and $q$ and $s$ are integers which depend on the aspect
ratio of the rectangle. The magnitude of PC is the same as in superconductors.
Therefore, a 3D system constructed from a macroscopic number of isolated
coaxial cylinders at zero temperature reminds the London's superconductor. It
exhibits the quantization of trapped flux as well as the Meissner effect.
However, all the phenomena are of a mesoscopic nature. The critical field $H_c$

translated into boson language, the mean square winding number around the rod
for a system of size $R$ perpendicular to the rod reads $<W^2> =
{n_s\hbar^2\over 2\pi mk_BT}\ln(R/a)$. This result is directly applicable to

  Using Artificial Neural Networks","See http://www.jair.org/ for any accompanying files","Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Vol 6, (1997), 35-85",,,"cs.AI",,"  Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have
been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and
symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or
connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use
a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic
component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning
robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a
flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for
analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather
than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist
analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language
processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of
connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the
SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In
this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the
flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer,
and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of
noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat
representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language
than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the
fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a
flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an
overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.

the scalar gravitational waves weakly depends on the rotation parameter of
black hole $a$ and on the azimuthal angle.
  Secondly, using a model of a non-spherical dust shell of test particles
falling into a Kerr black hole, we study when the scalar modes dominate. When a
black hole is rotating, the tensor modes do not vanish even for a ``spherically
symmetric"" shell, instead a slightly oblate shell minimizes their energy but
with non-zero finite value, which depends on Kerr parameter $a$. As a result,
we find that the scalar modes dominate only for highly spherical collapse, but
they never exceed the tensor modes unless the Brans-Dicke parameter
$\omega_{BD} \lsim 750 $ for $a/M=0.99$ or unless $\omega_{BD} \lsim 20,000 $

models related by non Abelian duality transformations. In this respect it is
shown that in the one loop order of perturbation theory the duals of a one
parameter family of models, interpolating between the SU(2) principal model and
the O(3) sigma model, exhibit the same behaviour as the original models. For
the O(3) model also the two loop equivalence is investigated, and is found to
be broken just like in the already known example of the principal model.

scattering data at 68.3 MeV, finding a value for the $S_{31}$ phase shift about
1^o smaller than found in the Karlsruhe-Helsinki (KH) partial-wave analysis.
The authors use this result to argue for a dispersion relation analysis using
recently measured data, so that their effect on the $\pi NN$ coupling constant
(f^2) and $\Sigma$ amplitude can be determined. We note that these tasks were
accomplished prior to the submission of the above paper. We clarify the effect
of this new analyzing power data on f^2 and the $\Sigma$ amplitude.

acceleration at the structured quasi-perpendicular supercritical shock. The
motion of the pickup ions in the shock is studied analytically and numerically
using the test particle analysis in the model shock front. The analysis shows
that slow pickup ions may be accelerated at the shock ramp to high energies.
The maximum ion energy is determined by the fine structure of the
electro-magnetic field at the shock ramp and decreases when the angle between
magnetic field and shock normal decreases. Evolution of pickup ion distribution
across the nearly-perpendicular shock and pickup ion spectrum is also studied
by direct numerical analysis.

directly in the lambda-p calculus. We also demonstrate how satisfiability can
be solved in the lambda-q calculus.

following a sequence of results suggesting that quantum computers are more
powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that
factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in
quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be
efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this
question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with
probability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in
time $o(2^{n/2})$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen
uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class $NP \cap coNP$ cannot be
solved on a quantum Turing machine in time $o(2^{n/3})$. The former bound is
tight since recent work of Grover shows how to accept the class NP relative to
any oracle on a quantum computer in time $O(2^{n/2})$.
