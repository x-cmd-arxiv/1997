requires t^2 serial computation steps or t parallel ones. However, certain CAs
based on an Abelian group, such as addition mod 2, are termed ``linear''
because they obey a principle of superposition. This allows them to be
predicted efficiently, in serial time O(t) or O(log t) in parallel.
  In this paper, we generalize this by looking at CAs with a variety of
algebraic structures, including quasigroups, non-Abelian groups, Steiner
systems, and others. We show that in many cases, an efficient algorithm exists
even though these CAs are not linear in the previous sense; we term them
``quasilinear.'' We find examples which can be predicted in serial time
proportional to t, t log t, t log^2 t, and t^a for a < 2, and parallel time log
t, log t log log t and log^2 t.
  We also discuss what algebraic properties are required or implied by the
existence of scaling relations and principles of superposition, and exhibit
several novel ``vector-valued'' CAs.

such winds, if they exist, do not penetrate into the chromospheric Si

variability decreases with the luminosity. An important part of the scatter in
the relationship may be explained if one tries to estimate the uncertainties on
the variability due to the sampling. We discuss the variability using the
concept of discrete events. The trend between variability and luminosity is
described by a power-law with an index -0.08, which is incompatible with the
power-law of index -1/2 predicted by the most general discrete-event models in
which the change in average luminosity is due to differences in average event
rates exclusively. We conclude that the -1/2 index is definitely inconsistent
with the data. A flat relationship is however possible, if some bias has been
underestimated. We propose different ways whereby discrete events may produce a
different variability--luminosity relationship: by changing the luminosity or
the life time of the events, or by introducing interdependence between the
events. The latter possibility cannot produce a satisfactory relationship.
Using the former possibilities, we do not find any ""natural"" explanation for
the variability- luminosity relationship in the context of discrete-event
models. This is possibly an indication that explanations in which variability
is not expressed in terms of discrete events should be favoured.

the electronic density is such that the Landau level filling fraction $\nu$ in

layers in purely electronic terms, we show that the unique dependence of the
longitudinal conductivity on wave-vector, observed in surface acoustic waves
experiments, leads to a very slow decay of density fluctuations. Consequently,
it has a crucial effect on the Coulomb drag, as manifested in the
transresistivity $\rho_D$. We find that the transresistivity is very large
compared to its typical values at zero magnetic field, and that its temperature
dependence is unique -- $\rho_D \propto T^{4/3}$. For filling factors at or
close to $1/4$ and $3/4$ the transresistivity has the same $T$-dependence, and
is larger than at $\nu = 1/2$. We calculate $\rho_D$ for the $\nu=3/2$ case and
propose that it might shed light on the spin polarization of electrons at
$\nu=3/2$. We compare our results to recent calculations of $\rho_D$ at
$\nu=1/2$ where a composite fermion approach was used and a
$T^{4/3}$-dependence was obtained. We conclude that what appears in the

theory is discussed at low orders in perturbation theory in the background of a
D-instanton. The integration over fermionic zero modes in both the low energy
supergravity and in the string theory leads to explicit nonperturbative terms
in the effective action. These include a single instanton correction to the
known tree-level and one-loop $R^4$ interactions. The `spectrum' of
multiply-charged D-instantons is deduced by T-duality in nine dimensions from
multiply-wound world-lines of marginally-bound D-particles. This, and other
clues, lead to a conjectured SL(2,Z) completion of the $R^4$ terms which
suggests that they are not renormalized by perturbative corrections in the
zero-instanton sector beyond one loop. The string theory unit-charged
D-instanton gives rise to point-like effects in fixed-angle scattering, raising
unresolved issues concerning distance scales in superstring theory.

of phase transition. In some cases, these singularities can be understood in
the framework of the conventional fields theores as the points of enhanced
gauge symmetry. We consider a class of three moduli Type-II strings. It is
shown the periods can be written in the form of hypergeometric series around
the singular points in these models. The leading expansion around the conifold
locus turns out to be described by Appell functions. In one singular point, we
observe the enhanced gauge symmetry of $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ independent of the
models. Around another conifold locus, however, the resulting expression of the
Appell functions depends on the models. We examine the result by considering a
relation between these Appell functions and underlying Riemann surfaces.

plasma within the framework of a simple two-phase model. The analysis is
performed in a system with two conserved charges (baryon number and isospin)
using the stability conditions on the free energy, the conservation laws and
Gibbs' criteria for phase equilibrium. The EOS is obtained in a separate
description for the hadronic phase and for the quark-gluon plasma. For the
hadrons, a relativistic mean-field model calibrated to the properties of
nuclear matter is used, and a bag-model type EOS is used for the quarks and
gluons. The model is applied to the deconfinement phase transition that may
occur in matter created in ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy ions. Based
on the two-dimensional coexistence surface (binodal), various phase separation
scenarios and the Maxwell construction through the mixed phase are discussed.
In the framework of the two-phase model the phase transition in asymmetric
matter is continuous (second-order by Ehrenfest's definition) in contrast to
the discontinuous (first-order) transition of symmetric systems.

particle or worldline representation of relativistic field theory, to study
scattering in the context of the scalar Wick - Cutkosky model. Important
features of the variational calculation are that it is a controlled
approximation scheme valid for arbitrary coupling strengths, the Green
functions have all the cuts and poles expected for the exact result at any
order in perturbation theory and that the variational parameters are
simultaneously sensitive to the infrared as well as the ultraviolet behaviour
of the theory. We generalize the previously used quadratic trial action by
allowing more freedom for off-shell propagation without a change in the
on-shell variational equations and evaluate the scattering amplitude at first
order in the variational scheme. Particular attention is paid to the
$s$-channel scattering near threshold because here non-perturbative effects can
be large. We check the unitarity of a our numerical calculation and find it
greatly improved compared to perturbation theory and to the zeroth order
variational results.

decomposed into a quasidirect product of linear ones. These CAs can be
predicted by parallel circuits of depth O(log^2 t) using gates with binary
inputs, or O(log t) depth if ``sum mod p'' gates with an unbounded number of
inputs are allowed. Thus these CAs can be predicted by (idealized) parallel
computers much faster than by explicit simulation, even though they are
non-linear.
  This class includes any CA whose rule, when written as an algebra, is a
solvable group. We also show that CAs based on nilpotent groups can be
predicted in depth O(log t) or O(1) by circuits with binary or ``sum mod p''
gates respectively.
  We use these techniques to give an efficient algorithm for a CA rule which,
like elementary CA rule 18, has diffusing defects that annihilate in pairs.
This can be used to predict the motion of defects in rule 18 in O(log^2 t)
parallel time.
