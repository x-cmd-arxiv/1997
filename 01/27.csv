  with the VLTI (1997) ed. F. Paresce, (Springer: Heidelberg)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Cosmology with large interferometric telescopes is a rich and largely
unexplored subject, involving three types of measurement: astrometric
measurement of absolute distances and proper motions, dispersions of relative
proper motions, and images. The ground based interferometers can have huge
apertures, which are necessary for faint cosmological targets. But, alone, they
are limited to astrometry within the isoplanatic patch, and hence to relative
positions, which are of little use for parallaxes and proper motions because
reference stars have unknown parallaxes and huge (500 \mu arcsec) unknown
motions. We propose that space missions should measure global astrometric
parallaxes and proper motions for (V > 16) reference stars within the
isoplanatic patches of important cosmological and Galactic targets. Ground
based interferometers can then measure absolute distances (parallaxes) and
proper motions to 10 \mu arcsec, tied to these reference stars. But
cosmological observations stretch the VLTI technically. To observe the few best
targets, we need to be able to measure positions to < 10 \mu arcsec over a
large portion of the sky. Since natural guide stars are too far apart, or too
faint, laser guide stars are needed to correct the wavefronts of the individual
8-m unit telescopes, and the fringe tracking system must have an extremely high
throughput to work on the brightest stars (V > 16) near to important targets.
Most of the science is at 1 --2 microns, where excellent adaptive optics will
be needed on the 8-m telescopes.

study the effects of winds on the binary evolution of CBSSs, and compute the

mean baryon density in the universe which is predicted by the Big Bang

put constraints on $\sigma_8$, the rms linear fluctuation on scales of
$8h^{-1}\Mpc$, and the slope of the fluctuation spectrum, where $h$ is the
Hubble constant in units of 100 $\kms \oMpc$. We find $\sigma_8 = 0.80 \pm

$\sigma_8$ obtained in this study with those from $\Omega_0$-dependent analyses
to date. We find that $\sigma_8(\Omega_0)$ derived from the cluster abundance

$\sigma_8(\Omega_0)$ measured from the peculiar velocity field of galaxies

the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and reported earlier; however the
observations at different telescopes produce different results for width and
optical depth of the line.
  If the detection holds, it provides evidence for a high column density of
neutral gas that is confined to a dynamically cold layer with velocity
dispersion ~10 km/s. Although the interpretation is uncertain due to a lack of
detailed knowledge of the extended radio structure of the background quasar and
the relative quantities of neutral gas in the cold and turbulent components,
the observations specify high spin temperatures, T_s > 1000 K for both this
21cm line absorbing cloud and the turbulent component, which together have N_HI

presence of metal-enriched clouds of still broader velocity dispersion than the

young disk galaxy that is sufficiently evolved by z=3.4 to have collapsed to a
flattened system and produced a population of stars that have aged to pollute a

formation in a merging hierarchy. In this picture, the role of gaseous
processes and dissipation decreased with increasing mass creating
preferentially rotationally flattend disky ellipticals (and S0s) at lower
luminosities and boxy, anisotropic ellipticals (often with peculiar kinematics)
at higher luminosities. However, gas and dissipation processes must have been
important even in the formation of the most luminous ellipticals. They played
key roles in determining the phase space structure of Es and possibly ensured a
tight fundamental plane. The bulk of the stars in the majority of luminous
cluster ellipticals formed at redshifts above two, likely above three. This
follows from their homogenous colors and line strengths and their essentially
passive evolution with redshift. Low luminosity ellipticals (and probably field
ellipticals) may have had extended star formation histories, possibly
associated with the presence of disks. The star-formation time-scales can
presumably be constrained on the basis of abundance ratios and seem to be
inversely related to galaxy mass. Massive ellipticals are likely to have formed

model applies to molecules within bright photodissociation regions in galactic
star-forming regions and starburst galaxies. In such environments, the near
infrared photons emitted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs) or
small carbon grains, 5 micron < lambda < 20 micron, are able to penetrate
molecular regions and pump the molecules in an excited vibration state. The far
infrared and submillimeter transitions involved in the de-excitation cascade
are strongly affected by this process. Their intensities can be enhanced by
several orders of magnitude. We have applied this model to H2O and NH3, ortho
and para species. The behaviour of the FIR rotation lines with respect to the
gas density and the molecule column density is strongly modified compared to
pure collisional models. At moderate densities, nH2 < 10^5 cm-3, radiative
pumping dominates the excitation of the rotation ladder, and the FIR lines are
good probes of the molecule column density. The near infrared absorption and
emission lines predicted to appear between 6 and 7 micron for H2O and from 10
to 12 micron for NH3 can also be used for this purpose. Concerning ortho-H2O, a
quasi resonant pumping of the nu2 6.18 micron transition by photons of the 6.2
micron PAH band occurs. A strong de-excitation emission line is expected at
6.64 micron.

problem for the Pauli-Lubanski vector projection in a direction given by a
world-vector t. As opposed to the standard treatments where t is a constant
time direction, our t is in general p-dependent and timelike, spacelike or
null. The corresponding eigenstates play a role of a basis used to define
Bargmann-Wigner spinors which form a carrier space of the unitary
representation. The construction does not use the Wigner-Mackey induction
procedure, is manifestly covariant and works simultaneously in both massive and
massless cases (in on- and off-shell versions). Of particular interest are
special Bargmann-Wigner spinors ($\omega$-spinors) associated with flag pole
directions of the spin-frame field $\omega_A(p)$.

with particular emphasis to heterotic M(atrix) theory on $S_1/Z_2$ relevant to

orbifold condition on Chan-Paton factors, we show that three choice of gauge
group are possible for heterotic M(atrix) theory: SO(2N), SO(2N+1) or USp(2N).
By examining area-preserving diffeomorphism that underlies the M(atrix) theory,
we find that each choices of gauge group restricts possible topologies of
two-branes. The result suggests that only the choice of SO(2N) or SO(2N+1)
groups allows open two-branes, hence, relevant to heterotic M(atrix) theory. We
show that requirement of both local vacuum energy cancellation and of
worldsheet anomaly cancellation of resulting heterotic string identifies
supersymmetric twisted sector spectra with sixteen fundamental representation
spinors from each of the two fixed points. Twisted open and closed two-brane
configurations are obtained in the large N limit.
