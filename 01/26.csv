conic-bundle over $P^2$ and the Prym variety of a naturally defined \'etale
double cover of the discrminant curve of the conic-bundle. Clemens and
Griffiths used this isomorphism to give a proof of the irrationality of a
smooth cubic threefold and Beauville later generalized the isomorphism to
intermediate jacobians of odd-dimensional quadric-bundles over $P^2$. We
further generalize the isomorphism to the primitive cohomology of a smooth
cubic hypersurface in $P^n$.

"alg-geom/9701014","Donu Arapura","Donu Arapura","Geometry of cohomology support loci II: integrability of Hitchin's map","17 pages, AMS LaTeX",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  In very rough terms, the main theorem is that the set, which consists of
semistable vector bundles with trivial rational Chern classes and nontrivial
kth cohomology on a smooth complex projective variety, is a degeneration of a
union of abelian varieties. More precisely, we consider the subset of the
moduli space of Higgs bundles satisfying the analogous cohomological condition.
We show that this set is Zariski closed and that if Sigma is the normalization
of an irreducible component containing a stable point, then a connected
component of a general fiber of the restriction of the Hitchin map to Sigma is
an abelian variety. This should be interpreted as a nonabelian version of a
theorem of Green and Lazarsfeld. The Hitchin map in this setting is in fact
Simpson's generalization of it. The key point is to show that the general
fibers of this map are lagrangian (where the target of the map is taken to be
the image). This hinges on the fact that this property is essentially
hereditary for hyperkaehler submanifolds. We establish various other properties
of these sets including a codimension estimate which may be viewed as a generic
vanishing theorem.

described. By using a tree threaded at all levels, tree traversals for finding
nearest neighbors are avoided. All operations on a tree including tree
modifications are O(N), where N is a number of cells, and are performed in
parallel. An efficient implementation of the tree is described that requires 2N
words of memory. A filtering algorithm for removing high-frequency noise during
mesh refinement is described.
  A FTT can be used in various numerical applications. In this paper, it is
applied to the integration of the Euler equations of fluid dynamics. An
adaptive-mesh time stepping algorithm is described in which different time
steps are used at different levels of the tree. Time stepping and mesh
refinement are interleaved to avoid extensive buffer layers of fine mesh which
were otherwise required ahead of moving shocks. Test examples are presented,
and the FTT performance is evaluated. The three-dimensional simulation of the
interaction of a shock wave and a spherical bubble is carried out that shows
the development of azimuthal perturbations on the bubble surface.

black hole is strongly wrinkled, with its shape manifesting a self-similar
(``fractal'') spectrum of fluctuations on all scales below the threshold. This
threshold scale is small compared to the radius of the black hole, but still
much larger than the Planck scale. If present, such fluctuations might account
for a large part of the horizon entropy.

by color tube fission are considered. Using the previously obtained expression
for probability of the tube breaking in n points we have calculated the one and
two particle inclusive spectra of tube pieces as well as pseudoscalar and
vector mesons in plateau area. It is shown that the plateau height of the one
particle inclusive spectrum is determined by the flavor quark composition and
spin of hadron. Small oscillations of the tube surface give only small
correction to the main term. The correlation functions of fixed particles have
the form of a product of the universal function that depends only on the
particle rapidity difference and thescale factor dependent on the spin and
flavor quark composition of hadron.
