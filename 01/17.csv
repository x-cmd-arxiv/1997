up showing long-term changes in the frequency derivative dot Omega. This
particular behaviour has been interpreted as evidence for an evolution of the
torque acting upon the star. A variable torque may be related to non-canonical
braking indexes, for which some determinations have been possible. We briefly
analyse in this work the consistency of postulating a growth in the angle
between the magnetic moment and the rotation axis as the cause of such events.
We show that this hypothesis leads to the determination of the initial period,
initial and present angles, according to the assumed angle growth, for young
pulsars whose respective braking indices n_{obs} and jerk parameters m_{obs}

recent observations suggest that the abundance of carbon available for dust in
the interstellar medium is less than half of the amount required to be tied up
in graphite grains in order to explain the interstellar extinction curve.
  This paper presents an detailed assessment of a newly-proposed dust model
(Mathis 1996), in which the majority of the interstellar carbon is contained in
composite and fluffy dust (CFD) grains. Per unit mass, these grains produce
more UV extinction, and can therefore account for the interstellar extinction
curve with about half the carbon required in traditional dust models.
  The results of our analysis show that the CFD model falls short in solving
the carbon crisis, in providing a fit to the UV-optical interstellar extinction
curve. It also predicts a far-infrared emissivity in excess of that observed
with the COBE/DIRBE and FIRAS instruments from the diffuse interstellar medium.
The failure of the new model highlights the interrelationships between the
various dust properties and their observational consequences, and the need to
satisfy them all simultaneously in any comprehensive interstellar dust model.
  In light of these problems, the paper examines other possible solutions to
the carbon crisis.

fairly large image separation as being due to the inclination of a typical
spiral, rather than the presence of a very massive halo. The fairly low
magnification ratio can also be readily understood if the disk is included. We
also discuss how such lensed systems might allow one to constrain parameters of
spiral galaxies such as a disk-to-halo mass ratio, and disk mass scale length.
Another example we consider is the quasar multiple-lensing cross section, which
we find can increase many-fold at high inclination for a typical spiral.
Finally, we discuss the changes in the gravitational lensing effects on damped
Lyman alpha systems (DLAS) when disk lensing is included.

the findings of all previous studies. Useful constraints probably require

population of standard candle bursters and a local population distributed
throughout a standard Bahcall-Soneira dark matter halo with a 2 kpc core. We
find that the purely local models we have studied can account for the 3B data
as successfully as cosmological models, provided one considers halos with core
sizes significantly larger than those used to model the distribution of dark
matter. We infer core sizes for the halo distribution that are smaller than one
might expect based on popular semiquantitative arguments, and show why such
arguments can lead to unwarranted conclusions. We also find that the 3B data do
not constrain the width of power-law luminosity functions for burst sources.
Our analysis of mixed models finds two families of models that can successfully
account for the data: models with up to 20% of observed bursts in a bright
local population visible to ~ 50 kpc; and models with up to 50% of observed
bursts in a dim local population visible only nearby (to less than a disk scale

well be such an example. Djorgovski et al have recently detected the
Lyman-alpha emission from the absorber, which we assume is at the systemic
redshift of the absorbing galaxy. By examining the profiles of the metal
absorption lines arising from the absorbing galaxy in relation to its systemic
redshift, we find strong kinematical evidence for rotation. Therefore the
absorber is likely to be a disk galaxy. The inferred circular velocity for the
galaxy is >200 km/s. With a separation of ~17 kpc between the galaxy and the
quasar sightline, the implied dynamic mass for the galaxy is >1.6x10(11) solar
mass. The metallicity of the galaxy is found to be [Fe/H]=-1.4, typical of
damped Lyman-alpha galaxies at such redshifts. However, in another damped
galactic rotation is evident. In the latter case, the damped Lyman-alpha
absorber occurs near the background quasar in redshift so its properties may be
influenced by the background quasar. These represent the only two cases at
present for which the technique used here may be applied. Future applications
of the same technique to a large sample of damped Lyman-alpha galaxies may
allow us to determine if a significant population of disk galaxies already
existed only a few billion years after the Big Bang.

bi-directional, head-driven parser for constraint-based grammars. This parser
is developed for the OVIS system: a Dutch spoken dialogue system in which
information about public transport can be obtained by telephone.
  After a review of the motivation for head-driven parsing strategies, and
head-corner parsing in particular, a non-deterministic version of the
head-corner parser is presented. A memoization technique is applied to obtain a
fast parser. A goal-weakening technique is introduced which greatly improves
average case efficiency, both in terms of speed and space requirements.
  I argue in favor of such a memoization strategy with goal-weakening in
comparison with ordinary chart-parsers because such a strategy can be applied
selectively and therefore enormously reduces the space requirements of the
parser, while no practical loss in time-efficiency is observed. On the
contrary, experiments are described in which head-corner and left-corner
parsers implemented with selective memoization and goal weakening outperform
`standard' chart parsers. The experiments include the grammar of the OVIS
system and the Alvey NL Tools grammar.
  Head-corner parsing is a mix of bottom-up and top-down processing. Certain
approaches towards robust parsing require purely bottom-up processing.
Therefore, it seems that head-corner parsing is unsuitable for such robust
parsing techniques. However, it is shown how underspecification (which arises
very naturally in a logic programming environment) can be used in the
head-corner parser to allow such robust parsing techniques. A particular robust
parsing model is described which is implemented in OVIS.

parameters, the number of wires ($2N$) and the flux per unit strip ($\alpha$);
in the limit $N \to \infty$ and fixed $\alpha \ll 1$ the dynamics of the model
are described by the set of coupled integral equations, which coincide with
those for the $p=4$ disordered spherical model. Below the glass transition we
have solved these equations numerically in a number of different regimes. We
observe power-law ageing after a fast quench with an exponent that decreases
rapidly with temperature. After slow cooling to a not-too-low temperature, we
see ageing characterized by the appearance of a new time scale which has a
power law dependence on the cooling rate. By contrast if the array is cooled
slowly to very low temperatures the ageing disappears. The physical
consequences of these results in different cooling regimes are discussed for
future experiment. We also study the structure of the phase space in the low
temperature glassy regime. Analytically we expect an exponential number of
metastable states just below the glass transition temperature with vanishing
mutual overlap, and numerical results indicate that this scenario remains valid
down to zero temperature. Thus in this array there is no further subdivision of
metastable states. We also investigate the probability to evolve to different
states given a starting overlap, and our results suggest a broad distribution
of barriers.

solar masses; LISA can do high SNR (of order 10^4) high accuracy studies in the
mass range of about 10^5 to 10^8 solar masses. BBHs might well be the first
sources detected by LIGO/VIRGO: they are visible to much larger distances (up
to 500 Mpc by initial interferometers) than coalescing neutron star binaries
(heretofore regarded as the ""bread and butter"" workhorse source for LIGO/VIRGO,
visible to about 30 Mpc by initial interferometers). Low-mass BBHs (up to 50
solar masses for initial LIGO interferometers; 100 for advanced; 10^6 for LISA)
are best searched for via their well-understood inspiral waves; higher mass
BBHs must be searched for via their poorly understood merger waves and/or their
well-understood ringdown waves. A matched filtering search for massive BBHs
based on ringdown waves should be capable of finding BBHs in the mass range of
about 100 to 700 solar masses out to 200 Mpc (initial LIGO interferometers),
and 200 to 3000 solar masses out to about z=1 (advanced interferometers). The
required number of templates is of order 6000 or less. Searches based on merger
waves could increase the number of detected massive BBHs by a factor of order
10 or more over those found from inspiral and ringdown waves, without detailed
knowledge of the waveform shapes, using a ""noise monitoring"" search algorithm.
A full set of merger templates from numerical relativity could further increase
the number of detected BBHs by an additional factor of up to 4.

By constructing the unique S-duality invariant field perturbations for the

the axion field is time-dependent as well as in a dilaton-vacuum cosmology.
Whereas the dilaton and moduli fields have steep blue perturbation spectra
(with spectral index n=4) we find that the axion spectrum depends upon the
expansion rate of the internal dimensions (0.54<n<4) which allows
scale-invariant (n=1) spectra. We note that for n<1 the metric is non-singular
in the conformal frame in which the axion is minimally coupled.

resonances is discussed. It is shown that, in general, the mass distribution of
resonance decay products has a two-component structure corresponding to decay
outside and inside the nucleus. The first (narrow) component of the amplitude
has a Breit-Wigner form determined by the vacuum values of mass and width of
the resonance. The second (broad) component corresponds to interactions of the
resonance with the nuclear medium. It can be also described by a Breit-Wigner
shape with parameters depending e.g. on the nuclear density and on the cross
section of the resonance-nucleon interaction. The resonance production is
examined both at intermediate energies, where interactions with the nucleus can
be considered as a series of successive local rescatterings, and at high
energies, $E>E_{crit}$, where a change of interaction picture occurs. This
change of mechanisms of the interactions with the nucleus is typical for the
description within the Regge theory approach and is connected with the nonlocal
nature of the reggeon interaction.

parameterized in terms of Cassini ovaloids are extended to collective dynamics
at finite excitations. Taking fission as the most demanding example of large
scale collective motion, transport coefficients are evaluated along a fission
path. We concentrate on those for average motion, namely stiffness C, friction
\gamma and inertia M. Their expressions are formulated within a locally
harmonic approximation and the help of linear response theory. Different
approximations are examined and comparisons are made both with previous
studies, which involved different descriptions of single particle dynamics, as
well as with macroscopic models. Special attention is paid to an appropriate
definition of the deformation of the nuclear density and its relation to that
of the single particle potential. For temperatures above 3 MeV the inertia
agrees with that of irrotational flow to less than a factor of two, but shows
larger deviations below, in particular in its dependence on the shape. Also
friction exhibits large fluctuations along the fission path for small
excitations. They get smoothed out above 3 - 4 MeV where \gamma attains values
in the range of the wall formula. For T > (or=) 2 MeV the inverse relaxation
time \beta = \gamma /M turns out to be rather insensitive to the shape and
increases with T.
