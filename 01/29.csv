hydro calculations for such events require an accurate prediction of the
thermonuclear energy generation, while avoiding full nucleosynthesis network
calculations. In the present investigation we present an approximation scheme
applicable in a temperature range which covers the whole range of all presently
known astrophysical sites. It is based on the concept of slowly varying
hydrogen and helium abundances and assumes a kind of local steady flow by
requiring that all reactions entering and leaving a nucleus add up to a zero
flux. This scheme can adapt itself automatically and covers situations at low
temperatures, characterized by a steady flow of reactions, as well as high
temperature regimes where a $(p,\gamma)-(\gamma,p)$-equilibrium is established.
In addition to a gain of a factor of 15 in computational speed over a full
network calculation, and an energy generation accurate to more than 15 %, this
scheme also allows to predict correctly individual isotopic abundances. Thus,
it delivers all features of a full network at a highly reduced cost and can
easily be implemented in hydro calculations.

subsamples of the catalogue, ranging from $cz=3000$ km/s to $cz=28000$ km/s.
Our substructure detection method is based on the wavelet transform and on the
segmentation analysis. The wavelet transform allows us to find out structures
at different scales and the segmentation method allows us a quantitative
statistical and morphological analysis of the sample. From the whole catalogue
we select a subset of 320 galaxies, with redshifts between cz=5858 km/s and
cz=8168 km/s that we identify as belonging to the central region of Coma and on
which we have performed a deeper analysis, on scales ranging from $180 h^{-1}$
kpc to $1.44 h^{-1}$ Mpc. Our results are expressed in terms of the number of
structures or voids and their sphericity for different values of the threshold
detection and at all the scales investigated. According to our analysis, there
is strong evidence for multiple hierarchical substructure, on scales ranging
from a few hundreds of kpc to about $4 h^{-1}$ Mpc. The morphology of these
substructures is rather spherical. On the scale of $720 h^{-1}$ kpc we find two
main subclusters which where also found before, but our wavelet analysis shows

observed in experiments. The dimensions are not universal and depend on
density. Our observations are applicable to spatial, temporal and spectral
random structures, all with non-zero measure. Fat fractal analysis does not
seem to add information over routine fractal analysis procedures. Most
significantly, we find that this apparent fractal behavior is robust even to
the presence of moderate correlations. We thus propose that apparent fractal
behavior observed experimentally over a limited range in some systems, may
often have its origin in underlying randomness.

transition between them. In the AF phase near the quantum critical point (QCP)
we find both spin waves and a low-lying but massive amplitude mode which is
absent in a conventional AF. The static susceptibility has the form $\chi(T) =

the dynamical properties to examine novel features due to the presence of the

the gap in the amplitude mode. The dynamical properties unique to near-critical

due to the large size mismatch between Ni and Au, which makes the effects of
atomic relaxation critical, and also the fact that Ni-Au exhibits a phase
separation tendency at low temperatures, but measurements at high-temperature
show an ordering-type short-range order. We have clarified the wide disparity
which exists in the previously calculated values of mixing energies and
thermodynamic properties by computing ``state-of-the-art'' energetics
(full-potential, fully-relaxed LDA total energies) combined with
``state-of-the-art'' statistics (k-space cluster expansion with Monte Carlo
simulations) for the Ni-Au system. We find: (i) LDA provides accurate mixing
energies of disordered Ni_{1-x}Au_x alloys (\Delta H_{mix} < +100 meV/atom)
provided that both atomic relaxation (a ~100 meV/atom effect) and short-range
order (~25 meV/atom) are taken into account properly. (ii) Previous studies
using empirical potentials or approximated LDA methods often underestimate the
formation energy of ordered compounds, and hence also underestimate the mixing
energy of random alloys. (iii) Measured values of the total entropy of mixing
combined with calculated values of the configurational entropy demonstrate that
the non-configurational entropy in Ni-Au is large, and leads to a significant
reduction in miscibillity gap temperature. (iv) The calculated short-range
order agrees well with measurements, and both predict ordering in the
disordered phase. (v) Consequently, using inverse Monte Carlo to extract
interaction energies from the measured/calculated short-range order in Ni-Au
would result in interactions which would produce ordering-type mixing energies,
in contradiction with both experimental measurements and precise LDA energies.

be exploited for precision tests on the properties of the massive gauge bosons.
The connection between the probing of the symmetry breaking sector and precise
measurement of the self-couplings of the weak vector bosons is stressed. The
discussion relies much on the impact of the present low-energy data, especially
LEP1. These have restricted some paths that lead to the exploration of the
scalar sector through the investigation of the so-called anomalous couplings of
the W's and suggest a hierarchy in the classification of these parameters. The
limits we expect to set on these couplings at the different modes of the linear
colliders are reviewed and compared with those one obtains at the LHC. The
conclusion is that the first phase of a linear collider running at 500 GeV and
the LHC are complementary. Some important issues concerning radiative
corrections and backgrounds that need further studies in order that one
conducts high precision analyses at high energies are discussed.

BFT Hamiltonian method is applied in order to systematically convert a second
class constraint system of the model into an effectively first class one by
introducing new fields. In finding the involutive Hamiltonian we adopt a new
approach which is more simpler than the usual one. We also show that in our
model the Dirac brackets of the phase space variables in the original second
class constraint system are exactly the same as the Poisson brackets of the
corresponding modified fields in the extended phase space due to the linear
character of the constraints comparing the Dirac or Faddeev-Jackiw formalisms.
Then, according to the BFV formalism we obtain that the desired resulting
Lagrangian preserving BRST symmetry in the standard local gauge fixing
procedure naturally includes the St\""uckelberg scalar related to the explicit
gauge symmetry breaking effect due to the presence of the mass term. We also
analyze the nonstandard nonlocal gauge fixing procedure.

compact islands and (c) fractal submonolayers. The implications of the results
to experimental studies of He scattering from disordered surfaces are
discussed, and a combined experimental-theoretical study is made for Ag
submonolayers on Pt(111). Some of the main theoretical findings are: (1)
Structural aspects of the calculated intensities from translationally random
clusters were found to be strongly correlated with those of individual
clusters. (2) Low intensity Bragg interference peaks appear even for scattering
from very small ad-islands, and contain information on the ad-island local
electron structure. (3) For fractal islands, just as for islands with a
different structure, the off-specular intensity depends on the parameters of
the He/Ag interaction, and does not follow a universal power law as previously
proposed in the literature. In the experimental-theoretical study of Ag on
Pt(111), we use first experimental He scattering data from low-coverage (single
adsorbate) systems to determine an empirical He/Ag-Pt potential of good
quality. Then, we carry out He scattering calculations for high coverage and
compare with experiments. The conclusions are that the actual experimental
phase corresponds to small compact Ag clusters of narrow size distribution,
translationally disordered on the surface.
