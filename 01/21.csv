differences in colour are smaller than 5%. Between the two 'island state' data

mass accretion rate the fractional rms amplitude of the power-law shaped power
spectral component that dominates the power spectra below ~1 Hz rises, while
the band-limited noise component at higher frequencies drops. The cut-off

conceptually important to investigate the quality of semiclassical methods as a
function of the dimensionality. As a model system, we choose various three
dimensional generalizations of the famous three disk problem which played a
central role in the study of chaotic scattering in two dimensions. We present a
quantum-mechanical treatment of the hyperbolic scattering of a point particle
off a finite number of non-overlapping and non-touching hard spheres in three
dimensions. We derive expressions for the scattering matrix S and its
determinant. The determinant of S decomposes into two parts, the first one
contains the product of the determinants of the individual one-sphere
S-matrices and the second one is given by a ratio involving the determinants of
a characteristic KKR-type matrix and its conjugate. We justify our approach by
showing that all formal manipulations in these derivations are correct and that
all the determinants involved which are of infinite dimension exist. Moreover,
for all complex wave numbers, we conjecture a direct link between the
quantum-mechanical and semiclassical descriptions: The semiclassical limit of
the cumulant expansion of the KKR-type matrix is given by the Gutzwiller-Voros
zeta function plus diffractional corrections in the curvature expansion. This
connection is direct since it is not based on any kind of subtraction scheme

fragmentation region. It is expected that the tagging of specific particles in
the target fragments can be employed to introduce a bias in the hard scattering
process towards a specific flavour content. The case of hadrons containing a
heavy quark is particularly attractive because of the clear experimental
signatures and the applicability of perturbative QCD. The standard approach to
one-particle inclusive processes based on fragmentation functions is valid in
the current fragmentation region and for large transverse momenta $p_T$ in the
target fragmentation region, but it fails for particle production at small
$p_T$ in the target fragmentation region. A collinear singularity, which cannot
be absorbed in the standard way into the phenomenological distribution
functions, prohibits the application of this procedure. This situation is
remedied by the introduction of a new set of distribution functions, the target
fragmentation functions. They describe particle production in the target
fragmentation region, and can be viewed as correlated distribution functions in
the momentum fractions of the observed particle and of the parton initiating
the hard scattering process. It is shown in a next-to-leading-order calculation
for the case of deeply inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering that the additional
singularity can be consistently absorbed into the renormalized target
fragmentation functions on the one-loop level. The formalism is derived in
detail and is applied to the production of heavy quarks. The renormalization
group equation of the target fragmentation functions for the perturbative
contribution is solved numerically, and the results of a case study for deeply
inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering at DESY (H1 and ZEUS at HERA), at CERN

soliton solutions is the existence of some special ``vacuum solutions'' such
that the Lax operators evaluated on them, lie in some abelian subalgebra of the
associated Kac-Moody algebra. The soliton solutions are constructed out of
those ``vacuum solitons'' by the dressing transformation procedure.
