strong, narrow maser lines were found in DR21(OH), DR21-W, OMC-2, M8E, NGC2264,

of methanol-E at 36 and 84 GHz, and in transitions of methanol-A at 44 and 95
GHz. All these are Class I transitions, and the new masers also belong to Class
I. In two other methanol transitions near 133 GHz, 5(-2)-6(-1)E and
6(2)-7(1)A+, only thermal emission was detected in some sources. Several other
sources with wider lines in the transition 6(-1)-5(0)E also may be masers,
since they do not show any emission at the two other methanol transitons near
133 GHz. These are NGC2071, S231, S255, GGD27, also known as Class I masers.
The ratio of intensities and line widths of the 133 GHz masers and 44 GHz
masers is consistent with the saturated maser model, in which the line
rebroadening with respect to unsaturated masers is suppressed by cross
relaxation due to elastic collisions.

  in proceedings of ESO VLT Workshop on Galaxy Scaling Relations (eds. da Costa
  et al., Springer)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The correlation between the Mg absorption index and the velocity dispersion
(sigma) of local elliptical galaxies is very tight. Because the Mg absorption
depends on both metallicity and age of the underlying stellar population the
observed Mg-sigma relation constrains the possible variation in metallicity and
age for a given velocity dispersion. For a time interval with no change in
metallicity any variation of the Mg index is caused only by the aging of the
stars.
  We have measured the Mg absorption and velocity dispersion of ellipticals in
three clusters at a redshift of z=0.37 and established their Mg-sigma relation.
For any given sigma, the measured Mg absorption is weaker than the mean value
for local ellipticals. Since the evolution of bright cluster ellipticals
between z=0.4 and today is most probably only `passive' this reduction in Mg
can be attributed solely to the younger age of the stellar population. The
small weakening of the Mg absorption of the distant galaxies compared to the
local values implies that most of the stars in cluster ellipticals must have
formed at high redshifts (z_f > 2...4).
  The Mg-sigma test is a very robust method to investigate the evolution of
elliptical galaxies and has several advantages over traditional methods using
luminosities. A remaining problem is the aperture correction necessary to
calibrate observations of galaxies at different distances. Here, we show that
our general conclusions about the epoch of formation still hold when aperture
corrections are calculated assuming a dependence of the radial gradient of
sigma on the galaxy's effective radius rather than assuming no dependence as
was done in all previous studies.

wavelength shifts of the cyclotron lines from the main accretion pole which is

cyclotron lines from the secondary pole appears likely. Compared to 1984, the
cyclotron lines from the main pole appeared redshifted in 1989, during an
episode of higher system brightness. This shift can be explained assuming
either different locations of the accretion spot and, hence, variations of the
magnetic field, or variations of the plasma temperature both triggered by
variations of the mass accretion rate. The cyclotron lines from the second pole
do not show such changes suggesting that the coupling region for the weakly
accreting pole is more or less stationary whereas the coupling region of the

different beaming behaviour which might change on timescales as short as one or
several orbital periods. Optical light curve modelling was used to estimate the

significant contributions from the UV-illuminated hemisphere of the companion
star, whereas the HeII4686 emission originates predominantly from the accretion
stream. The emission lines have a multi-component structure and we could single
out a narrow emission line in the Hbeta and Hgamma lines. Its radial velocity

infalling into the nucleus, and that the large central velocity gradient is due
to a central dark mass (in the range 7~$10^7$--$10^8$~\Msun), we obtain a
reasonably good fit to the observations. However, if this cluster lies in the
central 20 pc, we estimate the life-time of the cluster to be less than

formulae, and is essentially due to the deformation of the stellar cluster
through the huge tidal forces provided by the black hole. We show that the

the diffusive process at scale $\delta$. When $\delta$ is small compared with
the typical length of the velocity field one has $\tau(\delta) \sim
\lambda^{-1}$, where $\lambda$ is the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the
Lagrangian motion. At large $\delta$ the behavior of $\tau(\delta)$ depends on
the details of the system, in particular the presence of boundaries, and in
this limit we have found a universal behavior for a large class of system under
rather general hypothesis.
  The method of working at fixed scale $\delta$ makes more physical sense than
the traditional way of looking at the relative diffusion at fixed delay times.
