  for publication in A&A Letters",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We report on a deep search with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope
towards the galactic anticenter for the 327 MHz hyperfine transition of DI.
This is a favorable direction for a search because: (i) the HI optical depth is
high due to velocity crowding; (ii) the observed molecular column density is
low (implying that most of the deuterium would probably be in atomic form,
rather than in HD); and (iii) the stellar reprocessing should be minimal.
  Our observations are about a factor of two more sensitive than previous
searches for DI in this direction. We detect a low significance (about 4 sigma)
feature, consistent in both amplitude and center frequency with an emission
feature reported previously (Blitz & Heiles 1987). If this is the DI line, then
the implied N_D/N_H of 3.9+/-1.0 x 10^-5 is comparable to the inferred
pre-solar deuterium abundance. Our observation is consistent with the recent
low measurements of D/H towards high-redshift Lyman-limit systems. On the other
hand, if the reports of high DI abundance (about 24 x 10^-5) in such systems
are confirmed, then our observations imply that even in regions of reduced star
formation within the outer Galaxy, the DI abundance has been reduced by a
factor of about 6 from the primordial abundance.

  instabilities","13 pages, AASTEX LATEX, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical
  Journal",,"10.1086/304202",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the stability of clouds surrounded by a hotter confining medium
with respect to which they are in motion, against Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities (KHI). In the presence of cooling, sound waves are damped by
dissipation. Whenever cooling times are shorter than sound crossing times, as
they are in the normal interstellar medium, this implies that the instability
generated at the interface of the two media cannot propagate far from the
interface itself. To study how this influences the overall stability, first we
derive an analytic dispersion relation for cooling media, separated by a shear
layer. The inclusion of dissipation does not heal the instability, but it is
shown that only a small volume around the interface is affected, the
perturbation decaying exponentially with distance from the surface; this is
confirmed by numerical simulations. Numerical simulations of spherical clouds
moving in a surrounding intercloud medium by which they are pressure confined
show that these clouds develop a core/halo structure, with a turbulent halo,
and a core in laminar flow nearly unscathed by the KHI. The related and
previously reported ``champagne effect'', whereby clouds seem to explode from
their top sides, is cured by the inclusion of radiative losses.

quantization of simple quantum mechanical models by comparing models with and
without a Gribov problem. We show that the hermiticity and nilpotency of the
BRST charge together with the Batalin-Vilkovisky theorem yield non-trivial
supplementary conditions on gauge fixing fermions. If the gauge fixing fermion
satisfies the supplementary conditions, the BRST physical states form a space
isomorphic to the Dirac space, and the BRST formal path integral does not
suffer from the Gribov problem. The conventional gauge fixing fermion, that
gives rise to the Faddeev-Popov integral, fails to satisfy the supplementary
conditions due to the Gribov problem. Alternatively, enforcing the conventional
gauge fixing fermion, these supplementary conditions imply restrictions on the
BRST physical states for which the Batalin-Vilkovisky theorem holds. We find
that these BRST physical states are not isomorphic the Dirac states. This can
be interpreted as a violation of the Batalin-Vilkovisky theorem on the space of
Dirac states and implies a breakdown of unitarity and a general dependence of
physical quantities on the gauge condition.

holes in 4 dimensions. I restrict myself on axion-free solutions that can
classically be related to intersections of isotropic $D$- or $M$-branes. After
reviewing of some classical properties I include corrections coming from a
general cubic prepotential. On the heterotic side these are quantum corrections
for these black hole solutions. Finally, I discuss a microscopic interpretation
of the entropy for the extremal as well as near-extremal black hole.

application of solvable Lie algebras to the discussion of BPS states in
maximally extended supergravities is outlined.

constructed system of electron (positron) bunches, moving in cold plasma,with
definite density. These combined bunch systems do not generate the wake fields
behind them and can pass through the plasma column in a periodic sequence. The
consideration is carried out numericaly and analyticaly in one dimensional
approach, (which can be applied to finite system when its transverse dimensions
are larger than plasma wave length, divided by $2\pi$). The possibilities of
the experimental tests by measuring the predicted energy gain are discussed on
the examples of Argonne Wakefield Accelerator and induction linac with typical
parameters.

property for the vector space $P(M,V) \oplus P(N,V)$ for any values of the

A family of algebras is also constructed, extending this particular algebra by
$\Delta -1$ arbitrary complex parameters.
