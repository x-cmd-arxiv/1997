connection in the case of rank 2 bundles with trivial determinant over curves
of genus 2. We recall the definition of this connection (which arose in Quantum
Field Theory) and characterize it for families of genus two curves. We then
consider a particular family (over a configuration space), the corresponding
vector bundles are (almost) trivial. The Heat equations which give the
connection these bundles are related to the Lie algebra so(6). We compute some
local monodromy representations. As a byproduct we obtain, for any
representation space V of so(2g+2), a flat connection on the trivial bundle
with fiber V over a configuration space and thus a monodromy representation of
a pure braid group.

  M. Eracleous, A. Koratkar, C. Leitherer, and L. Ho, 70",,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the results of ASCA observations of a heterogenous sample of 15
spiral galaxies. 8 are LINERs or low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN), 5 are starburst
galaxies and 2 are normal spiral galaxies. We find that in all cases the ASCA
spectra can be described by a canonical model consisting of a power-law with a
photon index ~ 1.7-2.0, plus a soft optically thin emission component with kT ~
0.6-0.8 keV. The implied element abundances are often sub-solar. The soft
component is usually extended and the nuclear, point-like emission is sometimes
absorbed by column densities in the range log nH ~ 21-23 cm-2. The relative
luminosities of the soft and hard components vary from galaxy to galaxy. For
the LINERs, the 2-10 keV luminosity of the hard component is typically log L ~
40-41 ergs/s whereas the 0.5-2.0 keV luminosity of the soft component is
typically log L ~ 39-40 ergs/s. For starbursts, the 2-10 keV luminosity of is
log L ~ 39-40 ergs/s, somewhat lower than the corresponding luminosity of most
of the LINERs in our sample. The hard component is similar to the observed
X-ray spectra of quasars and also to the intrinsic X-ray spectra of classical
Seyfert galaxies. Most of the galaxies in our sample exhibit no significant
(dI/I > 20%) short-term variability (with timescales of a day or less) whereas
long-term variability is common. We present a case study of the LINER M81 in
detail where there is evidence of large-amplitude (dI/I ~ 70%) variability over
several weeks. There is also clear evidence for a broad, complex Fe-K emission
line which is compatible with an origin in an accretion disk viewed at ~ 40
deg. These results suggest a strong connection between classical AGN, LINERs,
and starburst galaxies.
