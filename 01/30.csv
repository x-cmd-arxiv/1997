the progenitors of present-day disk galaxies. We examine the probability for
microlensing of background quasars by stars in their DLAs. Microlensing by an
individual star should magnify the continuum but not the broad emission lines
of the quasars. Consequently, the equivalent width distribution of microlensed
quasars would be distorted. We model a representative spiral galaxy as a closed
system composed of a bulge, a disk, and a halo, and evolve the mass fraction of
stars in the disk based on the observed metallicity of DLAs at high redshifts.
The microlensing signatures are stronger if the halo of the galaxy is made of
Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). In this case, the distortion imprinted
by microlensing on the equivalent width distribution of quasar emission lines
can be detected with high significance in a sample of about 10 DLAs with HI
column densities N>10^21 cm^-2 and absorption redshifts z_abs<1. About a tenth
of all quasars with DLAs (N>10^20 cm^-2) might show excess variability on
timescales shorter than five years. A search for these signals would complement
microlensing searches in local galaxies and calibrate the MACHO mass fraction
in galactic halos at high redshifts.

degeneracy on a torus, may be deduced from this conformal field theory. The

excitation in the quantum Hall state. We argue that the edge theory is the

theory of the bulk. This theory is reformulated as a truncated version of a
doublet of Dirac fermions in which the $SU(2)$ symmetry -- which corresponds to

addressing the issue of the fraction of length in infinite strings. We make two
improvements over previous simulations: we include a non-zero random background
field in our box to simulate the effect of long-wavelength modes, and we
examine the effects of smoothing the field on small scales. The inclusion of
the background field significantly reduces the fraction of length in infinite
strings for $n < -2$. Our results are consistent with the possibility that
infinite strings disappear at some $n = n_c$ in the range $-3 \le n_c < -2.2$,
although we cannot rule out $n_c = -3$, in which case infinite strings would
disappear only at the point where the mean string density goes to zero. We
present an analytic argument which suggests the latter case. Smoothing on small
scales eliminates closed loops on the order of the lattice cell size and leads
to a ``lattice-free"" estimate of the infinite string fraction. As expected,
this fraction depends on the type of window function used for smoothing.

point the dimensionally-reduced maximal supergravity theories, with certain
field strengths dualised such that the classical theory exhibits a global
$E_{n(n)}$ symmetry, where n=11-D in D dimensions. A discrete subgroup then
becomes the conjectured U-duality group. In dimensions D\le 6, these necessary
dualisations include NS-NS fields, whose potentials, rather than merely their
field strengths, appear explicitly in the couplings to the string worldsheet.
Thus the usually-stated U-duality symmetries act non-locally on the fundamental
fields of perturbative string theory. At least at the perturbative level, it
seems to be more appropriate to consider the symmetries of the versions of the
lower-dimensional supergravities in which no dualisations of NS-NS fields are
required, although dualisations of the R-R fields are permissible since these
couple to the string through their field strengths. Taking this viewpoint, the
usual T-duality groups survive unscathed, as one would hope since T-duality is
a perturbative symmetry, but the U-duality groups are modified in D\le 6.

natural starting point is a $\sigma$-model with N=4 world sheet supersymmetry.
Remarkably, we find that (owing to the fact that N=4 models with torsion are
not off-shell finite as quantum theories),the T-duality transformations for
these models get in general quantum corrections, with the only known exception
of warped products of flat submanifolds or orbifolds thereof with other
geometries.

quantum gravity, based on a generalisation of the Wigner equation, is proposed.
Our definition for a Wigner equation differs from what have otherwise been
proposed, and does not imply any approximations. It is a completely exact
equation, fully equivalent to the Heisenberg equations of motion. The approach
makes different approximation schemes possible, e.g. it is possible to perform
a systematic calculation of the quantum effects order by order. An iterative
scheme for this is also proposed. The method is illustrated with some simple
examples and applications. A calculation of the trace of the renormalised
energy-momentum tensor is done, and the conformal anomaly is thereby related to
non-conservation of a current in d=2 dimensions and a relationship between a
vector and an axial-vector current in d=4 dimensions.
  The corresponding ``hydrodynamic equations'' governing the evolution of
macroscopic quantities are derived by taking appropriate moments. The emphasis
is put on the spin-1/2 case, but it is shown how to extend to arbitrary spins.
Gravity is treated first in the Palatini formalism, which is not very
tractable, and then more successfully in the Ashtekar formalism, where the
constraints lead to infinite order differential equations for the Wigner
functions.

nuclear matter is described. As nucleon-nucleon interaction the one-boson
exchange potentials Bonn A,B,C and for comparison the Walecka model are used.
The T-matrix is determined from the Thompson equation and is projected onto
five covariant amplitudes. By the restriction to positive energy states an
ambiguity arises in the relativistic Brueckner approach which is discussed here
in terms of the pseudo-scalar and the pseudo-vector projection. The influence
of the coupling of the nucleon via the T-matrix as an effective two-nucleon
interaction to the nuclear medium is expressed by the self-energy. In
particular we investigate the scalar and vector components of the self-energy
for the different one-boson exchange potentials and discuss their density and
momentum dependence. We estimate the uncertainty of the self-energy due to the
pseudo-scalar and the pseudo-vector choice. Usually the momentum dependence of
the self-energy is thought to be weak, however, we find that this depends on
the one-boson exchange potentials. For the Bonn potentials, in contrast to the
$\sigma\omega$-potential, the momentum dependence is strikingly strong above as
well as below the Fermi surface. We compare with the results of other groups
and study the effects on the equation of state and the nucleon optical
potential.

coefficients in deep South Pole ice. The method uses transit time distributions
of pulses from a variable-frequency laser sent between emitters and receivers
embedded in the ice. At depths of 800 to 1000 m scattering is dominated by
residual air bubbles, whereas absorption occurs both in ice itself and in
insoluble impurities. The absorption coefficient increases approximately
exponentially with wavelength in the measured interval 410 to 610 nm. At the
shortest wavelength our value is about a factor 20 below previous values
obtained for laboratory ice and lake ice; with increasing wavelength the
discrepancy with previous measurements decreases. At around 415 to 500 nm the
experimental uncertainties are small enough for us to resolve an extrinsic
contribution to absorption in ice: submicron dust particles contribute by an
amount that increases with depth and corresponds well with the expected
increase seen near the Last Glacial Maximum in Vostok and Dome C ice cores. The
laser pulse method allows remote mapping of gross structure in dust
concentration as a function of depth in glacial ice.
