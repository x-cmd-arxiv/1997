response to include infectious virus and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (cellular
response). The response of the system to virus involves a competition between
the ability of the virus to kill the host cells and the host's ability to
eliminate the virus. We find two basins of attraction in the dynamics of this
system, one is identified with disease and the other with the immune state.
There is also an oscillating state that exists on the border of these two
stable states. Fluctuations in the population of virus or antibody can end the
oscillation and drive the system into one of the stable states. The
introduction of mechanisms of cross-regulation between the two responses can
bias the system towards one of them. We also study a mean field model, based on
coupled maps, to investigate virus-like infections. This simple model
reproduces the attractors for average populations observed in the cellular
automaton. All the dynamical behavior connected to spatial extension is lost,
as is the oscillating feature. Thus the mean field approximation introduced
with coupled maps destroys oscillations.

The conductivity describing the response to the solenoidal field is limited by
the momentum relaxation, like in a normal metal. The response to the potential

The damping of plasma oscillations of superconducting electrons is determined
by dielectric relaxation and is small. Relaxation of branch imbalance
determined by elastic scattering is large enough to make the Carlson-Goldman

space-like Killing vector fields, orthogonal to a surface, containing two
one-parametric families of light-like curves. The condition of the Ricci tensor
to be zero gives Ernst equations for the metric. We write explicitly a family
of local solutions of this equations corresponding to arbitrary initial data on
two characteristics in terms of a series. These metrics describe scattering of
2 gravitational waves, and thus we expect they are very interesting. Ernst
equations can be written as equations of motion for some 2D Lagrangian, which
governs fluctuations of the metric, constant in the Killing directions. This
Lagrangian looks essentially as a 2D chiral field model, and thus is possibly
treatable in the quantum case by standart methods. It is conceivable that it
may describe physics of some specially arranged scattering experiment, thus
giving an insight for 4D gravity, not treatable by standart quantum field
theory methods. The renormalization flow for our Lagrangian is different from
the flow for the unitary chiral field model, the difference is essentially due
to the fact that here the field is taking values in a non-compact space of
symmetric matrices. We investigate the model and derive the renormalized action
in one loop.

nucleus that takes into account large-amplitude quadrupole fluctuations are
discussed. Particular attention is paid to the effect angular-momentum
projection has on the observables associated with the $\gamma$-decay of the
giant-dipole resonance (GDR). We also elaborate on which of the different
projection methods provides the best overall description of the GDR, including
angular distributions. The main consequence of angular-momentum projection is
the appearance of an effective volume element in the integrals associated with
the thermal average of the physical observables. This effective volume element
is controlled by the value of the moments of inertia of the system. In the
limit of rigid-body moments of inertia, the effective volume element is found
to differ only slightly from the volume element associated with the
normalization of the five-dimensional quadrupole oscillator wavefunction in the
$\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\Omega$ space, namely $D[\alpha]=\beta^4d\beta
sin(3\gamma)d\gamma d\Omega$. In the limit of irrotational flow moments of
inertia, the leading behavior in the $\beta$ degree of freedom is
$D[\alpha]\propto \beta d\beta$.
