  appear in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/303552",,"astro-ph",,"  We propose a method to determine the cosmic mass density Omega from
redshift-space distortions induced by large-scale flows in the presence of
nonlinear clustering. Nonlinear structures in redshift space such as fingers of
God can contaminate distortions from linear flows on scales as large as several
times the small-scale pairwise velocity dispersion sigma_v. Following Peacock &
Dodds (1994), we work in the Fourier domain and propose a model to describe the
anisotropy in the redshift-space power spectrum; tests with high-resolution
numerical data demonstrate that the model is robust for both mass and biased
galaxy halos on translinear scales and above. On the basis of this model, we
propose an estimator of the linear growth parameter beta = Omega^0.6/b, where b
measures bias, derived from sampling functions which are tuned to eliminate
distortions from nonlinear clustering. The measure is tested on the numerical
data and found to recover the true value of beta to within ~10%. An analysis of
the IRAS 1.2Jy galaxies yields beta = 0.8+0.4/-0.3 at a scale of 1,000 km/s
which is close to optimal given the shot noise and the finite survey volume.
This measurement is consistent with dynamical estimates of beta derived from
both real-space and redshift-space information. The importance of the method
presented here is that nonlinear clustering effects are removed to enable
linear correlation anisotropy measurements on scales approaching the
translinear regime. We discuss implications for analyses of forthcoming optical
redshift surveys in which the dispersion is more than a factor of two greater
than in the IRAS data.

investigate some free energy landscape characteristics relevant for dynamics. A
random contact interaction model that satisfies the minimum frustration
principle is used to describe the coil-globule transition (characterized by
T_CG), glass transitions (by T_A and T_K) and folding transition (by T_F).
Trapping on the free energy landscape is characterized by two characteristic
temperatures, one dynamic, T_A the other static, T_K (T_A> T_K), which are
similar to those found in mean field theories of the Potts glass. 1)Above T_A,
the free energy landscape is monotonous and polymer is melted both dynamically
and statically. 2)Between T_A and T_K, the melted phase is still dominant
thermodynamically, but frozen metastable states, exponentially large in number,
appear. 3)A few lowest minima become thermodynamically dominant below T_K,
where the polymer is totally frozen. In the temperature range between T_A and
T_K, barriers between metastable states are shown to grow with decreasing
temperature suggesting super-Arrhenius behavior in a sufficiently large system.
Due to evolutionary constraints on fast folding, the folding temperature T_F is
expected to be higher than T_K, but may or may not be higher than T_A. Diverse
scenarios of the folding kinetics are discussed based on phase diagrams that
take into account the dynamical transition, as well as the static ones.

natural geometrical properties induced by the embedding of the family of
probability distributions into the Hilbert space H. By consideration of the
square-root density function we can regard M as a submanifold of the unit
sphere in H. Therefore, H embodies the `state space' of the probability
distributions, and the geometry of M can be described in terms of the embedding
of in H. The geometry in question is characterised by a natural Riemannian
metric (the Fisher-Rao metric), thus allowing us to formulate the principles of
classical statistical inference in a natural geometric setting. In particular,
we focus attention on the variance lower bounds for statistical estimation, and
establish generalisations of the classical Cramer-Rao and Bhattacharyya
inequalities. The statistical model M is then specialised to the case of a
submanifold of the state space of a quantum mechanical system. This is pursued
by introducing a compatible complex structure on the underlying real Hilbert
space, which allows the operations of ordinary quantum mechanics to be
reinterpreted in the language of real Hilbert space geometry. The application
of generalised variance bounds in the case of quantum statistical estimation
leads to a set of higher order corrections to the Heisenberg uncertainty

expansion. It can be demonstrated that this leads to a form easily recognized
from the Boltzmann equation if the quasiparticle approximation is used. It is
seen that enforcing a quasiparticle approximation suppresses the three body
creation and annihilation processes that would otherwise be present. Including
mesons and hadronization consistently in a $1/N_c$ expansion is discussed
briefly. Some comments on the numerical simulation of the Vlasov equation and
the relaxation time approximation to the collision term are made.

rate is finite at small $k_{\bot}$ and behaves like $1/k^{-4}_{\bot}$ at high
$k_{\bot}$ modulo factors coming from logarithmic terms. The average $k_{\bot}$
is found to be very large ($\sim 10-13 GeV/c$) and practically independent of
energy. This is interpreted as an indication that at present energies we are
still far from the asymptotics and that, apart from supercritical pomerons,
other states contribute significantly.

  This expression is derived under the assumption that the reconstructed system
is in a pure state. In this case the estimation corresponds to an averaging
over a generalized microcanonical ensemble of pure states satisfying a set of
constraints imposed by the measured mean values of the observables under
consideration. We show that via the ``purification'' ansatz, statistical
mixtures can also be consistently reconstructed via the quantum Bayesian
inference scheme. In this case the estimation corresponds to averaging over the
generalized canonical ensemble of states satisfying the given constraints, and
the reconstructed density operator maximizes the von Neumann entropy (i.e.,
this density operator is equal to the generalized canonical density operator
which follows from the Jaynes principle of maximum entropy). We study in detail
the reconstruction of the spin-1/2 density operator and discuss the logical
connection between the three reconstruction schemes, i.e., (1) quantum Bayesian
inference, (2) reconstruction via the Jaynes principle of maximum entropy, and
(3) discrete quantum tomography.
