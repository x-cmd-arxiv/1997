  Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.57.2267",,"astro-ph",,"  The interaction between a wide ultrarelativistic fully-ionized plasma beam
and a magnetic barrier is studied numerically. It is assumed that the plasma
beam is initially homogeneous and impacts with the Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0\gg
1$ on the barrier. The magnetic field of the barrier $B_0$ is uniform and
transverse to the beam velocity. When the energy densities of the beam and the
magnetic field are comparable, $\alpha = 8\pi n_0m_pc^2(\Gamma_0-1)/B^2_0\sim
1$, the process of the beam -- barrier interaction is strongly nonstationary,
and the density of reversed protons is modulated in space by a factor of 10 or
so. The modulation of reversed protons decreases with decrease of $\alpha$. The
beam is found to penetrate deep into the barrier provided that $\alpha >
\alpha_{cr}$, where $\alpha_{cr}$ is about 0.4. The speed of such a penetration
is subrelativistic and depends on $\alpha$. Strong electric fields are
generated near the front of the barrier, and electrons are accelerated in these
fields up to the mean energy of protons, i.e. up to $\sim m_pc^2\Gamma_0$. The
synchrotron radiation of high-energy electrons from the front vicinity is
calculated. Stationary solutions for the beam -- barrier collision are
considered. It is shown that such a solution may be only at $\alpha \lesssim
0.2 - 0.5$ depending on the boundary conditions for the electric field in the
region of the beam -- barrier interaction. Some astrophysical applications of
these results are briefly discussed.

the extinction of light from the background galaxy as it passes through the
disk of the foreground galaxy. We measure the extinction as a function of
wavelength, and find that there is less extinction in the optical bands than
expected from a normal Galactic extinction law. This deviation is significantly
larger in the interarm region than in the spiral arm. The extinction curve in
the spiral arm resembles a Milky Way $R_V=5.0$ dust model and the interarm
extinction curve is flatter (``greyer'') still. We examine the effect of
scattering of background galaxy light into the line of sight and find that it
is negligible. We also examine the effect of an unresolved patchy dust
distribution using a simple two-component dust model as well as the clumpy dust
model of Witt & Gordon (1996). Both models clearly demonstrate that an
unresolved patchy dust distribution can flatten the extinction curve
significantly. When fit to the data, both models suggest that the observed
difference between the arm and interarm extinction curves is caused by the
interarm region of NGC 2207 having a higher degree of dust patchiness (density
ratio between high-density and low-density phases) than the spiral arm region.
We note that an unresolved patchy dust distribution will cause us to
underestimate the average column depth of gas in a galaxy if based solely on
the visual extinction. It is much better to use the infrared extinction for
this purpose.

member at 0.95 Mpc from the Milky Way, is investigated. We characterize the SFH

enrichment law, Z(t). It has been derived by comparing the color-magnitude
diagram of the resolved stars in Pegasus, with a total of 189 model diagrams
produced with different psi(t) and Z(t) laws.
  Star formation began in Pegasus about 15 Gyr ago and was larger, on average,
during the first half than during the second half of the galaxy's life. During
the most recent epoch, the star formation seems to be produced in a bursting
mode. This may have been the case for the whole life of the galaxy, although
the resolution in time towards older epochs is not good enough to actually
detect it. As for the chemical enrichment law, the best way to account for the
observed metallicity of the galaxy (Zf=0.002(+0.002/-0.001) is that it suffered
a prompt initial chemical enrichment. This would be the case if infall was
important and points to a picture in which the galaxy began forming stars and
enriching its interstellar medium in an early phase of collapse.
  Pegasus and NGC 6822 are the only dIrs for which the kind of analysis
presented here has been done. The fact that both galaxies show an important old
to intermediate-age stellar population indicates that the Baade's sheet
observed in most dIr, may in fact be the signature of an important population
of old stars and suggest that dIr actually are old objects populated by large
numbers of old stars. The percentage of dark matter in Pegasus turns out to be
92%.

observed X-ray emission associated with the two radio lobes would be asymmetric
if the radio axis is inclined with respect to the plane of the sky, the
far-away lobe being the more luminous.The ratio between the X-ray luminosities

interatomic forces in bulk silicon. The theoretical results underlying the
model include a novel analysis of elastic properties for the diamond and
graphitic structures and inversions of ab initio cohesive energy curves. The
interaction model includes two-body and three-body terms which depend on the
local atomic environment through an effective coordination number. This
formulation is able to capture successfully: (i) the energetics and elastic
properties of the ground state diamond lattice; (ii) the covalent
re-hybridization of undercoordinated atoms; (iii) and a smooth transition to
metallic bonding for overcoordinated atoms. Because the essential features of
chemical bonding in the bulk are built into the functional form, this model
promises to be useful for describing interatomic forces in silicon bulk phases
and defects. Although this functional form is remarkably realistic by usual
standards, it contains a small number of fitting parameters and requires
computational effort comparable to the most efficient existing models. In a
companion paper, a complete parameterization of the model is given, and
excellent performance for condensed phases and bulk defects is demonstrated.

Several physical implications of the finite-size spectrum are discussed from
the viewpoint of the boundary conformal field theories (BCFT); the conformal
dimension of the spin excitation is quite sensitive to the boundary magnetic
fields, and this sensitivity can be explained in terms of the $\pi/2$-phase
shift of the BCFT. For several limiting cases such as for the half-filling

screening length. For high enough concentrations, the outer sections of the
arms overlap and build a semi-dilute solution (a sea of blobs) where the inner
parts of the actual stars are embedded. The scattering function is evaluated
following a method introduced by Auvray and de Gennes. In the dilute regime
there are three regions in the scattering function: the Guinier region (low
wave vectors, q R << 1) from where the radius of the star can be extracted; the
intermediate region (1 << q R << f^(2/5)) that carries the signature of the
form factor of a star with f arms: I(q) ~ q^(-10/3); and a high wavevector zone
(q R >> f^(2/5)) where the local swollen structure of the polymers gives rise
to the usual q^(-5/3) decay. In the semi-dilute regime the different stars
interact strongly, and the scattered intensity acquires two new features: a
liquid peak that develops at a reciprocal position corresponding to the
star-star distances; and a new large wavevector contribution of the form

ends with a singularity may be extended beyond the latter. The answer is yes. A
local singularity is trivially passable, while the passableness for a global
singularity may invoke CPT transformation. The passableness of the
singularities implies pulsating black holes and the oscillating universe. For
the local singularity, the escape effect takes place: In a vicinity of the

boundary state as well as the form of the purely $(F_{\mu\nu},\theta_\mu^i)$
term of the action. Correspondence between the action in the present formalism
and the low energy effective action (bulk + D-brane actions) in the
$\sigma$-model approach is studied.

approximation are calculated analytically for hydrogenic (atomic) S-states.
These retardation corrections are evaluated numerically for deuterium and
contribute -0.68 kHz, for a total polarization correction of 18.58(7) kHz. Our
results are in agreement with one previous numerical calculation, and the
retardation corrections completely account for the difference between two
previous calculations. The uncertainty in the deuterium polarizability
correction is substantially reduced. At the level of 0.01 kHz for deuterium,
only three primary nuclear observables contribute: the electric polarizability,
$\alpha_E$, the paramagnetic susceptibility, $\beta_M$, and the third Zemach
moment, $< r^3 >_{(2)}$. Cartesian multipole decomposition of the virtual
Compton amplitude and its concomitant gauge sum rules are used in the analysis.

studied using chiral perturbation theory. For normal nuclear matter, the first
non-trivial corrections are estimated based on the independent particle
approximation taking into account nuclear correlations in nuclear medium. The
one-pion-exchange (OPE) two-body interactions turn out to enhance the coupling
constant by $\delta g_A/g_A\simeq (0.09 \sim 0.15)$. The role of the
four-nucleon contact interaction, whose low-energy constants are yet to be
determined, is analyzed in connection with the empirical quenching factor of
$\delta g_A/g_A\simeq -0.2$ in the presence of the nuclear short-range
correlation. Conventional approaches are discussed in the light of our result.

the position of a solute charge. Simulation calculations that apply cutoffs and
periodic boundary conditions based on molecular centers result in
center-dependent contributions to electrostatic energies due to a systematic
sorting of charges in radial shells. This sorting of charges induces a
surface-charge density at the cutoff sphere or simulation-box boundary that
depends on the choice of molecular centers. We identify a simple solution that
gives correct, center-independent results, namely the radial integration of
charge densities. Our conclusions are illustrated for a Lennard-Jones solute in
water. The present results can affect the parameterization of force fields.
