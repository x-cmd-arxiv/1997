  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/304538",,"astro-ph",,"  Optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of the BL Lac object
PKS2155-304 were obtained simultaneously with a continuous UV/EUV/X-ray
monitoring campaign in 1994 May. Further optical observations were gathered
throughout most of 1994. The radio, millimeter, and near-infrared data show no
strong correlations with the higher energies. The optical light curves exhibit
flickering of 0.2-0.3 mag on timescales of 1-2 days, superimposed on longer
timescale variations. Rapid variations of ~0.01 mag/min, which, if real, are
the fastest seen to date for any BL Lac object. Small (0.2-0.3 mag) increases
in the V and R bands occur simultaneously with a flare seen at higher energies.
All optical wavebands (UBVRI) track each other well over the period of
observation with no detectable delay. For most of the period the average colors
remain relatively constant, although there is a tendency for the colors (in
particular B-V) to vary more when the source fades. In polarized light, PKS
2155-304 showed strong color dependence and the highest optical polarization (U
= 14.3%) ever observed for this source. The polarization variations trace the
flares seen in the ultraviolet flux.

mutations modelled as perturbations in the interaction potential between amino
acids is studied. The stability threshold against mutations is shown to be zero
for random heteropolymers on a lattice in two dimensions, whereas a design
procedure modelling evolution produces a non-zero threshold. We introduce an
evolution-like protein design procedure based on an optimization of the
stability threshold that is shown to naturally ensure thermodynamic stability
as well.

masses are introduced from thermal QCD calculations. Assuming a Bjorken-type
longitudinal expansion and including the influence of temperature dependent
masses on the expansion, we determine the total number of c\bar{c} pairs
produced in the quark-gluon plasma phase. We calculate the charm production
rate at leading order with massive gluons and quarks and compare our result to
charm production by massless partons. We consider two different scenarios for
the initial conditions, a parton gas with a rather long kinetic equilibration
time and a minijet gas with a short equilibration time. In a parton gas,
assuming m_c=1.2 GeV, we obtain a substantial enhancement over the thermal
charm rate from massless quarks and gluons, up to 4.9 secondary charm quark
pairs in Au+Au collisions at RHIC and 245 charm pairs in Pb+Pb collisions at
the LHC.

supersymmetric particle, in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model (MSSM). For the first time, we include all coannihilation
processes between neutralinos and charginos for any neutralino mass and
composition. We use the most sophisticated routines for integrating the cross
sections and the Boltzmann equation. We properly treat (sub)threshold and
resonant annihilations. We also include one-loop corrections to neutralino
masses. We find that coannihilation processes are important not only for light
higgsino-like neutralinos, as pointed out before, but also for heavy higgsinos
and for mixed and gaugino-like neutralinos. Indeed, coannihilations should be
included whenever $|\mu| \lsim 2 |M_1|$, independently of the neutralino
composition. When $|\mu| \sim |M_1|$, coannihilations can increase or decrease
the relic density in and out of the cosmologically interesting region. We find
that there is still a window of light higgsino-like neutralinos that are viable
dark matter candidates and that coannihilations shift the cosmological upper
bound on the neutralino mass from 3 to 7 TeV.

multiple commutators of background deformations in quantum closed string field
theory. The conditions are shown to amount to a vanishing theorem for

spaces of higher genus surfaces with two kinds of punctures. Our result is a
generalisation of a previous genus zero analysis relevant to the classical
theory.

the black hole potential $V$ and the gauged central charge potential $P$ for
M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau three-folds. We first show that the
stabilization equations for $Z$ (determining the black hole entropy) take an
extremely simple form in five dimensions as opposed to four dimensions. The
stabilization equations for $Z_m$ are also very simple and determine the size
of the infinite $adS_3$-throat of the string. The black hole potential in
general exhibits two classes of critical points: supersymmetric critical points
which coincide with those of the central charge and non-supersymmetric critical
points. We then generalize the discussion to the entire extended K\""ahler cone
encompassing topologically different but birationally equivalent Calabi-Yau
three-folds that are connected via flop transitions. We examine behavior of the
four potentials to probe the nature of these phase transitions. We find that
$V$ and $P$ are continuous but not smooth across the flop transition, while $Z$
and its first two derivatives, as well as $Z_m$ and its first derivative, are
continuous. This in turn implies that supersymmetric stabilization of $Z$ and
$Z_m$ for a given configuration takes place in at most one point throughout the
entire extended K\""ahler cone. The corresponding black holes (or string states)
interpolate between different Calabi-Yau three-folds. At the boundaries of the
extended K\""ahler cone we observe that electric states become massless and/or
magnetic strings become tensionless.

from the Jacobi-matrix, the first approach also requires the matrix elements of
the Green's operator between the first elements of the basis. In the second
approach the recurrence relation is solved directly by continued fractions and
the solution is continued analytically to the whole complex plane. Both
approaches are illustrated with the non-trivial but calculable example of the
D-dimensional Coulomb Green's matrix. We give the corresponding formulas for
the D-dimensional harmonic oscillator as well.
