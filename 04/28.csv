The other viable possibility is that the UV -- EUV SED is double-peaked, with
the second peaking near 54 eV, its Wien tail the observed soft X-ray excess.

for X-ray transient GRO J0422+32 (X-ray Nova Persei 1992) and recently for

At low hard X-ray luminosity - below 10E37 erg/sec - the kT increases with
increase of L_X. At higher luminosity the spectral hardness depends weaker or

of millisecond pulsars. We apply magnetized accretion disk models to the
pre-collapse accreting magnetic white dwarfs and calculate the white dwarf spin
evolution. If the pulsar magnetic field results solely from the flux-frozen
fossil white dwarf field, a typical millisecond pulsar is born with a field
strength $\sim 10^{11}-10^{12}G$. The uncertainty in the field strength is
mainly due to the uncertain physical parameters of the magnetized accretion
disk models. A simple correlation between the pulsar spin $\Omega_*$ and the
magnetic field $B_*$, $(\Omega_*/10^4s^{-1})\sim (B_{*}/10^{11}G)^{-4/5}$, is
derived for a typical accretion rate $\sim 5\times 10^{-8}M_{\sun}/yr$. This
correlation remains valid for a wide pre-collapse physical conditions unless
the white dwarf spin and the binary orbit are synchronized prior to accretion
induced collapse. We critically examine the possibility of spin-orbit
synchronization in close binary systems. Using idealized homogeneous ellipsoid
models, we compute the electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission from the
millisecond pulsars and find that electromagnetic dipole emission remains
nearly constant while millisecond pulsars may spin up rather than spin down as
a result of gravitational wave emission. We also derive the physical conditions
under which electromagnetic emission from millisecond pulsars formed by
accretion induced collapse can be a source of cosmological gamma-ray bursts. We
find that relativistic beaming of gamma-ray emission and precession of
gamma-ray emitting jets are required unless the dipole magnetic field strengths
are $>10^{15}$G; such strong dipole fields are in excess of those allowed from
the accretion induced collapse formation process except in spin-orbit
synchronization.

short time scales, on the order of days, nearly identical spin-up and spin-down
rates, and very small changes in X-ray luminosity. We propose that this
phenomenon is the result of sudden dynamical changes in the accretion disks
triggered by a gradual variation of mass accretion rates. These sudden torque
reversals may occur at a critical accretion rate $\sim$
$10^{15}-10^{16}g~s^{-1}$ when the system makes a transition from (to) a
primarily Keplerian flow to (from) a substantially sub-Keplerian, radial
advective flow in the inner disk. For systems near spin equilibrium, the
spin-up torques in the Keplerian state are slightly larger than the spin-down
torques in the advective state, in agreement with observation. The abrupt
reversals could be a signature of pulsar systems near spin equilibrium with the
mass accretion rates modulated on a time scale of a year or longer near the
critical accretion rate. It is interesting that cataclysmic variables and black
hole soft X-ray transients change their X-ray emission properties at accretion
rates similar to the pulsars' critical rate. We speculate that the dynamical
change in pulsar systems shares a common physical origin with white dwarf and

maximum light. The flat ultraviolet spectrum in this system requires a
truncated inner accretion disk and an unusually flat radial temperature
profile. This requirement is not satisfied by any non-magnetic steady or
non-steady disk model. We consider a magnetized accretion disk model to explain
the ultraviolet spectrum. The available data on the white dwarf spin and
possible quasi-periodic oscillations constrain the magnetic field, $B_{*}$, and
the disk accretion rate, ${\dot M}$, to lie along a well-defined
spin-equilibrium condition $({\dot M}/10^{17} ~ g ~ s^{-1}) \sim
100(B_{*}/10^7G)^2$. Our self-consistent treatment of the magnetic torque on
the disk flattens the disk temperature distribution outside the disk truncation
radius. This modified temperature distribution is too steep to explain the UV
spectrum for reasonable field strengths. X-ray heating is a plausible
alternative to magnetic heating in GK Per. We estimate that the disk intercepts
$\sim$ 5% of the accretion energy in outburst, which results in an extra disk
luminosity of $\sim$ 5--10 $L_{\odot}$. Model spectra of optically thick disks
are too blue to match observations. The UV spectrum of an optically thick disk
with an optically thin, X-ray heated corona resembles the observed spectrum.
The X-ray luminosity observed during the outburst indicates ${\dot M}<10^{18} ~
g ~ s^{-1}$, which is a factor of 10 lower than that required to explain the
ultraviolet luminosity. Radiation drag on material flowing inward along the
accretion column lowers the shock temperature and reduces the X-ray luminosity.
Most of the accretion energy is then radiated at extreme ultraviolet
wavelengths.

layers in a strong perpendicular magnetic field, within the independent
electron picture, is presented. Assuming fully resolved Landau levels, the
linear response theory expression for the transresistivity $\rho_{21}$ is
evaluated using diagrammatic techniques. The transresistivity is given by an
integral over energy and momentum transfer weighted by the product of the
screened interlayer interaction and the phase-space for scattering events. We
demonstrate, by a numerical analysis of the transresistivity, that for
well-resolved Landau levels the interplay between these two factors leads to
characteristic features in both the magnetic field- and the temperature
dependence of $\rho_{21}$. Numerical results are compared with recent
experiments.
