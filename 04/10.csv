more reliable determination of the central velocity dispersion, which in turn
eliminates the ``$\beta$-problem'' for A3558. The cluster also shows a

coherence of large-scale structures. For Gaussian initial conditions, when the
density fluctuation amplitude is small, tree-level (leading order) perturbation
theory predicts a characteristic dependence of the bispectrum on the shape of
the triangle formed by the three wave vectors. This configuration dependence
provides a signature of gravitational instability, and departures from it in
galaxy catalogs can be interpreted as due to bias, that is, non-gravitational
effects. On the other hand, N-body simulations indicate that the reduced
three-point function becomes relatively shape-independent in the strongly
non-linear regime. In order to understand this non-linear transition and assess
the domain of reliability of shape-dependence as a probe of bias, we calculate
the one-loop (next-to-leading order) corrections to the bispectrum in
perturbation theory. We compare these results with measurements in numerical
simulations with scale-free and CDM initial power spectra. We find that the
one-loop corrections account very well for the departures from the tree-level
results measured in numerical simulations on weakly non-linear scales. In this
regime, the reduced bispectrum qualitatively retains its tree-level shape, but
the amplitude can change significantly. At smaller scales, the reduced
bispectrum in the simulations starts to flatten, an effect which can be
partially understood from the one-loop results. In the strong clustering
regime, where perturbation theory breaks down entirely, the simulation results
confirm that the reduced bispectrum has almost no dependence on triangle shape,
in rough agreement with the hierarchical ansatz.

consistency with the pressure measured in strong galactic winds, argue that it
corresponds to a global star formation intensity limit (\dot\Sigma_{e,90} ~ 45
M_{sun}/kpc^2/yr) rather than being an opacity effect. There are several
important implications of these results: 1. There is a robust physical
mechanism limiting starburst intensity. We note that starbursts have S_e
consistent with the expectations of gravitational instability models applied to
the solid body rotation portion of galaxies. 2. Elliptical galaxies and spiral
bulges can plausibly be built with maximum intensity bursts, while normal
spiral disks can not. 3. The UV extinction of high-z galaxies is significant,
implying that star formation in the early universe is moderately obscured.
After correcting for extinction, the observed metal production rate at z ~ 3
agrees well with independent estimates made for the epoch of elliptical galaxy
formation.

are in the Orion or W49N molecular cloud cores. Since the warm and dense gas,
typical of star-forming cores, is expected to have a large surface filling
factor in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, the maser H_2O emission at 183 GHz

the amplification factor for the H_2O emitting cores in this galaxy should be
higher than for the general CO emitting region. We conclude that the warm and

inferred for gamma-ray bursts regardless of whether they are of galactic or

production transparency in bursts that usually assume an infinite power-law
source spectrum for simplicity, an approximation that is quite adequate for
some bursts detected by EGRET. However, for a given bulk Lorentz factor
\teq{\Gamma}, photons above the EGRET range can potentially interact with
sub-MeV photons in such calculations. Hence it is essential to accurately
address the spectral curvature in bursts seen by BATSE. In this paper we
present the major properties induced in photon-photon opacity considerations by
such spectral curvature. The observed spectral breaks around 1 MeV turn out to
be irrelevant to opacity in cosmological bursts, but are crucial to estimates
of source transparency in the 1 GeV -- 1 TeV range for sources located in the
galactic halo. We find that broad absorption troughs can arise at these
energies for suitable bulk motion parameters \teq{\Gamma}. Such troughs are
probably an unambiguous signature of a galactic halo population, and if
observed by experiments such as Whipple, MILAGRO and GLAST, would provide
powerful evidence that such bursts are not at cosmological distances.

brightness. Quite remarkably, strong X-ray pulsation became unmeasurable when
total X-ray flux had dropped below a certain threshold. Such a phenomenon is a
clear indication of the propeller effects which take place when pulsar
magnetosphere grows beyond the co-rotation radius as a result of the decrease
in mass accretion rate and centrifugal force prevents accreting matter from
reaching the magnetic poles. The entire process should simply reverse as the
accretion rate increases. Indeed, steady X-ray pulsation was reestablished as
the sources emerged from the non-pulsating faint state. These data allow us to
directly derive the surface polar magnetic field strength for both pulsars:
3.1E+13 G for GX 1+4 and 2.4E+11 G for GROJ1744-28. The results are likely to
be accurate to within a factor of 2, with the total uncertainty dominated by

equation for nuclear matter is presented for matter at supernuclear densities
including strange baryons. It contains an adjustable baryon potential energy
density, based on models of local potentials for the baryon-baryon
interactions. The features of the equation rely on the properties of nuclei for
the nucleon-nucleon interactions, and mainly on experimental data from
hypernuclei for the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions. The EoS
is used to calculate equilibrium compositions and thermodynamic properties of
high density matter with strangeness in two astrophysical contexts: neutron
star matter (transparent to neutrinos) and proto-neutron star matter (opaque to
neutrinos). The effective EoS reproduces typical properties of high density
matter found in theoretical microscopic models. Of these, the main result is
that hyperons appear in both types of matter at about twice the nuclear
saturation density, and that their appearance significantly softens the EoS.
The range of maximal masses of neutron stars found in a comprehensive parameter
survey is 1.4-1.7 $M_\odot$. Another typical result is that the maximal mass of
a proto-neutron star with strange baryons is higher than that of an evolved
neutron star (opposite to the case of nuclear matter), setting the stage for a

from those obtained in a purely macroscopic model. For reactions on 208:Pb
targets, shell effects in the entrance channel result in fusion-barrier
energies at the touching point that are only a few MeV higher than the ground
state for compound systems near Z = 110. The entrance-channel fragment-shell
effects remain far inside the touching point, almost to configurations only
slightly more elongated than the ground-state configuration, where the fusion
barrier has risen to about 10 MeV above the ground-state energy. Calculated
single-particle level diagrams show that few level crossings occur until the
peak in the fusion barrier very close to the ground-state shape is reached,
which indicates that dissipation is negligible until very late in the fusion
process. Whereas the fission valley in a macroscopic picture is several tens of
MeV lower in energy than is the fusion valley, we find in the
macroscopic-microscopic picture that the fission valley is only about 5 MeV
lower than the fusion valley for soft-fusion reactions leading to compound
systems near Z = 110. These results show that no significant
``extra-extra-push'' energy is needed to bring the system inside the fission
saddle point and that the typical reaction energies for maximum cross section
in heavy-element synthesis correspond to only a few MeV above the maximum in
the fusion barrier.

find one-dimensional quantum codes of length n=13 and 15 that correct burst
errors of width b < 4; as a comparison, a random-error correcting quantum code
that corrects t=3 errors must have length n > 18. In general, we show that it
is possible to build quantum burst-correcting codes that have near optimal
dimension. For example, we show that for any constant b, there exist
b-burst-correcting quantum codes with length n, and dimension k=n-log n -O(b);

one has to impose on the hypothetical alternative theory precise physical
requirements. We analyse various such constraints and we show step by step how
to meet them. This way of attacking the problem allows to recall and focus on
some relevant features of Bohm's theory. One of the central requirements we
impose on the models we are going to analyse has to do with their
transformation properties under the transformations of the extended Galilei
group. In a context like the one we are interested in one can put forward
various requests that we refer to as physical and genuine covariance and
invariance. Other fundamental requests are that the theory allows the
description of isolated physical systems as well as that it leads to a solution
(in the same sense as Bohmian Mechanics) of the measurement problem. We show
that there are infinitely many inequivalent (from the point of view of the
