systems is investigated by solving the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation in
(E,J_z)-space. We find that large amounts of initial rotation drive the system
into a phase of strong mass loss while it is moderately contracting. The core
is rotating even faster than before although angular momentum is transported
outwards. At the same time the core is heating. Given these features this phase
can be associated with the gravo-gyro 'catastrophe' found by Hachisu (1979).
The increase in central angular momentum levels off after about 2-3 initial
half-mass relaxation times indicating that the source of this `catastrophe' is
depleted. Finally, the central angular velocity increases again, but with a
rather small power of the central density -- the same power as for the central
velocity dispersion during self-similar contraction towards the collapse. The
rotation curves flatten and the ellipticity variations decrease with time, but
their shapes are very similar. These results suggest the existence of a
self-similar solution for a rotating cluster as well. The maximum values of
rotational velocity and ellipticity occur at about the half mass radius.

  Generation Space Telescope"", Greenbelt, April 1997",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The transition between the nearly smooth initial state of the Universe and
its clumpy state today occurred during the epoch when the first stars and
low-luminosity quasars formed. For Cold Dark Matter cosmologies, the radiation
produced by the first baryonic objects is expected to ionize the Universe at
z=10-20 and consequently suppress by 10% the amplitude of microwave
anisotropies on angular scales <10 degrees. Future microwave anisotropy
satellites will be able to detect this signature. The production and mixing of
metals by an early population of stars provides a natural explanation to the
metallicity, ~1% solar, found in the intergalactic medium at redshifts z<5. The
Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will be able to image directly the
``first light'' from these stars. With its nJy sensitivity, NGST is expected to
detect >10^3 star clusters per square arcminute at z>10. The brightest sources,
however, might be early quasars. The infrared flux from an Eddington
luminosity, 10^6 solar mass, black hole at z=10 is 10 nJy at 1 micron, easily
detectable with NGST. The time it takes a black hole with a radiative
efficiency of 10% to double its mass amounts to more than a tenth of the Hubble
time at z=10, and so a fair fraction of all systems which harbor a central
black hole at this redshift would appear active. The redshift of all sources
can be determined from the Lyman-limit break in their spectrum, which overlaps
with the NGST wavelength regime, 1-3.5 micron, for 10<z<35. Absorption spectra
of the first generation of star clusters or quasars would reveal the
reionization history of the Universe. The intergalactic medium might show a
significant opacity to infrared sources at z>10 due to dust produced by the

the unknown fraction of stellar Lyman-continuum photons which can escape into

of nearby intergalactic clouds constrain this fraction to be <~ 20%. The
background ionizing flux from galaxies can exceed the QSO contribution at z~

baryon density associated with photoionized, optically thin gas decreases
rapidly with cosmic time. The results of a recent Hubble Space Telescope survey

be due to the bulk heating and collisional ionization of the intergalactic

  figures. Uses crckapb10.sty",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I briefly review our current knowledge of the cosmological evolution of radio
sources, and show that the redshift distributions of new complete samples of
radio sources confirm the existence of the high-redshift decline in comoving
number density (or `cutoff') beyond $z \simeq 2.5$ first deduced by Dunlop &
Peacock (1990). Taken at face value these new data favour a luminosity
dependent `cutoff', in which the decline is least drastic for the most luminous
radio sources. I demonstrate, however, that regardless of the precise form of
radio source evolution, the evolution of radio luminosity density is well
determined, and appears uncannily similar to the evolution of ultra-violet
luminosity density from star-forming galaxies in the universe (e.g. Madau
1997). I convert radio luminosity density into an estimate of black hole
fueling rate per Mpc$^3$, and conclude that radio source evolution is a good
tracer of the star-formation history of the Universe; at any epoch, for every
10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$ of material converted into stars, approximately 1
M$_{\odot}$ appears to be consumed by radio-loud active galactic nuclei. If
this is indeed true at all epochs, then this would imply that star-formation
activity in the Universe peaked at $z \simeq 2 - 2.5$, and that the values of
star-formation rate density currently derived from Lyman-limit galaxies at $z
\simeq 2.8$ and $z \simeq 4$ are under-estimates by a factor $\simeq 4$.
Finally I briefly speculate as to why radio source evolution might trace global
star-formation activity as manifested primarily in the disc/spiral population,
whereas the hosts of the radio sources themselves generally appear to be
well-evolved elliptical galaxies.

topological entities in some multiply connected spacetime. Here, we show that
topology is too limited a tool to accurately characterize a generic traversable
wormhole: in general one needs geometric information to detect the presence of
a wormhole, or more precisely to locate the wormhole throat. For an arbitrary
static spacetime we shall define the wormhole throat in terms of a
2-dimensional constant-time hypersurface of minimal area. (Zero trace for the
extrinsic curvature plus a ""flare-out"" condition.) This enables us to severely
constrain the geometry of spacetime at the wormhole throat and to derive
generalized theorems regarding violations of the energy conditions-theorems
that do not involve geodesic averaging but nevertheless apply to situations
much more general than the spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne traversable
wormhole. [For example: the null energy condition (NEC), when suitably weighted
and integrated over the wormhole throat, must be violated.] The major technical
limitation of the current approach is that we work in a static spacetime-this
is already a quite rich and complicated system.

Based on the canonical formalism and the Vaidya metric, we proceed to analyze

particular, the requirement of an invariance under rotations around the
transverse axes is difficult to fulfill.In the present work it is investigated,
to which extent rotational invariance is restored in the solution of a
light-cone quantized field theory. The positronium spectrum in full (3+1)
dimensions is calculated at an unphysically large coupling of alpha=0.3 to be
sensitive for terms breaking rotational invariance and to accustomize the
theory to future QCD applications. The numerical accuracy of the formalism is
improved to allow for the calculation of mass eigenvalues for arbitrary
components J_z of the total angular momentum. We find numerically degenerate
eigenvalues as expected from rotationally invariant formalisms and the right
multiplet structures up to large principal quantum numbers. The results
indicate that rotational invariance is unproblematic even in front form
dynamics. Another focus of the work relies on the inclusion of the annihilation
channel. This enlargement of the model is non-trivial and a consistency check
of the underlying theory of effective interactions. The correct numerical
eigenvalue shifts, and especially the right hyperfine splitting are obtained.
Moreover, the cutoff dependence of the eigenvalues is improved drastically by
the annihilation channel for the triplet states. The implications of the
applied effective Hamiltonian approach are discussed in detail.

  The covariant treatment naturally allows one to implement the constraints due
to Lorentz and gauge invariance, crossing symmetry, and the discrete
symmetries.
  In particular, when applied to the $ep\to e'p'\gamma$ reaction,
charge-conjugation symmetry in combination with nucleon crossing generates four
relations among the ten originally proposed generalized polarizabilities of the

in the reaction stages of highest density and during the expansion show that
the system does not reach global equilibrium. Even if a considerable amount of
equilibration is assumed, the connection of the measurable final state to the
macroscopic parameters, e.g. the temperature, of the transient ''equilibrium''
state remains ambiguous.
