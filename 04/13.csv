hyperKaehler manifold X a system of ""weights"" (numbers, one for each trivalent
graph) and used them to construct invariants of topological 3-manifolds. We
give a very simple cohomological definition of these weights in terms of the
Atiyah class of X (the obstruction to existence of a holomorphic connection).
We show that the analogy between the tensor of curvature of a hyperKaehler
metric and the tensor of structure constants of a Lie algebra observed by
Rozansky and Witten, holds in fact for any complex manifold, if we work on the
level of cohomology and for any Kaehler manifold, if we work on the level of
Dolbeault forms. In particular, for any sheaf A of commutative algebras on any
complex manifold the shifted cohomology of the tangent sheaf tensored with A is
a graded Lie algebra. We also show that a certain system of Gilkey-type
complexes of ""natural tensors"" on Kaehler manifolds is, up to suspension
(accounting for various changes of signs), identified with the PROP (in the
sense of Adams and MacLane) describing Lie algebras ""up to higher homotopies"".
As an outcome of our considerations, we give a formula for the Rozansky-Witten
classes using any Kaehler metric on a holomorphic symplectic manifold.

emission, ``after-glow,'' at longer wavelengths. We present several new results
regarding the model predictions, and show that X-ray to optical observations of
GRB970228 and GRB970402 are naturally explained by the model: The scaling of
flux with time and frequency agrees with model predictions and requires a power
law distribution of shock accelerated electrons, dlog N/dlog E=2.3+-0.1
(implying, and consistent with the observed, 1/t decline of flux observed at a
given frequency); The absolute flux value agrees with that inferred through the
model from observed gamma-ray fluence. The future after-glow emission of these
bursts is predicted. The observations indicate that the ratio of magnetic field
to equipartition value and the fraction F of dissipated kinetic energy carried
by electrons are not much smaller than 1. More frequent observations at a fixed
wavelength, or a wide spectrum at a fixed time, would put strong constraints on
these parameters. We show that inverse-Compton scattering suppresses X-ray/
optical emission at delays t<T=10(F/0.3)^4 hr. Observations therefore imply
F<0.3. The strong dependence of T on F implies that T may vary widely from
burst to burst, and that frequent X-ray/optical observations at t~T would
determine F. For F~0.2, inverse-Compton emission dominates during the first
2hr, producing >1GeV photons and providing a natural explanation to the delayed
GeV emission observed in several strong bursts.

SUSY-breaking need not occur through gauge singlets, so that the cosmological
problems often encountered in hidden sector SUSY-breaking can be avoided. iii)
Photino and gluino and $R$-hadron masses are naturally consistent with relic
photinos providing the required dark matter density.
  Requiring spontaneous electroweak symmetry implies that scalar masses are
mostly in the $\sim 100$ GeV range. The gluino and photino are massless at tree
level. At 1-loop, the gluino and photino masses at the ew scale are predicted
to be $m_{\gluino}\sim 10 - 600$ MeV and $m_{\photino} \sim 100 - 1400$ MeV.
New hadrons with mass $\sim 1 \frac{1}{2}$ GeV are predicted and described. The
``extra'' flavor singlet pseudoscalar in the $\iota(1440)$ region which has
been observed in several experiments is naturally interpreted as the
mainly-$\gluino \gluino$ bound state which gets its mass via the QCD anomaly.
Its superpartner, a gluon-gluino bound state, would be the lightest $R$-hadron.
For the most interesting portions of parameter space the $R^0$ lifetime is
$10^{-6} - 10^{-10}$ sec, so existing searches would not have been sensitive to
it. Search strategies and other consequences of the scenario are briefly
mentioned.
