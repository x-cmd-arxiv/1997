critical density for collisional de-excitation of the ^{1}D{_2} level in NII is
lower than that of the same level in OIII, the deviations of the measured

density limit are unlikely to result from collisional de-excitation. The
measured values of T_{[OIII]} and the differences between T_{[OIII]} and
T_{[NII]} are very similar to those found in Galactic planetary nebulae. It is
argued that the dominant form of energy input to the clouds is photoionization,
but detailed modelling indicates that the temperature difference is too large
to be accounted for in terms of photoionization of ionization-bounded clouds.
We propose instead that both matter- and ionization-bounded clouds are present
in the extended emission-line regions, with most of the [OIII] emission
originating from a hot zone in the matter-bounded clouds and essentially all of

on more realistic treatments of the collapse process than the standard approach

  First, we show that the mass function resulting from a new approximate
Lagrangian dynamic (Audit & Alimi 96), contains more objects at high mass, than
the classical PS mass function and is well fitted by a PS-like function with a
threshold density of $\delta_c \simeq 1.4$. However, such a Lagrangian
description can underestimate the epoch of structure formation since it defines
it as the collapse of the first principal axis. We therefore suggest some
analytical prescriptions, for computing the collapse time along the second and
third principal axes, and we deduce the corresponding mass functions. The
collapse along the third axis is delayed by the shear and the number of objects
of high mass then decreases.
  Finally, we show that the shear also strongly affects the formation of
low-mass halos. This dynamical effect implies a modification of the low-mass
slope of the mass function and allows the reproduction of the observed
luminosity function of field galaxies. In a companion paper, we present results
of numerical simulations which complete this work.

parameter n of Sersic's generalized profile law, has recently been put forward
as new extragalactic distance indicator (Young & Currie 1994). Its application
to the Virgo cluster has subsequently led to the claim that the Virgo dEs are
not lying in the cluster core but are distributed in a prolate structure
stretching from 8 to 20 Mpc distance (Young & Currie 1995). This claim is
refuted here. We have fitted a Sersic law to the surface brightness profiles of
128 Virgo cluster dEs and dS0s from the photometry of Binggeli & Cameron
(1991). The dispersion of the n-M relation is indeed large. However, we argue
that this scatter is not due to the depth of the Virgo cluster, but is
essentially intrinsic. Contrary to what one would expect from the cluster depth
hypothesis, there is no clear velocity-``distance'' relation for a sample of 43
Virgo dEs and dS0s with known redshifts. The analysis of Young & Currie (1995)
is hampered by the use of low-resolution photometry and flawed by the
assumption that the n-M and n-R relations can be used independently. By
combining different Sersic law parameters, the scatter of the scaling relations
can be reduced somewhat, but never below sigma_{rms} approx 0.7 mag, at least
for the Virgo cluster. For the purpose of distance measurements, this is
comparable to what one can get already from the <mu>_{eff}-M relation for dEs,
which does not require any profile modelling.

of B,L-generating mechanisms than we currently have.) Electromagnetic helicity
generation is associated (indirectly) with the generation of electroweak
Chern-Simons number through B+L anomalies. This helicity, which in the early
universe is some 30 orders of magnitude greater than what would be expected
from fluctuations alone in the absence of B+L violation, should be reasonably
well-conserved through the evolution of the universe to around the times of
matter dominance and decoupling, because the early universe is an excellent
conductor. Possible consequences include early structure formation; macroscopic
manifestations of CP violation in the cosmic magnetic field (measurable at
least in principle, if not in practice); and an inverse-cascade dynamo
mechanism in which magnetic fields and helicity are unstable to transfer to
larger and larger spatial scales. We give a quasi-linear treatment of the

is included with partial waves up to a total two-body angular momentum of
j_max=6. It is shown that the inclusion of the 3NF slows down the convergence
in the partial waves and j_max=5 is needed in order to achieve converged
results within a few keV. We adjust the cut-off parameter Lambda in the form
factors of the Tuscon-Melbourne 3NF separately for the different NN potentials
to the triton binding energy. This provides a set of phenomenological
three-nucleon Hamiltonians which can be tested in three-nucleon scattering and
systems with A>3. A connection between the probability to find two nucleons at
short distances in the triton and the effect of that 3NF on the triton binding
energy is pointed out.

reaction indicates that the pion-rescattering term has a substantial energy and
momentum dependence. The existing calculations that incorporate this dependence
give pion rescattering contributions significantly larger than those of the
conventional treatment, and this enhanced rescattering term interferes
destructively with the one-body impulse term, leading to theoretical cross
sections that are much smaller than the observed values. However, since the
existing calculations are based on coordinate-space representation, they
involve a number of simplifying assumptions about the energy-momentum flow in
the rescattering diagram, even though the delicate interplay between the
one-body and two-body terms makes it desirable to avoid these kinematical
assumptions. We carry out here a momentum-space calculation that retains the
energy-momentum dependence of the vertices as predicted by chiral perturbation
theory. Our improved treatment increases the rescattering amplitude by a factor
of 3 over the value obtained in the r-space calculations. The pp -> pp pi0
transition amplitude, which is now dominated by the rescattering term, leads to
the cross section much larger than what was reported in the approximate r-space
calculations. Thus, the extremely small cross sections obtained in the previous
chiral perturbative treatments of this reaction should be considered as an
accidental consequence of the approximations employed rather than a general
feature.

  {\bf 36}, 3940 (1995)",,,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  In classical mechanics, the system of two coupled harmonic oscillators is
shown to possess the symmetry of the Lorentz group O(3,3) applicable to a
six-dimensional space consisting of three space-like and three time-like
coordinates, or SL(4,r) in the four-dimensional phase space consisting of two
position and two momentum variables. In quantum mechanics, the symmetry is
reduced to that of O(3,2) or Sp(4), which is a subgroup of O(3,3) or SL(4,r)
respectively. It is shown that among the six Sp(4)-like subgroups, only one
possesses the symmetry which can be translated into the group of unitary
transformations in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, there is the lower
bound in the size of phase space for each mode determined by the uncertainty
principle while there are no restriction on the phase-space size in classical
mechanics. This is the reason why the symmetry is smaller in quantum mechanics.

has to be interpreted as an equation of motion for a statistical ensemble of

unknown intrinsic energy components, they depend on the physical environment by
way of external potentials. Due to these statistical qualities and wave
function normalization, non-locality is inherent to the fundamental relations
of Planck, de Broglie and Schroedinger. A local formulation of these statements
is introduced and briefly assessed, the modified and local Schroedinger
equation is non-linear. Quantum measurements are analyzed in detail, the exact
interplay between causal and statistical reasons in a measurement process can
be accounted for. Examples of individual measurement effects in quantum theory
are given, the treatment of diffraction experiments, neutron interferences,
quantum erasers, the quantum Zeno effect, and interaction-free measurements can
be described consistent with the suggested framework. The paper additionally
provides a strictly local and deterministic calculation of interactions in a
magnetic field. The results suggest that quantum theory is a statistical
formalism which derives its validity in measurements from considering every
possible measurement of a given system. It can equally be established, that the
framework of quantum physics is theoretically incomplete, because a
justification of ensemble qualities is not provided.
