transient x-ray, optical, and infrared emission has been detected. Recent
Hubble Space Telescope observations show that the transient consists of two
components: a point source, which is known to be fading, and an extended
source, which is possibly fading. I fit standard fireball remnant models to the
first month of x-ray, optical, and infrared measurements, which may be done
without assuming a GRB distance scale. I show that its emission is consistent
with that of the remnant of a relativistically expanding impulsive fireball in
which a forward shock dominates the emission of the GRB event: the piston
model. However, two discrepant measurements may indicate that the post-burst
flux varies by factors of approximately 3 on timescales of days or weeks.
Furthermore, using the HST observations and the fitted model, I show that the
extended object probably is fading, which may place GRB 970228 at galactic halo
distances.

estimate total binding mass. The FP coefficients for a sample of 24 early type
and S0 cluster members (alpha=1.30+/-0.36 and beta=0.31+/-0.06) are consistent
with others reported in the literature. We examine the Mg_b distributions
within both subclusters and find them to be indistinguishable. Lacking evidence
for stellar population differences, we interpret the FP zeropoint offset
(\log(D_B/D_A)=-0.037+/-0.046, where D_{cl} is distance to subcluster cl) as a
measure of the distance difference. This measurement is consistent with the
subclusters being at the same distance, and it rules out the Hubble flow
hypothesis (distances proportional to velocity) with 99% confidence; analysis
of the subcluster galaxy magnitude distributions rules out Hubble flow at 93%
confidence. Both results favor a kinematic model where the subclusters are
bound and infalling. We estimate the total cluster binding mass by modelling
the subcluster merger as radial infall. The minimum possible total binding mass
is 1.65 times higher than the sum of the standard virial masses, a difference
statistically significant at the ~3sigma level. We discuss explanations for the
inconsistency including (1) biases in the standard virial mass estimator, (2)
biases in our radial infall mass estimate, and (3) mass beyond the virialized
cluster region; if the standard virial mass is significantly in error, the
cluster has an unusually high mass to light ratio (~1000h). Because
observational signatures of departures from radial infall are absent, we
explore the implications of mass beyond the virialized, core regions.

events at high $Q^2$ in positron-proton collisions. While there exists
insufficient data to conclusively determine the origin of this excess, one
possibility is that it is due to a new leptoquark at mass scale around 200 GeV.
We examine the type of leptoquark states that exist in superstring derived
standard-like models, and show that, while these models may contain the
standard leptoquark states which exist in Grand Unified Theories, they also
generically contain new and exotic leptoquark states with fractional lepton
number, $\pm1/2$. In contrast to the traditional GUT-type leptoquark states,
the couplings of the exotic leptoquarks to the Standard Model states are
generated after the breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$. This important feature of the
exotic leptoquark states may result in local discrete symmetries which forbid
some of the undesired leptoquark couplings. We examine these couplings in
several models and study the phenomenological implications. The flavor
symmetries of the superstring models are found to naturally suppress leptoquark
flavor changing processes.

particles which are present during the decay epoch. Thermal effects can modify
the size of CP violation by a sizeable fraction in the decay of scalar
particles, but we find interesting cancellations in the thermal corrections
affecting the asymmetries in the decays of fermions, as well as in the decay of
scalars in supersymmetric theories. We also estimate the effects which arise
from the motion of the decaying particles with respect to the background
plasma.

via imaginary part analysis. The self-consistency equation for the fermion
self-energy can be reduced from a numerical unstable eigenvalue problem to a
finite dimensional integral which can be solved easily. We can therefore derive
relations between the dynamically generated fermion mass, the coupling, the
gauge boson mass and the cutoff. For infinite cutoff the fermion mass is
independent of the gauge boson mass which should be the relevant scale. Thus
for a defined fermion mass it is necessary to incorporate a running coupling
constant. Within our framework this is possible in a well defined way. The
results are reasonable and in agreement with the renormalization group in the
asymptotic regime.

developed. The technique enables one to compute explicitly the diagonal values
of the heat kernel coefficients, so called Hadamard-Minackshisundaram-De
Witt-Seeley coefficients, as well as their derivatives. The elaborated
technique is applicable for a manifold of arbitrary dimension and for a generic
Riemannian metric of arbitrary signature. It is very algorithmic, and well
suited to automated computation. The fourth heat kernel coefficient is computed
explicitly for the first time. The general structure of the heat kernel
coefficients is investigated in detail. On the one hand, the leading derivative
terms in all heat kernel coefficients are computed. On the other hand, the
generating functions in closed covariant form for the covariantly constant
terms and some low-derivative terms in the heat kernel coefficients are
constructed by means of purely algebraic methods. This gives, in particular,
the whole sequence of heat kernel coefficients for an arbitrary locally
symmetric space.

modulation. The study includes a random component in both the control parameter
of the bifurcation and in the modulation amplitude. Stability boundaries are
computed by either solving the stationary Fokker-Planck equation in the
vicinity of the center manifold of the underlying deterministic system whenever
possible, or by direct numerical solution otherwise. If the modulation
amplitude has a stochastic component, the primary bifurcation is always to
standing waves at a value of the control parameter that depends on the
intensity of the fluctuations. More precisely, and to contrast our results with
the case of a deterministic periodic forcing, the onset of instability in the
standing wave regime is shifted from its deterministic location, and the region
of primary bifurcation to traveling waves disappears yielding instead standing
waves at negative values of the control parameter.
