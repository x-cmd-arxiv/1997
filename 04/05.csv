  Society",,"10.1093/mnras/288.3.691",,"astro-ph",,"  We present time-resolved HST UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical
photometry of the dwarf nova IP Peg in a quiescent state. The observations were
obtained prior to an eclipse, when the bright spot caused by the impact of the
accretion stream with the edge of the disk dominates the light output. The
optical light curve is strongly correlated with the UV spectrophotometric flux
curve. An emission-like feature near 1820 A in the UV spectrum is likely to be
a manifestation of the ``Fe II curtain.'' Composite spectra constructed from
the peaks and troughs of flickers in the light curve show substantial
differences. The spectrum of the flickers is not adequately modelled by a
simple blackbody, suggesting that a more sophisticated model is appropriate. We
perform a cross-correlation analysis of the variability in spectrophotometric
flux curves of the UV continuum and prominent UV emission lines (C II 1335, Si
IV 1400, C IV 1550). The continuum and lines are not correlated, suggesting
that they are produced separately. The C II and Si IV lines are moderately
correlated with each other, but neither line is correlated with C IV,
suggesting that the latter forms in a different region than the former. We
briefly discuss a qualitative model for the geometry of the emission regions in
IP Peg that is consistent with the observed behavior of the UV lines and
continuum.

  Circumnuclear Disks","44 pages, Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/305186",,"astro-ph",,"  SHORT VERSION: The rapidly rotating, masing circumnuclear disk in the central
sub-parsec region of the galaxy NGC 4258 is remarkably circular and Keplerian,
yet a striking asymmetry appears in the maser spectrum: the red-shifted, high-
velocity sources are much more numerous and significantly more intense than the
blue-shifted ones. A similar strong asymmetry appears also in the recently
discovered, masing, circumnuclear disks in NGC 1068 and NGC 4945, thus
suggesting it may be a general phenomenon.
  We show that the observed Doppler-shift asymmetry can naturally arise due to
spiral shocks in circumnuclear disks, independent of the existence of a warp in
the disk or the azimuthal direction to the observer. The high velocities of
these features reflect the rotational velocities in the disk, and have nothing
to do with the shock speed. In NGC 4258 - the currently most well-defined
masing disk - the proposed scenario can also account for the intriguing
clustering of the high-velocity maser spots in distinct clumps, the restricted
spatial distribution of the low-velocity sources, and the dip in the maser
spectrum at the systemic velocity of the disk. In this case we infer a disk
mass of ~10E4 M_sun and a mass accretion rate of order ~7E-3 M_sun/year, which
may be consistent with an advection-dominated accretion flow. The model is
consistent with the observed Keplerian rotation, and introduces only negligible
corrections to the previously derived black hole mass and galaxy distance.
  Predictions include slow systematic drifts in the velocity and position of
all the high-velocity features, and the existence of circumnuclear disks which
are delineated only by high-velocity maser emission.

constructed by combining a conventional N=2 string in the right-moving sector
and a Green-Schwarz-Berkovits type string in the left-moving sector. The
corresponding sigma model is then obtained by turning on background fields for
the massless excitations. We compute the beta functions and we partially check
the OPE's of the superconformal algebra perturbatively in $\alpha'$, all in
superspace. The resulting field equations describe N=1 self-dual supergravity.

distance from a bilipschitz map. From this we prove a geometric version of the
Von Neumann conjecture on amenability. We also get some examples in geometric
groups theory which show that the sign of the Euler characteristic is not a
coarse invariant. Finally we get some general results on uniformly finite
homology which we will apply to manifolds in a later paper.

first proved by Beckner [Be] and Brascamp-Lieb [BL]. The latter also proved a
sharp reverse inequality in the case of exponents less than $1$. Our proof is
simpler and gives Young's inequality and its converse altogether.

from 197Au + 197Au reactions at 1000 MeV per nucleon. The temperatures rise
with decreasing impact parameter from 4 MeV for peripheral to about 10 MeV for
the most central collisions, in good agreement with previous results for
projectile spectators at 600 MeV per nucleon.
  The measured temperatures agree quantitatively with the breakup temperatures
predicted by the statistical multifragmentation model. For these calculations a
relation between the initial excitation energy and mass was derived which gives
good simultaneous agreement for the fragment charge correlations.
  The energy spectra of light charged particles and the behaviour of the mean
kinetic energies of neutrons indicate a substantial component of light particle
emission prior to the final breakup stage.

BNL RHIC and CERN LHC energies from central collisions of gold nuclei. The
collision is assumed to lead to either a thermally and chemically equilibrated
quark gluon plasma, or a free-streaming quark gluon gas having an identical
initial entropy, or a chemically equilibrating quark gluon system, with the
same entropy at $T=T_c$. We also obtain an estimate of hard photon pairs from
initial state quark annihilation and find that the thermal production dominates
the yield up to $M \approx$ 4 GeV at RHIC, and up to 6 GeV at LHC. A simulation
study of decay versus thermal diphotons is presented.

calculations of the meson production rate are performed and compared with the
