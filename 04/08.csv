in galaxy clusters. We have incorporated many of the effects missing from
earlier 1-D treatments: improved modelling of the dark matter and galaxy
distributions, cosmologically realistic evolution of the cluster potential, and
the effects of a multiphase cooling flow. The model utilises a fairly standard
1-D Lagrangian hydrodynamical code to calculate the evolution of the
intracluster gas. This is coupled to a theoretical model for the growth of dark
matter density perturbations. The main advantages of this treatment over 3-D
codes are (1) improved spatial resolution within the cooling flow region, (2)
much faster execution time, allowing a fuller exploration of parameter space,
and (3) the inclusion of additional physics.
  In the present paper, we explore the development of infall models -- in which
gas relaxes into a deepening potential well -- covering a wide range of cluster
mass scales. We find that such simple models reproduce many of the global
properties of observed clusters. Very strong cooling flows develop in these 1-D
cluster models. In practice, disruption by major mergers probably reduces the
cooling rate in most clusters. The models overpredict the gas fraction in low
mass systems, indicating the need for additional physical processes, such as
preheating or galaxy winds, which become important on small mass scales.

alternating spin chains. The DMRG procedure is also employed to obtain
low-temperature thermodynamic properties of these systems. We consider a 2N
site system with spins $s_1$ and $s_2$ alternating from site to site and
interacting via a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic exchange. The three systems
studied correspond to $(s_1 ,s_2 )$ being equal to $(1,1/2),(3/2,1/2)$ and
$(3/2,1)$; all of them have very similar properties. The ground state is found
to be ferrimagnetic with total spin $s_G =N(s_1 - s_2)$. We find that there is
a gapless excitation to a state with spin $s_G -1$, and a gapped excitation to
a state with spin $s_G +1$. Surprisingly, the correlation length in the ground
state is found to be very small for this gapless system. The DMRG analysis
shows that the chain is susceptible to a conditional spin-Peierls instability.
Furthermore, our studies of the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility $\chi$
and specific heat show strong magnetic-field dependences. The product $\chi T$
shows a minimum as a function of temperature T at low magnetic fields; the
minimum vanishes at high magnetic fields. This low-field behavior is in
agreement with earlier experimental observations. The specific heat shows a
maximum as a function of temperature, and the height of the maximum increases
sharply at high magnetic fields. Although all the three systems show
qualitatively similar behavior, there are some notable quantitative differences
between the systems in which the site spin difference, $|s_1 - s_2|$, is large
and small respectively.

distributions are often seen near transitions, or critical points. We study the
zero temperature random field Ising model as a model for noise and avalanches

ordinary critical point with avalanches on all length scales. We study this
critical point in 6-epsilon dimensions, and with simulations in 2, 3, 4, 5, 7,

in principle only occur for a special value of the randomness (the critical
point), but many decades of scaling occur quite far from this special value:
three decades of scaling (a publishable experiment) are obtained a factor of
two away from the critical value. Perhaps many of the power laws observed in
nature are just systems near their critical points?

of the phases of the pure system is investigated as a function of interactions

repulsive side is strongly localized whereas the system with attractive
interactions is stable with respect to disorder, at variance with the single
chain case. For fermions with spins, the repulsive side is also localized, and
in particular the d-wave superconducting phase found for the pure system is
totally destroyed by an arbitrarily small amount of disorder. On the other hand
the attractive side is again remarkably stable with respect to localization. We
have also computed the charge stiffness, the localization length and the
temperature dependence of the conductivity for the various phases. In the range
of parameter where d-wave superconductivity would occur for the pure system the
conductivity is found to decrease monotonically with temperature, even at high
temperature, and we discuss this surprising result. For a model with one site
repulsion and nearest neighbor attraction, the most stable phase is an orbital
antiferromagnet . Although this phase has no divergent superconducting
fluctuation it can have a divergent conductivity at low temperature. We argue

Wilson, Mathews and Marronetti (WMM) show a rising central energy density of
the stars as the orbital separation shrinks, i.e. the stars are individually
crushed as they near coalescence. They claim this ``star-crushing'' effect is
partially due to a non-linear, first post-Newtonian order enhancement of the
self-gravity of each star caused by the presence of the other star. We present
a concrete calculation which shows, within general relativity, first
post-Newtonian order interactions with the other star leave the central energy
density unchanged as the orbital radius shrinks. The results presented here are
in sharp disagreement with the WMM claim. However, alternative gravitational
theories, such as Brans-Dicke theory, can exhibit a small crushing effect in
the binary constituents as they near coalescence. We show that the absence of
the star-crushing effect at first post-Newtonian order is related to adherence
to the strong equivalence principle.

means of quantum gravity holding near the apparent horizons. We consider a
gedanken experiment whether or not a black hole with the electric charge $Q$
less than the mass $M$ ($Q < M$) could increase its charge to go beyond the
extremal limit $Q = M$ by absorbing the external charged matters. If the black
hole charge could exceed the extremal value, a naked singularity would be
liberated from the protection of the outer horizon and visible to distant
observers, which means weak cosmic censorship to be violated in this process.
It is shown that the black hole never exceeds the extremal black hole this way
in quantum gravity as in classical general gravity. An increment of the trapped
external charged matters by the black hole certainly causes the inner Cauchy
horizon to approach the outer horizon, but its relative approaching speed
gradually slows down and stops precisely at the extremal limit. It is quite
remarkable that cosmic censorship remains true even in quantum gravity. This
study is the first attempt of examining weak cosmic censorship beyond the

redundancy of description corresponding to small changes in the choice of the

lead to a non-trivial constraint on the form of the effective theory, known as
Reparameterization Invariance. For spin-1/2 quarks, the precise form of the
constraint and its solution at the level of the effective lagrangian have
proven to be rather subtle, and the original proposal by Luke and Manohar has
been questioned. In this paper I employ a version of Heavy Quark Effective
Theory containing the ``anti-particle'' field as a non-propagating auxiliary
field, which greatly simplifies keeping track of v-dependence. This permits a
very simple derivation of Reparameterization Invariance from first principles.
The auxiliary field can also be integrated out to return to the standard
formulation of the effective theory, but with the effective lagrangian now
satisfying the full reparameterization constraint. I compare this result with
earlier proposals.

the framework of the heavy quark expansion is performed. The baryon matrix
element is evaluated using the bag model and the nonrelativistic quark model.
We find that bottom-baryon lifetimes follow the pattern
$\tau(\Omega_b)\simeq\tau(\Xi_b^-)>\tau(\Lambda_b)\simeq\tau(\Xi_b^0)$.
However, neither the lifetime ratio $\tau(\Lambda_b)/\tau( B_d)$ nor the
absolute decay rates of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon and $B$ mesons can be explained.
One way of solving both difficulties is to allow the presence of linear $1/m_Q$
corrections by scaling the inclusive nonleptonic width with the fifth power of
the hadron mass $m_{H_Q}$ rather than the heavy quark mass $m_Q$. The hierarchy
of bottom baryon lifetimes is dramatically modified to
$\tau(\Lambda_b)>\tau(\Xi_b^-)>\tau(\Xi_b^0)>\tau( \Omega_b)$: The
longest-lived $\Omega_b$ among bottom baryons in the OPE prescription now
becomes shortest-lived. The replacement of $m_Q$ by $m_{H_Q}$ in nonleptonic
widths is natural and justified in the PQCD-based factorization approach
formulated in terms of hadron-level kinematics. For inclusive charmed baryon
decays, we argue that since the heavy quark expansion does not converge, local
duality cannot be tested in this case. We show that while the ansatz of
substituting the heavy quark mass by the hadron mass provides a much better
description of the charmed-baryon lifetime {\it ratios}, it appears unnatural
and unpredictive for describing the {\it absolute} inclusive decay rates of
charmed baryons, contrary to the bottom case.

fundamental vortex flux unit and certain multiples of the fundamental charge of
the unbroken U(1) gauge field can appear as free particles. Adding the usual CS
term for the broken U(1) gauge fields does not change much. It merely leads to
additional Aharonov-Bohm interactions among these particles. Upon introducing
the CS term for the unbroken U(1) gauge fields, in contrast, the confinement
phenomenon completely disappears.

energy 1.93 AGeV. The $m_t$ distributions of K^+ mesons are well described by a
single Boltzmann-type function. The spectral slopes are similar to that of the
protons indicating that rescattering plays a significant role in the

distributions over the remaining phase space. The total K^+ meson yield has
been determined at beam energies of 1.06, 1.45, and 1.93 AGeV, and is presented
in comparison to existing data. The low total yield indicates that the K^+
meson can not be explained within a hadro-chemical equilibrium scenario,
therefore indicating that the yield does remain sensitive to effects related to
its production processes such as the equation of state of nuclear matter and/or
modifications to the K^+ dispersion relation.

requires covariant spinors, field operators, propagators and model
interactions. Guided by an approach originally proposed by Weinberg, we
construct from group theoretical arguments the (j,0)+(0,j) covariant spinors
and the field operators for a massive particles. Specific examples are worked
out in the familiar language of the Bjorken and Drell text for the case of the
(1,0)+(0,1), (3/2,0)+(0,3/2) and (2,0)+(0,2) matter fields. The m\to 0 limit of
the covariant spinors is shown to have the expected structure. The algebra of
the \gamma^{\mu\nu} matrices associated with the (1,0)+(0,1) matter fields is
presented, and the conserved current derived. The procedure readily extends to
higher spins. The causality problem associated with the j\ge 1 wave equations
is discussed in detail and a systematic procedure to construct causal
propagators is provided. As an example a spin two wave equation satisfied by
the (2,0)+(0,2), covariant spinors is found to support not only ten correct and
causal solutions, but also thirty physically unacceptable acausal solutions.
However, we demonstrate how to construct the Feynman propagator for the higher
spin particles directly from the spinors and thus avoid the shortcomings of the
wave equation in building a phenomenology. The same exercise is repeated for
the (1,0)+(0,1) and (3/2,0)+(0,3/2) matter fields, and the same conclusions
obtained. Massless limit is discussed in detail. (Typos uncorrected, Part of

recoupling approach according to the complementary group technique given in

SU(n) are not unique with respect to canonical outer multiplicity labels, and
can be transformed from one set of outer multiplicity labels to another. The
transformation matrices are elements of SO(m), where m is the number of
occurrence of the corresponding irrep (\lambda\mu) in the decomposition

kind of the reduced Wigner coefficients with multiplicity is obtained after a
special SO(m) transformation. New features of this kind of reduced Wigner
coefficients and the differences from the reduced Wigner coefficients with
other choice of the multiplicity label given previously are discussed. The
method can also be applied to the derivation of general SU(n) Wigner or reduced
Wigner coefficients with multiplicity. Algebraic expression of another kind of

problems --- typically the Painlev\'e transcendents --- in a suitable
asymptotic region look like a kind of ``modulation'' of isospectral problem.
This connection between isomonodromic and isospectral problems is reconsidered
here in the light of recent studies related to the Seiberg-Witten solutions of
$N = 2$ supersymmetric gauge theories. A general machinary is illustrated in a
typical isomonodromic problem, namely the Schlesinger equation, which is
reformulated to include a small parameter $\epsilon$. In the small-$\epsilon$
limit, solutions of this isomonodromic problem are expected to behave as a
slowly modulated finite-gap solution of an isospectral problem. The modulation
is caused by slow deformations of the spectral curve of the finite-gap
solution. A modulation equation of this slow dynamics is derived by a heuristic
method. An inverse period map of Seiberg-Witten type turns out to give general
solutions of this modulation equation. This construction of general solution
also reveals the existence of deformations of Seiberg-Witten type on the same
moduli space of spectral curves. A prepotential is also constructed in the same
way as the prepotential of the Seiberg-Witten theory.
