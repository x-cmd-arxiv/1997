  file. 19 pages. 6 figures EPS format",,,,"hep-ph",,"  Multiplicities of charged secondary hadrons in the relativistic
nucleus-nucleus collisions in a wide energy range are analysed on the basis of
partial stimul- ting emission and cluster cascading models. The experimental
data are obtained by means of the two metre propane bubble chamber of JINR
(Dubna). The results are compared with the correponding data for pp and anti
pp-colli- sions at higher energies. It is shown that the regularities in pp and
anti pp- interactions at high energies and wide energy range and in
nucleus-nucleus interactions at relatively low energies per nucleon and
narrower energy range are similar.

the proton over the region 0.01 < x < 0.1. The procedure involves the
measurement of high p_t asymmetric direct photon and jet final states in pp
interactions. This measurement can be made at the RHIC collider running in pp
mode at an energy of sqrt(s)=500 GeV/c. This analysis identifies a region of
phase space where the contribution from quark-antiquark annihilation
uncharacteristically approaches the magnitude of the contribution from the
leading process, quark-gluon Compton scattering. The forward-backward angular
asymmetry in the parton center of mass is sensitive to the antiquark content of
the proton and the ubar parton density function can be extracted.
