composition is best described in terms of (i) a general enhancement of the
refractory elements relative to the volatile ones, and (ii) among the volatile
elements, an enhancement of the heavier elements relative to the lighter ones;
this mass dependence most likely reflects a mass-to-charge (A/Q) dependence of
the acceleration efficiency; among the refractory elements, there is NO such
enhancement of heavier species, or only a much weaker one. We regard as
coincidental the similarity between the GCRS composition and that of the solar
corona, which is biased according to first ionization potential. In a companion
paper, this GCRS composition is interpreted in terms of an acceleration by
supernova shock waves of interstellar and/or circumstellar (eg Ne22 rich
Wolf-Rayet wind) gas-phase and especially dust material.

Explorer of a new, up to then unknown astrophysical phenomenon. It turned out
that accreting low magnetic-field neutron stars show quasi-periodic
oscillations in their X-ray flux at rates of up to more than a kilohertz. These
kHz QPO, now reported from eleven different systems, are among the fastest
phenomena in the sky and can provide us with new information about the
fundamental properties of neutron stars and help testing general relativity in
the strong-field regime. If, for example, their frequencies can be identified
with the Keplerian frequencies of matter in orbit around a 1.4 Solar-mass
neutron star, then the radius of the star would have to be less than 15 km,
which directly constrains the equation of state of bulk nuclear-density matter,
and for an only slightly tighter orbit or slightly more massive neutron star
the orbital radius would equal the Schwarzschild-geometry general-relativistic
marginally stable orbit (12.5 km for a 1.4 Solar mass object). So far all
models that have been put forward for explaining the new phenomenon have
encountered problems. In this paper I review the relatively simple and highly
suggestive phenomenology as it has emerged from the data up to now, and discuss
some of the proposed models.

variability X-ray data obtained from accreting neutron stars and black holes.
First I give an account of the statistical methods that are at present commonly
applied in this field. These are mostly based on Fourier techniques. To a large
extent these methods work well: they give astronomers the answers they need.
Then I discuss a number of statistical questions that astronomers don't really
know how to solve properly and that statisticians may have ideas about. These
questions have to do with the highest and the lowest frequency ranges
accessible in the Fourier analysis: how do you determine the shortest time
scale present in the variability, how do you measure steep low-frequency noise.
The point is stressed that in order for any method that resolves these issues
to become popular, it is necessary to retain the capabilities the current
methods already have in quantifying the complex, concurrent variability
processes characteristic of accreting neutron stars and black holes.

velocity dispersion similar to local dynamically hot galaxies. But for any
given sigma, Mgb of the distant ellipticals is significantly lower than the
mean value of the nearby sample. The difference of Mgb between the two samples
is small and can be fully attributed to the younger age of the distant stellar
populations in accordance with the passive evolution model. The low reduction
of Mgb at a look-back time of about 5 Gyrs requires that the bulk of the stars
in cluster ellipticals have formed at very high redshifts of z_f>2. For the
most massive galaxies, where the reduction is even lower, z_f probably exceeds
4.
  Unlike most methods to measure the evolution of ellipticals using
luminosities, surface brightnesses or colours, the Mgb linestrength does not
depend on corrections for extinction and cosmic expansion (K-correction) and
only very little on the slope of the initial mass function. The combination of
a kinematical parameter with a stellar population indicator allows us to study
the evolution of very similar objects. In addition, the good mass estimate
provided by sigma means that the selection criteria for the galaxy sample as a
whole are well controlled.

storage ring beginning to form. Such an increasing dipole magnetic field

we calculate the exponential suppression factor for the catalysed decay rate at

to be more important than spontaneous decay for sufficiently thin-walled

that spontaneous decay will dominate for the case of thick-walled bubbles.

decays. We first show, using the $D^+\to \bar{K}^0\pi^+\pi^0$ decay channel as
an example, how an inadequate extraction of the non-resonant contribution could
yield incorrect measurements for the resonant channels. We analyse how the
correct study of this decay will provide a test for the validity of
factorization in D meson decays. Finally, we show how form factors could be
extracted from non-resonant decays. We particularly discuss about the form
factor that can be measured from the $D^+_s\to \pi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ decay. We
emphasize on its relevance for the study of the decay $\tau \to \nu_{\tau}
3\pi$ and the extraction of the $a_1$ meson width.

dilaton is defined. This is done by defining the supersymmetric dilaton
geometry which is motivated by the supersymmetric volume preserving
diffeomorphisms. The resulting model is classical superconformal field theory
with an additional dilaton-axion supermultiplet coupled to the supersymmetric
gauge theory, where the dilaton-axion couplings are nonrenormalizable. The
possibility of spontaneous scale symmetry breaking is investigated in this
context. There are three different types of vacua with broken scale symmetry
depending on the details of the dilaton sector: unbroken supersymmetry,
spontaneously broken supersymmetry and softly broken supersymmetry. If the
scale symmetry is broken in the bosonic vacuum, then the Poincar\'e
supersymmetry must be broken at the same time. If the scale symmetry is broken
in the fermionic vacuum but the bosonic vacuum remains invariant, then the
Poincar\'e supersymmetry can be preserved as long as the R-symmetry breaking is
specifically related to the scale symmetry breaking.

BPS monopoles, \tilde{M}_{k}. For k=2 the integral can be evaluated using the
explicit metric on \tilde{M}_{2} found by Atiyah and Hitchin. In this case the
integral is equal to the Euler character of the manifold. More generally the
integral is the volume contribution to the index of the Euler operator on
\tilde{M}_{k}, which may differ from the Euler character by a boundary term. We
conjecture that the boundary terms vanish and evaluate the multi-instanton

symmetric and real ``three-diagonal'' matrices, with the sum of their elements
obeying a supremum condition, together with a constraint forcing the absolute
value of the maximal eigenvalue to be equal to 1. In even dimensions, these
matrices are unipotent of order two, while in odd dimensions only their squares
are Markovian. We suggest that these bi-graded Markovian matrices (i.e.
consisting in the square roots of Markovian matrices) can be thought of as
non-local Dirac operators. The eigenvectors of these matrices are spinors.
Treating these matrices as determining the stochastic time evolution of states
might explain why one observes only left handed neutrinos. Some other physical
interpretations are suggested. We end by presenting a mathematical conjecture
applying to q-graded Markovian matrices.

quotient of a topological space by an action of a group. The method is to
represent the original topological space as a homotopy limit of a diagram, and
then act with the group on that diagram. Once it is possible to understand what
the action of the group on every space in the diagram is, and what it does to
the morphisms, we can compute the homology groups of the homotopy limit of this
quotient diagram.
  Our motivating example is the symmetric deleted join of a simplicial complex.
It can be represented as a diagram of symmetric deleted products. In the case
where the simplicial complex in question is a simplex, we perform the complete
computation of the homology groups with $\mathbb Z_p$ coefficients. For the
infinite simplex the spaces in the quotient diagram are classifying spaces of
various direct products of symmetric groups and diagram morphisms are induced
by group homomorphisms. Combining Nakaoka's description of the $\mathbb
Z_p$-homology of the symmetric group with a spectral sequence, we reduce the
computation to an essentially combinatorial problem, which we then solve using
the braid stratification of a sphere. Finally, we give another description of
the problem in terms of posets and complete the computation for the case of a
finite simplex.

contemporary with the fundamental works of L. de Broglie. In that paper, one
can find the basic formulae and their interpretation as they were adopted by
Feynman twenty years later. We believe that Wentzel's work was forgotten for
several reasons: (I) Schr\""odinger's equation was much simpler to deal with
(Wentzel himself contributed to its development in the same way as L.Brillouin
and H.Kramers did). (II) The first application was rejected by Heisenberg and
Kramers. (III) The approximation used by Wentzel was too na\""\i ve and failed.
Nevertheless, the foundation laid by Wentzel was sound, as it has been shown by
Feynman's work. Therefore, Wentzel has to be considered as one of the founders
of quantum mechanics.
