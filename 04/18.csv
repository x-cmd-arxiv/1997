with neural networks. In this model, the length of cycle time period of traffic
lights at each signal is autonomously adapted. We find a self-organizing
collective behavior of such a model through simulation on a one-dimensional
lattice model road: traffic congestion is greatly diffused when traffic signals
have such autonomous adaptability with suitably tuned parameters. We also find
that effectiveness of the system emerges through interactions between units and
shows a threshold transition as a function of proportion of adaptive signals in
the model.

kinematic characteristics of high redshift damped lya systems. Because damped
lya systems are widely believed to be the progenitors of current massive
galaxies, an analysis of their kinematic history allows a direct test of galaxy
formation scenarios.
  We have collected a kinematically unbiased sample of 17 high S/N ratio, high
resolution damped lya spectra taken with HIRES on the 10m W.M. Keck Telescope.
Our study focuses on the unsaturated, low-ion transitions of these systems
which reveal their kinematic traits. The profiles exhibit a nearly uniform
distribution of velocity widths ranging from 20 - 200 km/s and a relatively
high degree of asymmetry. In an attempt to explain these characteristics, we
introduce several physical models, which have previously been attributed to
damped lya systems, including rapidly rotating cold disks, slowly rotating hot
disks, massive isothermal halos, and a hydrodynamic spherical accretion model.
  Using standard Monte Carlo techniques, we run sightlines through these model
systems to derive simulated low-ion profiles. Comparing statistical measures of
the simulated profiles with the observed profiles, we determine that the
rapidly rotating cold disk model is the only tested model consistent with the
data at high confidence levels. A Relative Likelihood Test of the rapidly
rotating cold disk model indicates the disks must have large rotation speeds; v
> 180 km/s at the 99% c.l. In turn, we demonstrate that the Cold Dark Matter
Model, as developed by Kauffmann (1996), is inconsistent with the damped lya
data at very high c.l. This is because the CDM Model does not predict a large
enough fraction of rapidly rotating disks at z approx 2.5.

the case of a standard isothermal halo, the scenario is consistent not only
with MACHO observations but also with cluster dynamical constraints and
number-count limits imposed by 20 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) fields. The
present work extends the original study by considering the dependency of the
results on halo model, and by increasing the sample of HST fields to 51
(including the Hubble Deep Field and Groth Strip fields). The model dependency
of the results is tested using the same reference power-law halo models
employed by the MACHO team. For the unclustered scenario HST counts imply a
model-dependent halo fraction of at most 0.5-1.1% (95% confidence), well below
the inferred MACHO fraction. For the cluster scenario all the halo models
permit a range of cluster masses and radii to satisfy HST, MACHO and dynamical
constraints. Whilst the strong HST limits on the unclustered scenario imply
that at least 95% of halo stars must reside in clusters at present, this limit
is weakened if the stars which have escaped from clusters retain a degree of
clumpiness in their distribution.

by Becker et al. (1997). We present JHK observations of this object and three

1556+3517 has B-K=6.63, redder than all but one or two known z>1 quasars. This
strongly suggests the observed continuum of this quasar is reddened by dust.
Even when this extreme reddening is taken into account 1556+3517 is still
probably radio-loud, although near-IR spectroscopy to measure its Balmer
decrement will be needed to verify this. In addition, since it is a
flat-spectrum object, VLBI observations to determine the extent (if any) to
which beaming affects our estimate of its radio luminosity will be needed
before 1556+3517 can be unequivocally declared a radio-loud BAL. We also use
our data and data from the literature to show that optically selected BALs as a
class have B-K colors consistent with the observed distribution for optically
selected quasars as a whole. Thus there is currently no evidence that the
tendency of optically selected BALs to be preferentially radio-intermediate
(Hooper, Francis, & Impey 1993) is due to extinction artificially lowering
estimated BAL optical luminosities. However, as most quasar surveys, both radio
and optical, would be insensitive to a population of reddened radio-quiet BALs,
the existence of a large population of reddened BALs similar to 1556+3517

special-purpose, fully hardwired computing engine, and a multi-purpose,
reconfigurable system. The driving application will be a suite of
particle-based large-scale simulations in various areas of physics. The
prototype system will achieve performance in the $\sim 50 - 100$ teraflops
range for a broad class of applications in this area. The combination of a
hardwired petaflops-class computational engine and a front end with sustained
speed on the order of 10 gigaflops can produce extremely high performance, but
only for the limited class of problems in which there exists a single
bottleneck with computing cost dominating the total. While the calculation for
which the Grape-4 (our system's immediate predecessor) was designed is a prime
example of such a problem, in many other applications the primary computational
bottleneck, while still related to an inverse-square (gravitational, Coulomb,
etc.) force, requires less than 99% of the computing power. Although the
remainder of the CPU time is typically dominated by just one secondary
bottleneck, its nature varies greatly from problem to problem. It is not
cost-effective to attempt to design custom chips for each new problem that
arises. FPGA-based systems can restore the balance, guaranteeing scalability
from the teraflops to the petaflops domain, while still retaining significant
flexibility. (abbreviated abstract)

for a remarkable drop of the stellar velocity dispersion values in the central
region. To investigate the dynamics of the disc a theoretical framework has
been described. This includes a mass decomposition of the galaxy into a family
of disc/halo realizations compatible with the observed photometry and rotation
curve. For this family stellar velocity dispersion values and stability
parameters were calculated, showing that the more massive discs, although
having larger dispersions, are less stable. However, a reliable theoretical
description of the inner regions where the drop occurs cannot be given.
  That is why we have resorted to numerical calculations. Pure stellar 3d
simulations have been performed for the family of decompositions. A clear
result is that disc/dark halo mass ratios approaching those of the maximum disc
limit generate a large bar structure. This is incompatible with the observed
morphology of NGC 6503. For the larger radii the stellar kinematics resulting
from the simulations essentially agrees with that predicted by the theory, but
the central velocity dispersion drop could not be reproduced.
  A close inspection reveals that the central nuclear region is very small and
bright. Therefore, tentatively, this nucleus was considered as an isothermal
sphere and a core fitting procedure was applied. For an adopted equal
mass-to-light ratio of disc and nucleus, a velocity dispersion of 21.5 km/s is
predicted, in excellent agreement with the observed central value. The observed
dispersion drop can thus be explained by a separate kinematically distinct
galactic component.

standard averaging introduces a noise, and a corresponding new diverging length

independent of the system's own correlation length \xi. Therefore \nu can be
less than 2/d. We illustrate these ideas on two exact examples, with \nu < 2/d.

effects are taken into account via diagrammatic and renormalization group
methods. For d>2, the mean-field rate equation, which predicts an active phase
as soon as the branching process is switched on, applies qualitatively for both
even and odd m, but the behavior in lower dimensions is shown to be quite
different for these two cases. For even m, and d~2, the active phase still
appears immediately, but with non-trivial crossover exponents which we compute
in an expansion in eps=2-d, and with logarithmic corrections in d=2. However,
there exists a second critical dimension d_c'~4/3 below which a non-trivial
inactive phase emerges, with asymptotic behavior characteristic of the pure
annihilation process. This is confirmed by an exact calculation in d=1. The
subsequent transition to the active phase, which represents a new non-trivial
dynamic universality class, is then investigated within a truncated loop
expansion. For odd m, we show that the fluctuations of the annihilation process
are strong enough to create a non-trivial inactive phase for all d<=2. In this
case, the transition to the active phase is in the directed percolation
universality class.

tense current ribbons flowing along the superconducting-normal interfaces and
subject to the constraint of global flux conservation. The validity of this
model is tested through a detailed reanalysis of Landau's original conformal
mapping treatment of the laminar state, in which the superconductor-normal
interfaces are flared within the slab, and of a closely-related straight-lamina
model. A simplified dynamical model is described that elucidates the nature of
possible shape instabilities of flux stripes and stripe arrays, and numerical
studies of the highly nonlinear regime of those instabilities demonstrate
patterns like those seen experimentally. Of particular interest is the buckling
instability commonly seen in the intermediate state. The free-boundary approach
further allows for a calculation of the elastic properties of the laminar
state, which closely resembles that of smectic liquid crystals. We suggest
several new experiments to explore of flux domain shape instabilities,
including an Eckhaus instability induced by changing the out-of-plane magnetic
field, and an analog of the Helfrich-Hurault instability of smectics induced by
an in-plane field.

fluctuations arise when the retarded Green's function for a massless field is
averaged over these metric fluctuations. This averaging replaces the
delta-function on the classical lightcone with a Gaussian function, the width
of which is a measure of the scale of the lightcone fluctuations. Horizon
fluctuations are taken to be measured in the frame of a geodesic observer
falling through the horizon. In the case of an expanding universe, this is a
comoving observer either entering or leaving the horizon of another observer.
In the black hole case, we take this observer to be one who falls freely from
rest at infinity. We find that cosmological horizon fluctuations are typically
characterized by the Planck length. However, black hole horizon fluctuations in
this model are much smaller than Planck dimensions for black holes whose mass
exceeds the Planck mass. Furthermore, we find black hole horizon fluctuations
which are sufficiently small as not to invalidate the semiclassical derivation

well with recent experimental extractions. We obtain a lower bound of 1/3 on
the slope-parameter $\rho^2 \equiv -\xi^\prime(1)$, which, in calculations with
realistic input, is exceeded by a great deal: agreement with experimental data
requiring $\rho^2 \sim 1.2 - 1.6$. The flavour and momentum dependence of the

employ a couple of modes of the electromagnetic field. One scheme uses
unconventional heterodyne detection, with correlated signal and image-band
modes in a twin-beam state from parametric downconversion. The other scheme is
realized through a complex-number coding over quadrature-squeezed states of two
uncorrelated modes, each detected by ordinary homodyning. This equivalence
concerns all the stages of the communication channel: the encoded state, the
optimal amplifier for the channel, the master equation modeling the loss, and
the output measurement scheme. The unitary transformation that connects the two
communication schemes is realized by a frequency conversion device.

electron interference pattern in an approximation in which the electrons follow
classical trajectories, an ultraviolet divergence results. It is shown that
this divergence is an artifact of the classical trajectory approximation, and
is absent when the finite sizes of electron wavepackets are accounted for. It
is shown that the vacuum fluctuation effect has a logarithmic dependence upon
the wavepacket size. However, at least in one model geometry, this dependence
cancels when one includes both vacuum fluctuation and photon emission effects.

condensates which are initially in mixed states. We consider in detail the two
cases where each condensate is initially in a thermal or a Poisson distribution
of atom number. Although initially there is no relative phase between the
condensates, a sequence of spatial atom detections produces an interference
pattern with arbitrary but fixed relative phase. The visibility of this
interference pattern is close to one for the Poisson distribution of two
condensates with equal counting rates but it becomes a stochastic variable in
the thermal case, where the visibility will vary from run to run around an
average visibility of $\pi /4.$ In both cases, the variance of the phase
distribution is inversely proportional to the number of atom detections in the
regime where this number is large compared to one but small compared with the
total number of atoms in the condensates.
