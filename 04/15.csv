hydrogen can be present in the envelope, including atom, poly-molecules, and
condensed metal. We study the physical properties of different hydrogen phases
on the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star for a wide range of field
strength $B$ and surface temperature $T$. Depending on the values of $B$ and
$T$, the outer envelope can be either in a nondegenerate gaseous phase or in a
degenerate metallic phase. For $T\go 10^5$ K and moderately strong magnetic
field, $B\lo 10^{13}$ G, the envelope is nondegenerate and the surface material
gradually transforms into a degenerate Coulomb plasma as density increases. For
higher field strength, $B>> 10^{13}$ G, there exists a first-order phase
transition from the nondegenerate gaseous phase to the condensed metallic
phase. The column density of saturated vapor above the metallic hydrogen
decreases rapidly as the magnetic field increases or/and temperature decreases.
Thus the thermal radiation can directly emerge from the degenerate metallic
hydrogen surface. The characteristics of surface X-ray/EUV emission for
different phases are discussed. A separate study concerning the possibility of
magnetic field induced nuclear fusion of hydrogen on the neutron star surface

modes of a star by the external gravitational potential of its companion.
Unlike the nonrotating case, there are difficulties with the usual mode
decomposition for rotating stars because of the asymmetry between modes
propagating in the direction of rotation and those propagating opposite to it.
For an eccentric binary system, we derive general expressions for the energy
transfer $\Delta E_s$ and the corresponding angular momentum transfer $\Delta
J_s$ in a periastron passage when there is no initial oscillation present in
the star. Except when a nearly precise orbital resonance occurs (i.e., the mode
frequency equals multiple of the orbital frequency), $\Delta E_s$ is very close
to the steady-state mode energy in the tide in the presence of dissipation. It
is shown that stellar rotation can change the strength of dynamical tide
significantly. In particular, retrograde rotation with respect to the orbit
increases the energy transfer by bringing lower-order g-modes (or f-mode for
convective stars), which couple more strongly to the tidal potential, into
closer resonances with the orbital motion of the companion.
  We apply our general formalism to the problems of tidal capture binary
formation and the orbital evolution of PSR J0045-7319/B-star binary. Stellar
rotation changes the critical impact parameter for binary capture. Although the
enhancement (by retrograde rotation) in the capture cross section is at most
$\sim 20%$, the probability that the captured system survives
disruption/merging and therefore becomes a binary can be significantly larger.
It is found that in order to explain the observed rapid orbital decay of the
PSR J0045-7319 binary system, retrograde rotation in the B-star is required.

minimum masses, and the corresponding absolute magnitudes, for the different
metallicities. We predict color-magnitude diagrams in the infrared NICMOS
filters, to be used for the next generation of the HST observations, providing
mass-magnitudes relationships in these colors down to the brown-dwarf limit. We
show that the expected signature of the stellar to substellar transition in
color-magnitude diagrams is a severe blueshift in the infrared colors, due to
the increasing collision-induced absorption of molecular hydrogen with
increasing density and decreasing temperature.

the effective mass of the wiggles. In cosmic string wakes, cool streams of
baryons collide and are trapped at the center of the wake causing an

elliptical galaxies that differs from the conventional picture in two ways:
1)Ellipticals do not form in a single monolithic collapse and burst of star
formation at high redshift. Instead, most of their stars form at modest rates
in disk galaxies, which then merge to form the ellipticals. 2)Galaxies do not
undergo closed-box chemical evolution. Instead, metals can be transferred
between the stars, cold gas and the hot gas halos of the galaxies. It is
assumed that metals are ejected out of disk galaxies during supernova
explosions and these metals enter the hot gas component. The fact that metals
are more easily ejected from small galaxies leads to the establishment of a
mass-metallicity relation for the disk systems. Big ellipticals are more metal
rich because they are formed from the mergers of bigger disks. We use
semi-analytic techniques to follow the formation, evolution, and chemical
enrichment of cluster ellipticals in a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos.
The inclusion of the new metallicity-dependent spectral synthesis models of
Bruzual & Charlot allow us to compute the colours, line indices and mass-to-
light ratios of these galaxies. If feedback is assumed to be efficient, we are
able to reproduce the slope and scatter of the colour-magnitude and the
Mg2-sigma relations. We also study the evolution of these relations to high
redshift. We show that the luminosity-metallicity relation remains fixed, but
the mean stellar ages of the galaxies scale with the age of the Universe.
Finally, we study the enrichment history of the intracluster gas. We find that
80% of the metals were ejected by low-mass galaxies at redshifts greater than
1. The metallicity of the ICM thus evolves very little out to z > 1.

morphological and photometric biases against low-redshift quasars, and about 50
% of the sample objects are at z < 0.3, spanning a range of three decades in
luminosity. While our derived space densities for low-luminosity Seyfert 1
nuclei are consistent with those found in the literature, we find that luminous
QSOs, M_B < -24, are much more numerous in the local universe than previous
surveys indicated. The optical luminosity functions of Seyfert 1 nuclei and
QSOs join smoothly, and if the host galaxy contributions are taken into
account, a single power-law of slope alpha = -2.2 describes the combined local
luminosity function adequately, over the full range in absolute magnitude.
Comparing our data with published results at higher redshifts, we can rule out
pure luminosity evolution as an acceptable parametrisation; the luminosity
function of quasars changes shape and slope with z, in the sense that the most
luminous quasars show the weakest evolution.

trigonometric parallaxes from the HIPPARCOS satellite coupled with accurate

spectroscopy for a sample of about thirty subdwarfs. Systematic effects due to
star selection (Lutz-Kelker corrections to parallaxes) and to the possible
presence of undetected binaries in the sample of bona fide single stars are
examined, and appropriate corrections are estimated. They are found to be small
for our sample. The new data allowed us to reliably define the absolute
location of the main sequence (MS) as a function of metallicity. These results
are then used to derive distances and ages for a carefully selected sample of
nine globular clusters having metallicities determined from high dispersion
spectra of individual giants according to a procedure totally consistent with
that used for the field subdwarfs. Very precise and homogeneous reddening
values have also been independently determined for these clusters. We find that
HIPPARCOS parallaxes are smaller than the corresponding ground-based
measurements leading, in turn, to longer distance moduli ($\sim 0.2$ mag) and
younger ages ($\sim 2.8$ Gyr). The relation between the zero age HB (ZAHB)

studied both classically and quantum mechanically. Starting with the Ashtekar
formulation of Lorentzian general relativity, we introduce a gauge fixing
procedure to remove almost all of the non-physical degrees of freedom. In this
way, we arrive at a reduced model that is subject only to one homogeneous
constraint. The phase space of this model is described by means of a canonical
set of elementary variables. These are two real, homogeneous variables and the
Fourier coefficients for four real fields that are periodic in the angular
coordinate which does not correspond to a Killing field of the Gowdy
spacetimes. We also obtain the explicit expressions for the line element and
reduced Hamiltonian. We then proceed to quantize the system by representing the
elementary variables as linear operators acting on a vector space of analytic
functionals. The inner product on that space is selected by imposing Lorentzian
reality conditions. We find the quantum states annihilated by the operator that
represents the homogeneous constraint of the model and construct with them the
Hilbert space of physical states. Finally, we derive the general form of the
quantum observables of the model.

both the usual (non-compact) and compact variety (""compactons""). For the
particular case that p=m=n+l, the solitary wave solutions have compact support
and the feature that their width is independent of the amplitude. We discuss
the Hamiltonian structure of these theories and find that mass, momentum, and
energy are conserved. We find in general that these are not completely
integrable systems. Numerical simulations show that an arbitrary compact
initial wave packet whose width is wider than that of a compacton breaks up
into several compactons all having the same width. The scattering of two
compactons is almost elastic, with the left over wake eventually turning into
compacton-anticompacton pairs. When there are two different compacton solutions
for a single set of parameters the wider solution is stable, and this solution
is a minimum of the Hamiltonian.

such a scenario, using an ansatz inspired by the Bravais lattice as a model for
some vacuum properties. It then turns out that: a) the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin

high-momentum unstable particles have longer lifetimes than expected with exact
