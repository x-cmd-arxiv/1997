of protostructures from tidal torques in a Friedmann Universe, as developed in
a previous paper, is extended to include non-Gaussian initial conditions. We
restrict our analysis here to a particular class of non-Gaussian primordial
distributions, namely multiplicative models. In such models, strongly
correlated phases are produced by obtaining the gravitational potential via a
nonlinear local transformation of an underlying Gaussian random field. The
dynamical evolution of the system is followed by describing the trajectories of
fluid particles using second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory. In the
Einstein-de Sitter universe, the lowest-order perturbative correction to the
variance of the linear angular momentum of collapsing structures grows as t^8/3
for generic non-Gaussian statistics, which contrasts with the t^10/3 growth
rate characteristic of Gaussian statistics. This is a consequence of the fact
that the lowest-order perturbative spin contribution in the non-Gaussian case
arises from the third moment of the gravitational potential, which is
identically zero for a Gaussian field. Evaluating these corrections at the
maximum expansion time of the collapsing structure, we find that these
non-Gaussian and non-linear terms can be as high as the linear estimate,
without the degree of non-Gaussianity as quantified by skewness and kurtosis of
the density field being unacceptably large. The results suggest that
higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion may contribute significantly
to galactic spin which contrasts with the straightforward Gaussian case.

one requires only that the non-uniform pressure parameter, $a$, in one of the

  From this comparison, we conclude that if white dwarfs do indeed constitute
more than 10% of the local halo mass density, then the Universe must be at
least 10 Gyr old for our most extreme allowed values of the parameters. When we
use cooling curves that account for chemical fractionation and more likely
values of the IMF and the bolometric correction, we find tighter limits: a
white dwarf MACHO fraction of 10% (30%) requires a minimum age of 14 Gyr (15.5

five major institutions prompts us to speculate that, after all, neutrinos may
be tachyons. There are number of reasons to believe that this could be the
case. Stationary neutrinos have not been detected. There is no evidence of
right handed neutrinos which are most likely to be observed if neutrinos can be
stationary. They have the unusual property of the mass oscillation between
flavors which has not been observed in the electron families. While Standard
Model predicts the mass of neutrinos to be zero, the observed spectrum of
Tritium decay experiments hasn't conclusively proved that the mass of neutrino
is exactly zero. Based upon these observations and other related phenomena, we
wish to argue that there are too many inconsistencies to fit neutrinos into the
category of ordinary inside light cone particles and that the simplest possible
way to resolve the mystery of the neutrino is to change our point of view and
determine that neutrinos are actually tachyons.

approach leads us to delineate fermions into eight basic families or `types',
corresponding to the eight simply connected double covering groups of the
inhomogeneous Lorentz group (the `pin' groups). Given this classification, it
is natural to ask whether or not fermion type determines a superselection rule.
It is also important to determine what observable effects fermion type might
have; for example, can the type of a given fermion be determined by laboratory
experiments? We address these questions by arguing that if multiple fermion
types really did occur in nature, then it would be mathematically equivalent
and also much simpler to think of the different types as being different states
of a {\it single} particle, which would be a particle which lived in the direct
sum of Hilbert spaces associated with the different particle types. In the
language of group theory, these are pinor supermultiplets. We discuss the
possible experimental ramifications of this proposal. In particular, following
work of J. Giesen, we show that the symmetries of the electric dipole moment of
a particle would be definitely affected by this proposal. In fact, we show that
it would be possible to use the electric dipole moment of a particle to
determine the type. We also present an argument that M-theory may provide the

  Workshop on Exciting Physics with New Accelerators Facilities (EXPAF97),
  SPring8, Aioi, Japan, March 11-13, 1997",,,,"nucl-th",,"  The \eta-meson collision with light nuclei, ^2H, ^3H, ^3He, and ^4He, is
considered on the basis of a microscopic approach which utilises Faddeev type
and Lippmann-Schwinger equations. The nuclear hamiltonian is approximated by
the finite rank approximation which amounts to the coherent approximation. The
\eta-nucleus scattering length and the resonance and bound--state poles of the
amplitude describing elastic scattering of \eta-meson by these nuclei are
obtained. For each of the nuclei considered, the minimal factor enhancing the
\eta N--attraction that moves the poles to the quasi--bound state area of the
complex k--plane, is determined. It is shown that within the existing
uncertainties in the elementary \eta N iteraction all these nuclei can support
a quasi--bound state which can result in a formation of an eta-mesic nucleus.
Various aspects of the eta-nucleus physics are discussed with specific emphasis
given to the \eta--nucleus effective interaction in configuration space
(constructed via the Marchenko inverse scattering method), to the
Okubo--Zweig--Iizuka (OZI) rule, and to the charge symmetry breaking problem.

which arises only if the initial mesic atom is aligned, proves highly sensitive

for determinating g_P may be realized for the transition 1+ to 2+ from the

orthogonal to the axis of the mesic-atom polarization and which have oppositely

of the final state is constructed by using the method of hyperspherical
harmonics. In the approximation of the allowed Gamow-Teller transition 1+ to

relative phase of reduced matrix elements for transitions from the 6-Li ground

Delta(1232)-nucleon interaction in the Delta resonance excitation energy
region. For the Delta-N potential, a meson exchange model is adopted where pi,
rho, omega, and sigma meson exchanges are taken into account. The deuteron
disintegration below and above pion threshold is calculated using a coupled
channel approach. Various observables, such as the inclusive cross section, the
quasifree Delta decay, the coherent pion production, and the two-nucleon
breakup are considered. It is shown that these observables are influenced by
the dynamical treatment of the Delta degrees of freedom. Of special interest is
the coherent pion decay of the Delta resonance which is studied by means of the
exclusive reaction 2H(p,n pi+)2H. Both the peak energy and the magnitude of the
coherent pion production cross section depend very sensitively on the strength
of the Delta-N potential. The coherent pions have a peak energy of 300 MeV and
a strongly forward peaked angular distribution.

three-dimensional convection with imposed spatial periodicity, we analyse three
examples of bifurcations from a continuous group orbit of spatio-temporally
symmetric periodic solutions of partial differential equations. Our approach is
based on centre manifold reduction for maps, and is in the spirit of earlier
work by Iooss (1986) on bifurcations of group orbits of spatially symmetric
equilibria. Two examples, two-dimensional pulsating waves (PW) and
three-dimensional alternating pulsating waves (APW), have discrete
spatio-temporal symmetries characterized by the cyclic groups Z_n, n=2 (PW) and
n=4 (APW). These symmetries force the Poincare return map M to be the nth
iterate of a map G: M=G^n. The group orbits of PW and APW are generated by
translations in the horizontal directions and correspond to a circle and a
two-torus, respectively. An instability of pulsating waves can lead to
solutions that drift along the group orbit, while bifurcations with Floquet
multiplier +1 of alternating pulsating waves do not lead to drifting solutions.
The third example we consider, alternating rolls, has the spatio-temporal
symmetry of alternating pulsating waves as well as being invariant under
reflections in two vertical planes. When the bifurcation breaks these
reflections, the map G has a ""two-symmetry"", as analysed by Lamb (1996). This
leads to a doubling of the marginal Floquet multiplier and the possibility of
bifurcation to two distinct types of drifting solutions.
