100 keV. This spectral shape in this range is similar to that found for the
continuum emission from the inner Galaxy but the amplitude is lower by a factor
of four. This emission is either due to unresolved and previously unknown point
sources or it is of diffuse origin, or a combination of the two. Simultaneous
observations with OSSE and smaller field of view instruments operating in the
soft gamma ray energy band, such as XTE or SAX, would help resolve this issue.
If it is primarily diffuse emission due to nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung,

ray electrons exceeds that of the nuclear component of the cosmic rays by an
order of magnitude. This would have profound implications for the origin of

recently found astrophysical applications in polar cap models of gamma-ray

computation of the polarization-dependent rates of this third order QED process
for arbitrary field strengths and energies below pair creation threshold is
difficult: thus early analyses focused on analytic developments and simpler
asymptotic forms. The recent astrophysical interest spurred the use of the
S-matrix approach by Mentzel, Berg and Wunner to determine splitting rates. In
this paper, we present numerical computations of a full proper-time expression
for the rate of splitting that was obtained by Stoneham, and is exact up to the
pair creation threshold. While the numerical results derived here are in accord
with the earlier asymptotic forms due to Adler, our computed rates still differ
by as much as factors of 3 from the S-matrix re-evaluation of Wilke and Wunner,
reflecting the extreme difficulty of generating accurate S-matrix numerics for
fields below about \teq{4.4\times 10^{13}}Gauss. We find that our proper-time
rates appear very accurate, and exceed Adler's asymptotic specializations
significantly only for photon energies just below pair threshold and for
supercritical fields, but always by less than a factor of around 2.6. We also
provide a useful analytic series expansion for the scattering amplitude valid
at low energies.

this method suffers from very large uncertainties in the derived lensing

propose to use the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to correct blending effects.
With the high resolving power of the HST combined with the color information

emission, often with little corresponding H alpha, indicates the presence of
many ``B-stars'', which produce mostly non-ionizing UV photons. These far-UV
photons dissociate a small fraction of an extensive layer of H_2 into HI. The
observed morphology can be understood if ``chimneys'' are common in the spiral
arms of M81, where holes are blown out of the galactic disk, exposing the
bright HII regions and the corresponding far-UV associated with vigorous star
formation. These ``naked'' star-forming regions show little obscuration. H_2 is

point groups, the possible symmetries of the superconducting phase are
classified, and the free energy is used to construct a generalized phase
diagram. We identify the leading candidate out of the possible SSS phases for
each point group. The symmetry of the superconducting phase is used to
determine the cases where the gap function has generic zeros (point or line
nodes) on the Fermi surface. Such nodes always occur, hence thermodynamic
properties will have power-law behavior at low temperature.

present several future visions demonstrating very clearly the great potential
of CP asymmetries in B-decays and of clean K-decays such as $K^+\to\pi^+\nu
\bar\nu$ and $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ in the determination of the CKM parameters
and in decisive testing of the Standard Model. An outlook for the coming years

a direct product AH\times R^4 where AH is the Atiyah-Hitchin metric for SU(2)

which corresponds to its radius and SO(3) orientation. We solve for the
long-range fields in this region, and examine the energy density and rotational
moments of inertia. The moduli space metric for these monopoles, given by
Dancer, is also expressed in a more explicit form.

infinite dimensional membrane space M is developed and an action which is
covariant under reparametrizations in M is proposed. The canonical and
Hamiltonian formalism is elaborated in detail. The quantization appears to be
straightforward and elegant. No problem with unitarity arises. The conventional
p-brane states are particular stationary solutions to the functional
Schroedinger equation which describes the evolution of a membrane's state with
respect to the invariant evolution parameter tau. A tau-dependent solution
which corresponds to the wave packet of a null p-brane is found. It is also
shown that states of a lower dimensional membrane can be considered as

Rayleigh-Benard convection and Faraday instability in viscous fluid. In both
systems spirals are observed in certain parameter regions. In the
Rayleigh-Benard convection, the spiral core instability and subsequent
generation of up- and downflow hexagons are shown to occur due to the mean flow
generated by the curved rolls near the core. In the Faraday instability, the
mean flow which is generated by rapidly decaying surface waves near the wall,
causes wavenumber frustration which leads to a rigid-body spiral rotation. In
both cases we use phenomenological Swift-Hohenberg-type equations for the order
parameter coupled to a large-scale mean flow. Numerical simulations are
compared to recently reported experimental results.

  System","22 pages with 1 figure. Postscript",,,"RFSC 96/04","physics.chem-ph",,"  A system containing a pre-steady state standard (non-autocatalytic) reaction,
with multiple paths, evolves toward a kinetic state with the minimum attainable
activation free energy. Displacement of the path frequency distribution in this
transition was shown to minimise the affinity linked to this change in
activation free energy. In damping this scalar force, a standard system is
driven along a path of least action, as previously established for a system of
competing autocatalytic reactions. A kinetic source of time asymmetry arises
within the system, as the activation affinity moves the system toward the most
probable distribution of reaction paths. As the functions of state are not
changed by path displacement, a change of kinetic state cannot produce chemical
work. This generalises the notion of force to a scalar quantity responsible for
a displacement that does not yield work or heat. Spectrophotometric
observations reported on the transition to steady state kinetics during
dinitrophenyl phosphate phosphorolysis confirmed that time variations in the
activation affinity are non-positive.
