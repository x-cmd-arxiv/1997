Comparing the BLR distances calculated from our photoionization scaling model
to the BLR distances determined by reverberation mapping shows that the scaling
law agrees with the $R\sim L^{1/2}$ empirical relation. We investigate a
complimentary method of estimating the BLR distance - based on the Keplerian

chromospherically active binary stars (CABS). Since most of these binaries have
known radii, masses and ages, this kind of data is especially useful for
comparisons with theoretical models which try to explain the Li depletion
phenomenon. We show that a significant part of these stars have clear Li
overabundances. These excesses are evident when comparing our sample of CABS
with binary and single stars belonging to open clusters of different ages,
namely Pleiades, Hyades, NGC752, M67 and NGC188. The Li excesses are more
conspicuous for masses in the range 0.75-0.95 Mo, indicating that the rate of
Li depletion has been less pronounced in CABS than in single stars. This
phenomenon is interpreted in the context of transport of angular momentum from
the orbit to the stellar rotation due to tidal effects. Other explanations,
however, can not be ruled out. This is the case of transport of material
induced by internal gravity waves, which could be inhibited due to the presence
of strong magnetic fields associated with the effective dynamo in CABS. The
confirmed existence of a relation between Li and fluxes in CaII H&K lines can
also be accommodated within both scenarios.

emission lines in 88% of our sample, and only absorption lines in the remaining
12%. Emission-line profiles are roughly Gaussian with velocity widths that
range from the measurement limit of sigma = 35 km s^-1 to 150 km s^-1.
Rest-frame [OII]3727 equivalent widths range from 5A to 94A , yielding star
formation rates (SFR) of 0.1 to 14 M yr^-1. The analysis of various line
diagnostic diagrams reveals that 60% of compact emission-line galaxies have
velocity widths, excitations, Hbeta luminosities, SFRs, and mass-to-light
ratios characteristic of young star-forming HII galaxies. The remaining 40%
form a more heterogeneous class of evolved starbursts, similar to local
starburst disk galaxies. We find that, although the compact galaxies at z>0.7
have similar SFRs per unit mass to those at z<0.7, they are on average 10 times
more massive. Our sample implies a lower limit for the global comoving SFR
density of 0.004 M yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z = 0.55, and 0.008 M yr^-1 Mpc^-3 at z =
0.85 (assuming Salpeter IMF, Ho = 50 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and qo = 0.5). These
values, when compared to estimates for a sample of local compact galaxies

distribution to the formation of selfgravitating clumps until most of the gas

yields a mean free path l that decreases as L/W^2 as W increases, L being the
linear size of the system. But this diminution ceases when the surface layer
begins to decouple from the bulk for large enough values of W, leaving more or
