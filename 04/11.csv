physical theory (a compactification of ``M-theory'') and a four-dimensional
physical theory (using the ``F-theory'' construction). A key issue in both
theories is the calculation of the ``superpotential''of the theory. We propose
a systematic approach to identify these divisors, and derive some criteria to
determine whether a given divisor indeed contributes. We then apply our
techniques in explicit examples, in particular, when the base B of the elliptic
fibration is a toric variety or a Fano 3-fold. When B is Fano, we show how
divisors contributing to the superpotential are always ""exceptional"" (in some
sense) for the Calabi-Yau 4-fold X. This naturally leads to certain transitions
of X, that is birational transformations to a singular model (where the image
of D no longer contributes) as well as certain smoothings of the singular
model. If a smoothing exists, then the Hodge numbers change. We speculate that
divisors contributing to the superpotential are always ""exceptional"" (in some
sense) for X, also in M-theory. In fact we show that this is a consequence of
the (log)-minimal model algorithm in dimension 4, which is still conjectural in
its generality, but it has been worked out in various cases, among which toric
varieties.

our method to the galaxy NGC 891, the only model that could fit the

includes a strong warp with a line of node almost coinciding with the line of

model, since orbits in the tilted planes are not circular, but elongated, with
their minor axis in the galaxy plane. Their velocity on the major axis (i.e. at
their maximal height above the plane) is then 30% less than in the plane. We
finally connect the modelled vertical outer gaseous distribution to the dark
matter through hydrodynamical and gravitational equations. Under the assumption
of isotropy of the gaseous velocity dispersion, we conclude on a very flattened

redshift of z=4.92. It is the highest redshift object currently known. A
gravitational lens model was used to reconstruct images of the high-redshift
galaxy. The reconstructed image is asymmetric, containing a bright knot and a
patch of extended emission 0.4 arcsec from the knot. The effective radius of
the bright knot is 0.022 arcsec or 130 h^-1 pc. The extended patch is partially
resolved into compact regions of star formation. The reconstructed galaxy has
I_AB= 24, giving a bolometric luminosity of about 3e11 Lsun. This can be
produced by a star formation rate of 36 h^-2 Msun /yr (q0=0.5), or by an
instantaneous star burst of 3e8 Msun. The spectral lines show velocity
variations on the order of 300 km/s along the arc. The Si II line is blue
shifted with respect to the Ly alpha emission, and the Ly alpha emission line
is asymmetric with a red tail. These spectral features are naturally explained
by an outflow model, in which the blue side of the Ly alpha line has been
absorbed by outflowing neutral H I. Evidence from other sources indicates that
outflows are common in starburst galaxies at high and low redshift. We have
discovered a companion galaxy with a radial velocity only 450 km/s different

character to, but much weaker than, the broad permitted lines that define type
1 Seyfert nuclei. One of the primary goals of the survey is to better quantify
the faint end of the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei. This paper
describes the subset of nuclei showing definite or probable evidence of broad
H-alpha emission. We outline the procedures for determining the presence of

Most of the detections are reported for the first time, and the detection rate
represents a lower limit to the true incidence of active nuclei harboring a
broad emission-line region. These statistics imply that broad-lined active
nuclei are much more common than previously believed: they exist in at least

marginal increase in the detection rate of H II nuclei and a corresponding
decrease in the incidence of AGNs. The minor differences in the detection
rates, however, are statistically insignificant, most likely stemming from
selection effects and not from a genuine influence from the bar. The presence
of a bar seems to have no noticeable impact on the likelihood of a galaxy to
host either nuclear star formation or an AGN. The nuclei of early-type barred
spirals do exhibit measurably higher star-formation rates than their unbarred
counterparts, as indicated by either the luminosity or the equivalent width of
H-alpha emission. By contrast, late-type spirals do not show such an effect.
Bars have a negligible effect on the strength of the AGNs in our sample,

optical spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies to quantify the incidence of
local (z = 0) nuclear activity. Consistent with previous studies, we find
detectable amounts of ionized gas in the central few hundred parsecs of most
(86%) galaxies. Half of the objects can be classified as H II or star-forming
nuclei and the other half as some form of AGN, of which we distinguish three
classes --- Seyfert nuclei, LINERs, and transition objects. The population of
AGNs consequently is very large; approximately 43% of the galaxies in our
survey can be regarded as ""active."" Most of the objects have much lower
luminosities than AGNs commonly studied; the median luminosity of the narrow
H-alpha line, after correcting for extinction, is only 2 x 10^39 erg/s. Our
sample therefore occupies the extreme faint end of the AGN luminosity function.
We detect signatures of a broad-line region, as revealed by visible broad
H-alpha emission, in $\sim$ 20% of the AGN sample. Seyfert nuclei, both type 1
and type 2, reside in $\sim$ 10% of all galaxies. LINERs make up the bulk
(1/2--3/4) of the AGN population and a significant fraction (1/5--1/3) of all
galaxies. A nonnegligible subset of LINERs emit broad H-alpha emission,
furnishing direct evidence that at least some LINERs are indeed related
physically to the AGN phenomenon. The dominant ionization mechanism of the
nuclear emission depends strongly on the morphological type and luminosity of
the host galaxy. AGNs are found predominantly in luminous, early-type (E to
Sbc) galaxies, while H II nuclei prefer less luminous, late-type (Sbc and
later) systems. The various AGN subclasses have broadly similar host galaxies.

to the $B-\bar B$ mixing amplitude. This allows a model independent
construction of the CKM Unitarity Triangle (up to hadronic uncertainties).
Furthermore, the contributions to the mixing from the Standard Model and from
the new physics can be disentangled. A serious obstacle to this analysis is an
eightfold discrete ambiguity in solving for the angles of the triangle. Several
ways to reduce the ambiguity either by making further measurements, or by
making further assumptions about the nature of the new physics are described.

subject to a uniform axial electric field are investigated. The plasma is
maintained by an external ionizing source balanced by bulk and surface
recombinations. Collisions between neutrals, whose density greatly exceeds the
density of charged particles, and of neutrals with ions are sufficiently
effective for their velocity distribution to be close to a Maxwellian with the
same uniform temperature, independent of the external field. The behavior of
the plasma is described by a collisional two-fluid scheme with charge
neutrality in the interior of the tube. Approximate nonlinear equations for the
hydrodynamical moments are obtained from a Boltzmann equation in which
electron-neutral, electron-ion and electron-electron collisions are all
important. It is found that under certain circumstances the current, and the
temperature of the electrons undergo a drastic change, with hysteresis, as the
electric field is varied.

and control of the turbulent transport of heat in present-day tokamak fusion
experiments. Recent developments in numerical methods along with enormous gains
in computing power have made large-scale simulations an important tool for
improving our understanding of this phenomena. Simulating this highly
non-linear behavior requires solving for the perturbations of the phase space
distribution function in five dimensions. We use a particle-in-cell approach to
solve the equations. The code has been parallelized for a variety of
architectures (C90, CM-5, T3D) using a 1-D domain decomposition along the
toroidal axis, for which the number of particles in each cell remains
approximately constant. The quasi-uniform distribution of particles, which
minimizes load imbalance, coupled with the relatively small movement of
particles across cells, which minimizes communications, makes this problem
ideally suited to massively parallel architectures. We present the performance
of the program for different numbers of processors and problem sizes. In
addition, we discuss some recent scientific results obtained from the code.
