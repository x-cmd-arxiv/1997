dynamical simulations to explain such a segregation by dependence of the

mass captured into the ring during an encounter of a host-ring system with a

referred to as the ``Nernst theorem'') asserts that the entropy, $S$, of a
system must go to zero (or a ``universal constant'') as its temperature, $T$,
goes to zero. This assertion is commonly considered to be a fundamental law of
thermodynamics. As such, it seems to spoil the otherwise perfect analogy
between the ordinary laws of thermodynamics and the laws of black hole
mechanics, since rotating black holes in general relativity do not satisfy the
analog of the ``Nernst theorem''. The main purpose of this paper is to attempt
to lay to rest the ``Nernst theorem'' as a law of thermodynamics. We consider a
boson (or fermion) ideal gas with its total angular momentum, $J$, as an
additional state parameter, and we analyze the conditions on the single
particle density of states, $g(\epsilon,j)$, needed for the Nernst formulation
of the third law to hold. (Here, $\epsilon$ and $j$ denote the single particle
energy and angular momentum.) Although it is shown that the Nernst formulation
of the third law does indeed hold under a wide range of conditions, some simple
classes of examples of densities of states which violate the ``Nernst theorem''
are given. In particular, at zero temperature, a boson (or fermion) gas
confined to a circular string (whose energy is proportional to its length) not

Final-State Interactions (FSI) in homogeneous nuclear matter, as the residual
nucleus can be described to a first approximation when dealing with very fast
emitted protons. The main advantage of the present method is that in the
framework of the Distorted-Wave Impulse Approximation (DWIA) it allows for an
analytical derivation of all the components of the nuclear response. It emerges
that cancellations among the leading contributions determine the very small
absolute size of the socalled fifth structure function and produce a nontrivial
asymptotic scaling of the related helicity asymmetry for large values of the

well understood in two physically distinct models, namely a static thermal
hadronic source vs.~a time-dependent, nonequilibrium hadronization off a
quark-gluon plasma droplet. Due to the time-dependent particle evaporation off
the hadronic surface in the latter approach the hadron ratios change (by
factors of $<\approx 5$) in time. Final particle yields reflect time averages
over the actual thermodynamic properties of the system at a certain stage of
the evolution. Calculated hadron, strangelet and (anti-)cluster yields as well
as freeze-out times are presented for different systems. Due to strangeness
distillation the system moves rapidly out of the T, $\mu_q$ plane into the
$\mu_s$-sector. Strangeness to baryon ratios f_s=1-2 prevail during a
considerable fraction (50%) of the time evolution (i.e. $\Lambda$-droplets or
even $\Xi^-$-droplets form the system at the late stage: The possibility of
observing this time evolution via HBT correlations is discussed). The observed
hadron ratios require $T_c\approx 160 MeV$ and $B^{1/4}>\approx 200 MeV$. If
the present model is fit to the extrapolated hadron yields, metastable
hypermatter can only be produced with a probability $p< 10^{-8}$ for $A \ge 4$.
