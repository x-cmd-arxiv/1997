helium abundance may be nearly unchanged but the oxygen abundance could have
been seriously underestimated. For hotter, mainly low-metallicity HII regions
the oxygen abundance is likely accurate but the helium abundance could be
underestimated. The net effect is to tilt the Y vs. Z relation, making it
flatter and resulting in a higher inferred Y_P. Although this effect could be
large, there are no data which allow us to estimate the size of the temperature
fluctuations for the extragalactic HII regions. Therefore, we have explored
this effect via Monte Carlos in which the abundances derived from a fiducial

< \Delta-T_max where \Delta-T_max is varied from 500K to 4000K. It is

nebulae around stars of different mass. Because a more massive central star
evolves much faster than a lower mass one, it is to be expected that this will
affect the formation of the PN. For the stars I use the evolutionary tracks for
remnants with masses of 0.605 M0 and 0.836 M0, taken from Bloecker (1995). The
AGB wind is assumed to be concentrated in a thin disk, which in models without
evolving stars leads to the formation of a bipolar nebula. I find that in the
case of the 0.836 M0 remnant the nebula indeed acquires a bipolar shape,
whereas for the 0.605 M0 remnant the shape is more elliptical. The reason for
this is the time it takes to ionize the AGB material; if this happens
sufficiently slowly the density distribution in the AGB wind will be smoothed
out, leading to more elliptical shapes. If it happens quickly, the original
density distribution (in this case a thin disk) is hardly affected. This result
suggests that lower mass central stars will less easily produce bipolar
nebulae, which is supported by observations.

off-resonance current, there are two kinds of resonant behavior; (i) a current
independent of the barrier transparency (true resonance) and (ii) a current
analogous to the one for a ring with only a single barrier
(``semi''-resonance). For a given barrier transparency one or the other type of
resonant behavior is realized depending on a geometric factor (ratio of
interbarrier distance to ring circumference) and on the strength of the
electron-electron interaction. It is shown that a repulsive interaction favours
the``semi''-resonance behavior. For a small barrier transparency the
``semi''-resonance peaks are easily washed out by temperature whereas the true
resonance peaks survive.

the latter (quaternionic 2 by 2). Multivector reformulations of Dirac theory by
various authors look quite inequivalent pending the algebra assumed. It is not
clear if this is mere artifact, or if there is a right/wrong choice as to which

The broader question is that if the universe is signature blind, then perhaps a
complete theory should be manifestly tilt covariant. A generalized multivector
wave equation is proposed which is fully signature invariant in form, because
it includes all the components of the algebra in the wavefunction (instead of
restricting it to half) as well as all the possibilities for interaction terms.

"math/9704206","Olivier Lessmann","Olivier Lessmann","Ranks and pregeometries in finite diagrams",,,,"Logic E-prints April 17, 1997","math.LO",,"  The study of classes of models of a finite diagram was initiated by S. Shelah
in 1969. A diagram D is a set of types over the empty set, and the class of
models of the diagram D consists of the models of T which omit all the types
not in D.
  In this work, we introduce a natural dependence relation on the subsets of
the models for the omega-stable case which share many of the formal properties
of forking. This is achieved by considering a rank for this framework which is
bounded when the diagram D is omega-stable. We can also obtain pregeometries
with respect to this dependence relation. The dependence relation is the
natural one induced by the rank, and the pregeometries exist on the set of
realizations of types of minimal rank. Finally, these concepts are used to
generalize many of the classical results for models of a totally transcendental
first-order theory. In fact, strong analogies arise: models are determined by
their pregeometries or their relationship with their pregeometries; however the
proofs are different, as we do not have compactness. This is illustrated with
positive results (categoricity) as well as negative results (construction of
nonisomorphic models).

follows:
  If a compact complex surface $X$ is not ""among the known ones"" then for every
domain $\Omega $ in a Stein surface every meromorphic mapping $f:\Omega \to X$
is in fact holomorphic and extends as a holomorphic mapping $\hat f:\hat D\to

significantly their multipole strengths, widths and positions in energy. In

energies, the interference between the doorway states leads to a restructuring

form of discrete breathers. These solutions are time-periodic and (typically
exponentially) localized in space. The lattices exhibit discrete translational
symmetry. Discrete breathers are not confined to certain lattice dimensions.
Necessary ingredients for their occurence are the existence of upper bounds on
the phonon spectrum (of small fluctuations around the groundstate) of the
system as well as the nonlinearity in the differential equations. We will
present existence proofs, formulate necessary existence conditions, and discuss
structural stability of discrete breathers. The following results will be also
discussed: the creation of breathers through tangent bifurcation of band edge
plane waves; dynamical stability; details of the spatial decay; numerical
methods of obtaining breathers; interaction of breathers with phonons and
electrons; movability; influence of the lattice dimension on discrete breather
properties; quantum lattices - quantum breathers. Finally we will formulate a
new conceptual aproach capable of predicting whether discrete breather exist
for a given system or not, without actually solving for the breather. We
discuss potential applications in lattice dynamics of solids (especially
molecular crystals), selective bond excitations in large molecules, dynamical
properties of coupled arrays of Josephson junctions, and localization of
electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals with nonlinear response.

  Theory","68 pages, RevTeX, 3 figures. PSNUP -2 strongly recommended",,,"ALBERTA-THY-04-97, UCSB-TH-95-10","quant-ph gr-qc",,"  The geometry of decoherence in generalized ""consistent histories"" quantum
theory is explored, revealing properties of the theory that are independent of
any particular application of it. It is shown how the decoherence functional of
a closed quantum system may be regarded as an Hermitian form on the space of
linear operators on the Hilbert space of the system. This identification makes
manifest a number of structural properties of decoherence functionals. For
example, a bound on the maximum number of histories in a consistent set is
determined. When the decoherence functional is positive -- as in conventional
quantum mechanics -- it defines a semi-inner product on the space of history
operators. This shows that consistent sets of histories are just orthogonal
sets in this inner product. It further implies the existence in general of
Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities for positive decoherence functionals.
The geometrical significance of the ILS theorem classifying all possible
decoherence functionals is illuminated, and a version of the ILS theorem for
decoherence functionals on class operators is given. The class of history
operators consistent according to a given decoherence functional is found, and,
conversely, it is shown how to construct the decoherence functionals according
to which a given set of histories is consistent. More generally, the
""geometric"" point of view here developed supplies a powerful unified language
with which to solve problems in generalized quantum theory.
