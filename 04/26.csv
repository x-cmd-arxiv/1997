choosing suitable contours of constant probability density. We give the results

iterative multigrid solver for the gravity. The grid is a time dependent field,
whose motion is described by a generalized potential flow. Approximately
constant mass per cell can be obtained, providing all the advantages of a
Lagrangian scheme. The grid deformation combined with appropriate limiting and
smoothing schemes guarantees a regular and well behaved grid geometry, where
nearest neighbor relationships remain constant. The full hydrodynamic fluid
equations are implemented in the curvilinear moving grid, allowing for
arbitrary fluid flow relative to the grid geometry. This combination retains
all the advantages of the grid based schemes including high speed per fluid

  The current implementation is described, and empirical simulation results are
