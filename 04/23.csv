dissociation rate of H$_2$ within such clouds was computed using a 26-ray
approximation to model the attenuation of the incident ultraviolet radiation
field by dust and by H$_2$ line absorption. We have applied our modeling
technique to the isolated diffuse cloud G236+39, assuming that the cloud has a
constant density and that the thickness of the cloud along the line of sight is
at every point proportional to the 100 um continuum intensity measured by IRAS.
We find that our model can successfully account for observed variations in the
ratio of 100 umu continuum intensity to HI column density, with larger values
of that ratio occurring along lines of sight in which the molecular hydrogen
fraction is expected to be largest. Using a standard chi^2 analysis to assess
the goodness of fit of our models, we find (at the 60sigma level) that a

expanding universe, based on the nonlinear scaling relations (NSR) which
connect the nonlinear and linear two point correlation functions. The existence
of critical indices for the NSR suggests that the evolution may proceed towards
a universal profile which does not change its shape at late times. We begin by
clarifying the relation between the density profiles of the individual halo and
the slope of the correlation function and discuss the conditions under which
the slopes of the correlation function at the extreme nonlinear end can be
independent of the initial power spectrum. If the evolution should lead to a
profile which preserves the shape at late times, then the correlation function
should grow as $a^2$ [in a $\Omega=1$ universe] een at nonlinear scales. We
prove that such exact solutions do not exist; however, ther e exists a class of
solutions (``psuedo-linear profiles'', PLP's for short) which evolve as $a^2$
to a good approximation. It turns out that the PLP's are the correlation
functions which arise if the individual halos are assumed to be isothermal
spheres. They are also configurations of mass in which the nonlinear effects of
gravitational clustering is a minimum and hence can act as building blocks of
the nonlinear universe. We discuss the implicatios of this result.

emanating from the pulsar. We here present an alternative view of the nature of
this feature, namely that it consists of material from very deep inside the
exploding star, close to the mass cut between material that became part of the
neutron star and ejected material. The initial radial velocity of the inner
material was lower than the bulk of the ejecta, and formed a bubble of slow
material that started expanding again due to heating by the young pulsar's
spindown energy. The expansion is mainly in one direction, and to explain this
we speculate that the pre-supernova system was a binary. The explosion caused
the binary to unbind, and the pulsar's former companion carved a lower-density
channel into the main ejecta. The resulting puncture of the bubble's edge
greatly facilitated expansion along its path relative to other directions. If
this is the case, we can estimate the current speed of the former binary
companion and from this reconstruct the presupernova binary orbit. It follows
that the exploding star was a helium star, hence that the supernova was of type
Ib. Since the most likely binary companion is another neutron star, the
evolution of the Vela remnant and its surroundings has been rather more
complicated than the simple expansion of one supernova blast wave into
unperturbed interstellar material.

undergo the gravonuclear instabilities previously found in some He burning

evolutionary scenario, we investigate the expected pulsational behavior of He
burning SMR stars for suitable assumptions on the pulsators evolutionary
parameters. Nonlinear, nonlocal, and time-dependent convective models are
discussed, the modal stability is investigated for the first two modes, and the
theoretical predictions about the period distribution inside the instability
strip and the shape of both light and velocity curves are presented. Full
amplitude, nonlinear envelope models show that the range of effective
temperatures where SMR RR Lyrae variables present a stable limit cycle is
smaller in comparison with pulsators characterized by lower metal abundances.
We show that both periods and light curves of different groups of type II
Cepheids with periods shorter than six days, presented by Diethelm (1983,1990),
can be all reproduced by suitable variations in the effective temperature or in
the luminosity level of our SMR post-HB models, supporting evidence of a

years of data provides new insights in the behaviour of this Z source. We
confirm the previously observed recurrent patterns of behaviour in the X-ray
colour-colour and hardness-intensity diagrams (HIDs) consisting of shifts and
shape changes in the Z track. The source behaviour is correlated with overall
intensity. When the overall intensity increases, the mean velocity of the
motion along the normal branch (NB) of the Z track increase, as well as the
width of the NB in the HID. Contrary to previous results we find that, during
different observations, when the source is at the same position in the NB of
the Z track the rapid X-ray variability differs significantly. During the
Kuulkers et al. (1996) ``medium'' level, a normal branch quasi-periodic
oscillation (QPO) is detected, which is not seen during the ``high'' overall
intensity level. During the high overall intensity level episodes the very-low
frequency noise on the lower NB is very strong, whereas during the medium
overall intensity level episodes this noise component at the same position in
the Z track is much weaker. The explanation of the different overall intensity
levels with a precessing accretion disk is difficult to reconcile with our
data. Furthermore, the frequency of the horizontal branch QPO decreases when
Cyg X-2 enters the upper NB, giving a model dependent upper limit on the
magnetic field strength at the magnetic equator of ~8.5x10^9 G. We also report
5 bursts, with durations of ~5 s, whose occurrence are uncorrelated with
location in the Z track, overall intensity level or orbital phase. The burst
properties indicate that they are not regular type I bursts.

  submitted to Phys. Rev. C",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.57.448",,"nucl-th",,"  Within the relativistic PWIA, spin observables have been recalculated for
quasielastic ($\vec p,\vec p '$) and ($\vec p,\vec n$) reactions on a $^{40}$Ca
target. The incident proton energy ranges from 135 to 300 MeV while the
transferred momentum is kept fixed at 1.97 fm^{-1}. In the present
calculations, new Horowitz-Love--Franey relativistic NN amplitudes have been
generated in order to yield improved and more quantitative spin observable
values than before. The sensitivities of the various spin observables to the NN
interaction parameters, such as (1) the presence of the surrounding nuclear
medium, (2) a pseudoscalar versus a pseudovector interaction term, and (3)
exchange effects, point to spin observables which should preferably be measured
at certain laboratory proton energies, in order to test current nuclear models.
This study also shows that nuclear medium effects become more important at
lower proton energies ($\leq$ 200 MeV). A comparison to the limited available
data indicates that the relativistic parametrization of the NN scattering
amplitudes in terms of only the five Fermi invariants (the SVPAT form) is
questionable.

thoroughly investigated at the quasielastic peak for squared momentum transfers
up to $2 (GeV/c)^2$, within the plane wave impulse approximation. Great
emphasys is put on the effects in the bound-state due to different two- and
three-body nuclear forces, and to the Coulomb interaction as well. A careful
analysis of the polarized responses allows to select possible experiments for
minimizing the model dependence in the extraction of the neutron
electromagnetic form factors. In particular, the relevant role played by the
proton in the transverse-longitudinal response of polarized $^{3}$He, at low
momentum transfer, can be utilized for obtaining valuable information on the
proton contribution to the total polarized response and eventually on the
neutron charge form factor.

derivation of a general form of thermal quasi-free state and give conditions
when such state is stochastically positive i.e. when it defines periodic
stochastic process with respect to Euclidean time, so called thermal process.
Then we show that thermal process completely determines modular structure
canonically associated with quasi-free state on Weyl algebra. We discuss a
variety of examples connected with free field theories on globally hyperbolic
stationary space-times and models of quantum statistical mechanics.
