from the parabolic form of newtonian fluids is found to be characterized solely
by ratio of maximal velocity at the center to the average velocity, though the
ratio depends on the model parameters in a complex manner. We also find that
the maximal velocity ($u_{max}$) at the center is a linear function of the
driving force (g) as $u_{max} = \alpha g - \delta$ with non-zero $\delta$ in
contrast with newtonian fluids. Regarding density profiles, we observe that
densities near the boundaries are higher than those in the center. The width of
higher densities (above the average density) relative to the channel width is a
decreasing function of a variable which scales with the driving force (g),
energy dissipation parameter ($\epsilon$) and the width of the system (L) as
$g^{\mu} L^{\nu}/\epsilon$ with exponents $\mu = 1.4 \pm 0.1$ and $\nu = 0.5

metal-insulator transition at half filling and gives rise to a new vanishing
``Kondo'' scale causing breakdown of weak-coupling perturbation theory. To
describe the critical behavior at the metal-insulator transition a novel,
self-consistent diagrammatic technique with two-particle Green functions is
developed. The theory is based on the linked-cluster expansion for the
thermodynamic potential with electron-electron interaction as propagator.
Parquet diagrams with a generating functional are derived. Numerical
instabilities due to the metal-insulator transition are demonstrated on
simplifications of the parquet algebra with ring and ladder series only. A
stable numerical solution in the critical region is reached by factorization of
singular terms via a low-frequency expansion in the vertex function. We stress
the necessity for dynamical vertex renormalizations, missing in the simple
approximations, in order to describe the critical, strong-coupling behavior
correctly. We propose a simplification of the full parquet approximation by
keeping only most divergent terms in the asymptotic strong-coupling region. A
qualitatively new, feasible approximation suitable for the description of a
transition from weak to strong coupling is obtained.

close together: Each star's central density increases by an amount proportional
to 1/(orbital radius). This overwhelms any stabilizing effects of tidal
coupling [which are proportional to 1/(orbital radius)^6] and causes the stars
to collapse before they merge. Since the claimed increase of density scales
with the stars' mass, it should also show up in a perturbation limit where a
point particle of mass $\mu$ orbits a neutron star. We prove analytically that
this does not happen; the neutron star's central density is unaffected by the

version (Einstein, 1915) or as a field theory (Feynman, 1962). In the Feynman
presentation of Einstein theory an hypothesis concerning the interaction of
gravity to gravity, which was hidden in the original version, becomes explicit.
This is nothing but the assumed extension of the validity of the equivalence
principle not only for matter-gravity interaction, but also for
gravity-gravity. Recently we have presented a field theory of gravity (from
here on called the NDL theory) which does not contain such a hypothesis. We
have shown that, for this theory, both the cosmological structure and the PPN
approximation for the solar tests are satisfied.
  The proposal of this paper is to go one step further and to show that NDL
theory is able to solve the problem of radiation emission by a binary pulsar in
the same degree of accuracy as it was done in the GR theory. In the
post-Newtonian order of approximation we show that the quadrupole formula of
this theory is equal to the corresponding one in general relativity. Thus, the
unique actual observable distinction of these theories concerns the velocity of
gravitational waves, which becomes then the true ultimate test for gravity
theory.

$\theta$-angle of QCD. We show that these parameters can be interpreted in
terms of geon properties. We also find that, for certain values of the
parameters, the geons exhibit new patterns of particle identity together with
new types of statistics. Geon indistinguishability in such a case is expressed
by a proper subgroup of the permutation group and geon statistics by a
(possibly projective) representation of the subgroup.

the subclass of Boolean spaces. For each ordinal $alpha$ and pair $(K,L)$ of
subclasses of $CH$, we define $Lev_{>=alpha}(K,L)$, the class of maps of level
at least $alpha$ from spaces in $K$ to spaces in $L$, in such a way that, when
$alpha < omega$, $Lev}_{>=alpha}(BS,BS)$ consists of the Stone duals of Boolean
lattice embeddings that preserve all prenex first-order formulas of quantifier
rank $alpha$. Maps of level $>=0$ are just the continuous surjections, and the
maps of level $>=1$ are the co-existential maps. Co-elementary maps are of
level $>=alpha$ for all ordinals $alpha$; of course in the Boolean context, the
co-elementary maps coincide with the maps of level $>=omega$. The results of
this paper include:
  (i) every map of level $>=omega$ is co-elementary;
  (ii) the limit maps of an $omega$-indexed inverse system of maps of level
$>=alpha$ are also of level $>=alpha$; and
  (iii) if $K$ is a co-elementary class, $k < omega$ and $Lev_{>=k}(K,K) =
Lev_{>=k+1}(K,K)$, then $Lev_{>=k}(K,K}) = Lev_{>=omega}(K,K)$.
  A space $X$ in $K$ is co-existentially closed in $K$ if $Lev_{>=0}(K,{X}) =
Lev_{>=1}(K,{X})$. We showed in an earlier paper that every infinite member of
a co-inductive co-elementary class (such as $CH$ itself, $BS$, or the class
$CON$ of continua) is a continuous image of a space of the same weight that is
co-existentially closed in that class. We show here that every compactum that
is co-existentially closed in $CON$ (a ""co-existentially closed continuum"") is
both indecomposable and of covering dimension one.

$\delta_\alpha (X)$ measures the equivalence between all normalized block bases
$(y_i)_{i=1}^k$ of $(x_i)$ which are $S_\alpha$-admissible with respect to
$(x_i)$ ($S_\alpha$ is the $\alpha^{th}$-Schreier class of sets) and the unit
vector basis of $\ell_1^k$. This leads to the concept of the delta spectrum of
$X$, $\Delta (X)$, which reflects the behavior of stabilized limits of
$\delta_\alpha (X)$. The analogues of these constants under all renormings of
$X$ are also defined and studied. We investigate $\Delta (X)$ both in general
and for spaces of bounded distortion. We also prove several results on
distorting the classical Tsirelson's space $T$ and its relatives.

on the correlations induced by excitation modes at low energies described
within a model-space of shell-model configurations including states up to the

missing energies are presented and compared with the most recent experimental

section derived in DWIA shows an enhancement at high missing momenta as
compared to the PWIA result. Furthermore the cross sections for the $s$- and

low missing momenta. Also in these cases, which cannot be described in a model
without correlations, a good agreement with the experiment is obtained.

horizontally vibrated granular materials. As the acceleration increases above
certain value, the top layer of granular material liquefies, while the
remainder of the layer moves with the shaker in solid body motion. With
increasing acceleration, more of the layer becomes fluidized. The initial
bifurcation is backward, and the amount of hysteresis depends mainly on
frictional properties of the granular media. A small amount of fluidization by
gas flow lifts the hysteresis. Modest differences in the frictional properties
of otherwise identical particles leads to rapid segregation.

power in new hybrid models of nonlinear coherent couplers consisting of optical
slab waveguides with various orders of nonlinearity. The first model consists
of two guides with second-order instead of the usual third-order
susceptibilities as typified by the Jensen coupler. This second-order system is
shown to have a power self-trapping transition at a critical power greater than
the third-order susceptibility coupler. Next, we consider a mixed coupler
composed of a second-order guide coupled to a third-order guide and show that,
although it does not display a rigorous self-trapping transition, for a
particular choice of parameters it does show a fairly abrupt trapping of power
at a lower power than in the third-order coupler. By coupling this mixed
nonlinear pair to a third, purely linear guide, the power trapping can be
brought to even lower levels and in this way a satisfactory switching profile
can be achieved at less than one sixth the input power needed in the Jensen
coupler.
