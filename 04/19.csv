high signal-to-noise data from the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I 10-m
telescope. The results are used to study the evolution of these clouds in the
interval 2.1 < z < 3.5. We find: 1) The differential density distribution of
forest clouds, f(N_HI), fits an empirical power law with a typical slope of
-1.35 to -1.55 for clouds with N_HI < 10^14.3 cm^{-2} and changes extremely
slowly with redshift over this N_HI range. 2) The deviation of f(N_HI) from
this power-law distribution at higher column densities depends on redshift: for
higher redshifts, the departure from a power-law distribution occurs at higher
N_HI, which means that higher column density clouds rapidly disappear with
decreasing redshift. This may be consistent with an invariant shape for the
different column density distributions, but with a shift to a lower column
density normalization for systems at different redshifts driven by the overall
expansion of the universe. 3) The line widths of the forest clouds increase as
redshift decreases. 4) The correlation strength of the forest clouds seems to
increase as redshift decreases. We discuss these results in terms of the
evolution of the IGM comparing the results to models and analytic descriptions
of the evolution of structure in the gas.

years of this study and other low-latitude spots which come and go on
relatively short timescales. The polar spot has variable protuberances which
look very similar to the time-variable vertical extensions of the Sun's polar
coronal hole. The area of the polar spot and its extensions shows marginal
evidence of being periodically variable in time with a period of ~3 years. On
several occasions, isolated prominent spots emerged and then disappeared near
the equator. The tracks of two long-lived spots suggest that some spots which
emerge at low or intermediate latitudes migrate up to the pole in a clockwise
spiral (slower than the orbit), and then apparently merge with the polar spot.
Differential rotation as measured from spot movements showed that intermediate
and low latitudes rotate slightly slower than the orbital angular velocity,
while the pole and highest latitudes appear to be synchronized to the orbit.
The differential rotation is of opposite sign and a factor of 50 less than for
the Sun. We propose that the starspots on HR 1099 and other rapidly rotating RS
CVn stars are, by analogy with solar coronal holes, large unipolar magnetic
regions tightly frozen into multi-kilogauss axisymmetric dipole fields in these
stars. Since the large cool polar spots, the signature of these dipoles, are
not present on more slowly rotating RS CVn stars, we believe that they must be
dynamo-induced rather than remnant fossil fields.

Virgo cluster determined by the H_0 Key Project using M100, and consequently on
the derived value of H_0. Malmquist bias is a volume-induced statistical effect
which causes the most probable distance to be different from the raw distance
measured. Consideration of the bias in the distance to the Virgo cluster raises
this distance and lowers the calculated value of H_0. Monte Carlo simulations
of the cluster have been run for several possible distributions of spirals
within the cluster and of clusters in the local universe. Simulations
consistent with known information regarding the cluster and the errors of
measurement result in a bias of about 6.5%-8.5%. This corresponds to an
unbiased distance of 17.2-17.4 Mpc and a value of H_0 in the range 80-82
km/s/Mpc.
  The problem of determining the bias to Virgo illustrates several key points
regarding Malmquist bias. Essentially all conventional astronomical distance
measurements are subject to this bias. In addition, the bias accumulates when
an attempt is made to construct ""distance ladders"" from measurements which are
individually biased. As will be shown in the case of Virgo, the magnitude and
direction of the bias are sensitive to the spatial distribution of the parent
poputation from which the observed object is drawn - a distribution which is
often poorly known. This leads to uncertainty in the magnitude of the bias, and
adds to the importance of minimizing the number of steps in ""distance ladders"".

well-defined X-ray flare (x2 increase in 1/2 d, with similar decay) followed by
a broader, lower amplitude EUV flare ~1 day later, and a broad, low-amplitude
UV flare ~2 d later (amplitude ~35%, duration >2 d). In the preceding week
there was at least one X-ray flare of comparable amplitude or perhaps ongoing
stochastic X-ray variations. An extremely rapid change in UV flux was seen at
the beginning of the IUE observation. Assuming the central X-ray, EUV, and UV
events are associated, the lags, the decrease of amplitude with wavelength, and
the broadening of the temporal profile with wavelength are all qualitatively as
expected for synchrotron emission from an inhomogeneous relativistic jet. We
can rule out a Fermi-type shock acceleration event or a pair cascade in a
homogeneous synchrotron-emitting region. A homogeneous region is still possible
if there was an instantaneous (t<<hours) injection of high energy electrons
that emit first at X-ray energies. Alternatively, the data are consistent with
a compression wave or other disturbance crossing a region with stratified
particle energy distributions (e.g., behind a shock front and/or in an
inhomogeneous jet). The present light curves are in sharp contrast to November
1991, when the amplitude was wavelength independent and the UV lagged the
X-rays by less than ~3 hours. This means that the origin of rapid
multiwavelength variability in this blazar is complex, involving at least two
different modes. (abbreviated abstract)

dust as a source into canonical gravity. Null dust is a generalized Lagrangian
system which is described by six Clebsch potentials of its four-velocity Pfaff
form. The Dirac--ADM decomposition splits these into three canonical
coordinates (the comoving coordinates of the dust) and their conjugate momenta
(appropriate projections of four-velocity). Unlike ordinary dust of massive
particles, null dust therefore has three rather than four degrees of freedom
per space point. These are evolved by a Hamiltonian which is a linear
combination of energy and momentum densities of the dust. The energy density is
the norm of the momentum density with respect to the spatial metric. The
coupling to geometry is achieved by adding these densities to the gravitational
super-Hamiltonian and supermomentum. This leads to appropriate Hamiltonian and
momentum constraints in the phase space of the system. The constraints can be
rewritten in two alternative forms in which they generate a true Lie algebra.
The Dirac constraint quantization of the system is formally accomplished by
imposing the new constraints as quantum operator restrictions on state
functionals. We compare the canonical schemes for null and ordinary dust and
emhasize their differences.

of the Hamiltonian equations of motion into the solutions of the same
equations. It is proved that second-class constraints do not contribute to the
transformation law of the local symmetry entirely stipulated by all the
first-class constraints (and only by them) of an equivalent set passing to
which from the initial constraint set is always possible and is presented. A
mechanism of occurrence of higher derivatives of coordinates and group
parameters in the symmetry transformation law in the Noether second theorem is
elucidated. In the latter case it is shown that the obtained transformations of

thereby shown in the general case that the degeneracy of theories with the

based on a simple differential equation of motion, predicted quite well the
records of the day. One of its shortcoming is that it neglects to account for a
sprinter's energy loss around a curve, a most important consideration
particularly in the 200m--400m. An extension to Keller's work is considered,
modeling the aforementioned energy loss as a simple function of the centrifugal
force acting on the runner around the curve. Theoretical World Record
performances for indoor and outdoor 200m are discussed, and the use of the
model at 300m is investigated. Some predictions are made for possible 200m
outdoor and indoor times as run by Canadian 100m WR holder Donovan Bailey,
based on his 100m final performance at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.

operators between ""Fock-type"" modules over the Virasoro algebra. The
intertwiners are obtained via contour integration of certain ""screening
operators"" over top homology classes of a configuration space. The main
observation of the present paper is that the screening operators contain more
information. Specifically, at the chain level, the screening operators provide
a certain canonical cocycle of the Virasoro (resp. affine Kac-Moody) algebra
with coefficients in the de Rham complex of an operator-valued local system on
the configuration space. This way we obtain canonical morphisms from higher
homology groups of the above local systems to appropriate higher Ext-groups
between the Fock space representations. Our construction is motivated by, and
in a special case reduces to the construction of Bowknegt et al, see [BMP1],
[BMP2].
