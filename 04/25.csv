less non-thermal electrons than the latter. Slow shocks can produce the
required non-thermal electron spectrum for CI flares by Fermi acceleration if
electrons are injected with large enough energies to resonate with scattering
waves. The dissipation region may provide the injection electrons, so the
overall number of non-thermal electrons reaching the footpoints would depend on
the size of the dissipation region and its distance from the chromosphere. In
this picture, the LDE flares have converging inflows toward a dissipation
region that spans a smaller overall length fraction than for CI flares. Bright
loop-top X-ray spots in some CI flares can be attributed to particle trapping
at fast shocks in the downstream flow, the presence of which is determined by
the angle of the inflow field and velocity to the slow shocks.

rotation measure ($\RM$) measurements for extragalactic sources and the
cosmological magnetic field power spectrum. It is shown that the amplitude and
shape of the cosmological magnetic field power spectrum can be constrained by
using a few hundred radio sources, for which Faraday $\RM$s are available. This
constraint is of the form $B_{rms} \simless 1 \times [2.6\times10^{-7} cm^{-3}/
\bar n_b] h $ nano-Gauss (nG) on $\sim 10-50 \hmpc$ scales. The constraint is
superior to and supersedes any other constraint which come from either CMB
fluctuations, Baryonic nucleosyn thesis, or the first two multipoles of the
magnetic field expansion. Demonstration of the ability to detect such magnetic
fields, using Bayesian statistics, is carried out by constructing simulations
of the field and mimicking observations. This procedure also provides error
estimates for the derived quantities.
  The two main noise contributions due to the Galactic RM and the internal RM
are treated in a statistical way. For power indices -1\leq n \leq 1 in a flat
cosmology (Omega_m=1) we estimate the signal-to-noise ratio, Q, for limits on
the magnetic field B_{rms} on ~50 h^{-1}Mpc scale. Employing one patch of a few
square degrees on the sky with source number density n_{src}, an approximate
estimate yields Q\simeq 3 \times (B_{rms}/1 {nG})(n_{src}/50 {deg}^{-2})
(2.6\times10^{-7} {cm}^{-3}/ \bar n_b) h $. An all sky coverage, with much
sparser, but carefully tailored sample of ~500 sources, yields Q \simeq 1 with
the same scaling. An ideal combination of small densely sampled patches and
sparse all-sky coverage yields Q\simeq 3 with better constraints for the power
index. All of these estimates are corroborated by the simulations.

concentrate slightly toward the Galactic plane and center, suggesting that at
least some bursts originate within the Galaxy. To develop an interpretation of
this brightness-dependent anisotropy, we consider GRBs distributed in a thick
disk centered on the Galaxy. As an approximation to the true luminosity
distribution, we divide bursts into two distinct luminosity classes. Most
bursts originate from low-luminosity, nearby sources while the relatively few
high-luminosity sources trace the shape of the thick disk. We find that
characteristic disk dimensions as small as 20 kpc in thickness and 30 kpc in
radial extent can match the observed brightness-dependent anisotropy as well as
the number-flux distribution; these dimensions are smaller than previously
considered viable. For bursts distributed in a disk of these compact
dimensions, the low-luminosity sources must have peak powers of $\lapprox
5\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and rate densities of $\gapprox 5\times 10^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-3}$. The high-luminosity sources must have a peak luminosity
of $\simeq 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ but their rate density need be only 5% or less
than that of the low-luminosity sources. If the Andromeda Galaxy contained a
similar population of high-luminosity sources, their peak gamma-ray fluxes
would be less than $\sim 0.1$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, making their detection
problematic. Statistical analyses of the gamma-ray burst events obtained since
the compilation of the 3B catalog will determine whether the thick-disk
interpretation is preferred over the isotropic one.

technique applied to the angular correlation function measured from the APM

the location of the break implies $\Omega h= 0.45 \pm 0.10$, where $\Omega$ is

smaller, though still quasi-linear scales, there is a feature in the APM power
spectrum where the local slope changes appreciably, with the best match to CDM
models obtained for $\Omega h \simeq 0.2$. Hence the location and narrowness of
the break in the APM power spectrum combined with the rapid change in its slope
on quasi-linear scales cannot be matched by any variant of CDM, including
models that have a non-zero cosmological constant or a tilt to the slope of the

a QSO spectrum. The results include a quantitative assessment of the
theoretical uncertainties and firm lower limits on the metallicities when no

available column densities for QSO intrinsic absorbers support previous
studies; there is strong evidence for super-solar metallicities in broad
absorption line (BAL) and at least some ``associated'' (z_a~z_e) absorption
regions. Even in cases where the level of ionization is unknown (for example,
when only H I and C IV lines are measured), firm lower limits on the metal
abundances (C/H) imply Z ~> Z_o for typical BALs and some z_a~z_e absorbers.
These results support the independent evidence for high metallicities in QSO
broad emission-line regions. I argue that high gas-phase abundances, up to ~10
Z_o, can be expected in QSOs due to the normal enrichment by stars in the cores
of young, massive (~> 10^11 M_o) galaxies. The measured column densities
indicate that the gas is usually optically thin in the continuum out to
energies above at least the CIV and NV ionization edges (i.e. >100 eV). The
column density ratios often require a range of ionization states in the same
absorber, and neighboring (blended or adjacent) systems can have ionization
parameters that differ by more than an order of magnitude. These result, and
the overall levels of ionization, are not consistent with single-zone models of
the UV line and X-ray continuum (``warm'') absorbers.

boson $m_{\pi}$ is introduced. The NG-boson zero mode integrated over the LF
must exhibit singular behavior $ \sim 1/m_{\pi}^2$ in the symmetric limit
$m_{\pi}\to 0$, which implies that current conservation is violated at zero
mode, or equivalently the LF charge is not conserved even in the symmetric
limit. We demonstrate this peculiarity in a concrete model, the linear sigma
model, where the role of zero-mode constraint is clarified. We further compare
our result with the continuum theory. It is shown that in the continuum theory
it is difficult to remove the zero mode which is not a single mode with measure
zero but the accumulating point causing uncontrollable infrared singularity. A
possible way out within the continuum theory is also suggested based on the
``$\nu$ theory''. We finally discuss another problem of the zero mode in the

Motivated by the general ideas of standard field theory we prove the
q-functional analogues of Hori's formulation of Wick's theorems for the
different ordered q-particle creation and annihilation operators. The formulae
have the same formal expressions as fermionic and bosonic ones but differ by a
nature of fields. This allows us to derive the perturbation series for the

nondegenerate, a notion that can be viewed as a generalization of Levi
nondegenerate, at $p_0\in M$. We show that if $M'$ is another such hypersurface
and $p'_0\in M'$, then the set of germs at $p_0$ of biholomorphisms $H$ with

naturally embedded as a real analytic submanifold in the complex jet group of

by equations that can be explicitly computed from defining equations of $M$ and

is assumed to provide the necessary bare cutoff functions, a gauge-invariant
theory of pion photoproduction with fully dressed nucleons is developed. The
formalism provides consistent dynamical descriptions of pi-N --> pi-N
scattering and Gamma-N --> pi-N production mechanisms in terms of nonlinear
integral equations for fully dressed hadrons. Defining electromagnetic currents
via the gauging of hadronic n-point Green's functions, dynamically detailed
currents for dressed nucleons are introduced. The dressed hadron currents and
the pion photoproduction current are explicitly shown to satisfy gauge
invariance in a self-consistent manner. Approximations are discussed that make
the nonlinear formalism manageable in practice and yet preserve gauge
invariance. This is achieved by recasting the gauge conditions for all
contributing interaction currents as continuity equations with ``surface''
terms for the individual particle legs coming into or going out of the hadronic
interaction region. General procedures are given that approximate any type of
(global) interaction current in a gauge-invariance preserving manner as a sum
of single-particle ``surface'' currents. It is argued that these prescriptions
carry over to other reactions, irrespective of the number or type of
contributing hadrons or hadronic systems.

the radii and of the number of neutron and protons using Strutinsky's method.
Shell effects come about, on the one hand, by the high degeneracy of levels
with large angular momentum and, on the other, by the big energy gaps between
states with a different number of radial nodes. Shell energies down to -40 MeV
are shown to occur for certain magic nuclei. Estimates demonstrate that the
calculated shell effects for certain magic numbers of constituents are probably
large enough to produce stability against fission, alpha-, and beta-decay. No
bubble solutions are found for mass number A < 450.

coefficients are nonnegative. We also prove that the quartic invariants of a

codes in the hopes that techniques that prove effective there will generalize.
With this in mind, we present a number of results on codes of minimum distance
2. We first compute the linear programming bound on the dimension of such a
code, then show that this bound can only be attained when the code either is of
even length, or is of length 3 or 5. We next consider questions of uniqueness,
showing that the optimal code of length 2 or 4 is unique (implying that the
well-known one-qubit-in-five single-error correcting code is unique), and
presenting nonadditive optimal codes of all greater even lengths. Finally, we
compute the full automorphism group of the more important distance 2 codes,
allowing us to determine the full automorphism group of any GF(4)-linear code.
