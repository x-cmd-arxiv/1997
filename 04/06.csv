  Conference Series, (San Francisco: ASP)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We have developed a two-dimensional orbit averaged Fokker-Planck model of
stellar clusters which expands on spherically symmetric one-dimensional models
to include rotation and ellipticity. Physical effects such as collisions,
finite stellar lifetimes and bar formation (i.e., a non-axisymmetric component
of the potential) can also be included. The first use of the model is to study
the evolution of dense clusters (rho(r=0)=~10^7 M_sun/pc^3) that may be
expected to have existed at the centres of newly-forming galaxies, with the
goal of verifying that angular momentum can be removed from the core of the
cluster quickly enough so that rotation no longer prevents the formation of a
massive (~10^2 M_sun) object. This could act as the seed black hole for the
formation of an AGN.

hypothesis (RSH) needs to be modified for transverse velocity increments, and
propose an alternative. In this new form, transverse velocity increments bear
the same relation to locally averaged enstrophy (squared vorticity) as
longitudinal velocity increments bear in RSH to locally averaged dissipation.
We support this hypothesis by analyzing high-resolution numerical simulation
data for isotropic turbulence. RSH and its proposed modification for transverse
velocity increments (RSHT) appear to represent two independent scaling groups.

perfect fluid models with barotropic equations of state. All of them contain a
component of the F field appearing as an additional scalar in 4 dimensions. A
two-parameter family of spatially flat models and four one-parameter families,
including non-spatially flat models, have been obtained (where the parameters

representation by labelled triangulations of space in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions.
We apply this to the recent proposal for causal evolution of spin networks. The
result is labelled spatial triangulations evolving with transition amplitudes
given by labelled spacetime simplices. The formalism is very similar to
simplicial gravity, however, the triangulations represent combinatorics and not
an approximation to the spatial manifold. The distinction between future and
past nodes which can be ordered in causal sets also exists here. Spacelike and
timelike slices can be defined and the foliation is allowed to vary. We clarify
the choice of the two rules in the causal spin network evolution, and the
assumption of trivalent spin networks for 2+1 spacetime dimensions and
four-valent for 3+1. As a direct application, the problem of the exponential
growth of the causal model is remedied. The result is a clear and more rigid
graphical understanding of evolution of combinatorial spin networks, on which
further work can be based.

small velocity (SV) treatment is relevant for the inclusive semileptonic b->c
transition. The extended SV limit (ESV limit) is introduced. The leading terms
in the perturbative alpha_s expansion enhanced by powers of n are automatically
resummed by using the low-scale Euclidean mass. The large-n treatment explains
why the scales of order m_b/n are appropriate. On the other hand, the scale
cannot be too small since the factorially divergent perturbative corrections
associated with running of alpha_s show up. Both requirements are met if we use
the short-distance mass normalized at a scale around m_b/n \sim 1 GeV. A
convenient definition of such low-scale OPE-compatible masses is briefly
discussed.

duality of Kutasov and Schwimmer and the deconfinement trick of Berkooz. This
analysis leads to a simple picture for supersymmetry breaking for k=2,
complementing that of previous work. We examine the flat directions of these
models, and give straightforward criteria for lifting them, explaining the
requisite peculiar form of the superpotential. For all cases with k>2, the
duality argument fails to give supersymmetry breaking dynamics, and we identify
a class of problematic flat directions, which we term 2m-baryons. We study in
some detail the requirements for lifting these directions, and uncover some
surprising facts regarding the relationship between R-symmetry and
supersymmetry breaking in models with several gauge groups.

tens of MeV/nucleon to a couple of GeV/nucleon is discussed. As the beam energy
increases and/or the impact parameter decreases, the maximum compression
increases. It is argued that the hydrodynamic behavior of matter sets in the
vicinity of balance energy. At higher energies shock fronts are observed to
form within head-on reaction simulations, perpendicular to beam axis and
separating hot compressed matter from cold. In the semicentral reactions a weak
tangential discontinuity develops in-between these fronts. The hot compressed
matter exposed to the vacuum in directions parallel to the shock fronts begins
to expand collectively into these directions. The expansion affects particle
angular distributions and mean energy components and further shapes of spectra
and mean energies of particles emitted into any one direction. The variation of
slopes and the relative yields measured within the FOPI collaboration are in a
general agreement with the results of simulations. As to the FOPI data on
stopping, they are consistent with the preference for transverse over the
longitudinal motion in the head-on Au + Au collisions. Unfortunately, though,
the data cannot be used to decide directly on that preference due to acceptance
cuts. Tied to the spatial and temporal changes in the reactions are changes in
the entropy per nucleon.
