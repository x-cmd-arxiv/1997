produce detectable thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich decrements around
quasars or quasar pairs in regions where no assembled, virialized clusters are

argue that both thermal and kinematic decrements can be produced by the baryons

decrements produced by the hot electrons confined within the cluster potential,
the magnitude of these quasar-outflow induced effects depend primarily on the
luminosity of the QSO, and the physical scale of the outflow - which in turn
depends both on the mean local density and the density gradient in the vicinity
of the quasar. Quasar outflows produce (i) a frequency independent kinematic

known as gravitomagnetism owing to its formal analogies with magnetism due to
currents of electric charge. Therefore, according to general relativity,
Earth's rotation should influence the motion of its orbiting satellites.
Indeed, we analysed the laser ranging observations of the orbits of the
satellites LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, using a program developed at NASA/GSFC, and
obtained the first direct measurement of the gravitomagnetic orbital
perturbation due to the Earth's rotation, known as the Lense-Thirring effect.

because it is not zero for states with zero (fermion) kinetic energy as
opposite to the other that is interpreted as `dressing' the mass. The former
contribution originates from (at least) triple intersections of the loop states

that gravitational field energy also acts as gravitational charge density. In
the well-known Schwarzschild solution describing field of an isolated massive
body at rest, the scalar function $\phi$ characterising the field acts as a
gravitational potential as well as it curves space part of spacetime. We
demonstrate explicitly that it is the latter property that accounts for the
non-linear (gravity as its own source) aspect which is not explicit in usual
derivations. It is worth noting that the Einstein vacuum equations ultimately
reduce to the Laplace equation and its first integral which fixes zero of
$\phi$ at infinity. Thus the Schwarzschild field alongwith its asymptotic flat
character is completely determined without application of any boundary
condition by the field equations themselves. That means non-zero constant value
of $\phi$ will have non-vacuous effect. It in fact produces stresses exactly of
the form required to represent a global monopole. By retaining freedom of
choosing zero of $\phi$, which will break asymptotic flatness, we can obtain
the Schwarzschild black hole with global monopole charge. It is the non-linear
aspect responsible for ``curving'' space, which has no Newtonian analogue,
survives even when $\phi$ is constant but not zero.

parameters in its flavor sector: 30 masses, 39 mixing angles, and 41 phases.
These parameters contain many new measurable sources of flavor violations
unless either the sparticle mass splittings and mixing angles are small or the
sparticle masses are large.
  In chapter 1 of this report, we discuss the origins of sparticle mass
splittings and mixing angles in a theory explaining flavor, and we review the
upper limits of sparticle masses that arise from naturalness among the
electroweak breaking parameters. By examining the flavor changing processes
$\mu \to e + \gamma$ and $K^0 - \bar{K}^0$ mixing, we show it is not possible
to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of flavor differentiation among
sparticles and naturalness in electroweak breaking. This indicates that a
crucial ingredient is missing from our understanding of the theory. We discuss
one possible solution in which the messengers that transmit supersymmetry
breaking to ordinary particles are much lighter than $M_{Planck}$.
  In our analysis, we found the most important constraint was the process $\mu
\to e + \gamma$. Furthermore, this process is currently being experimentally
investigated. In spite of its importance, the complete branching ratio
calculation has not yet been done. In chapter 2 we present the full one-loop

We
give special attention to the case of 8 dimensions for which we first consider
theories depending only on Yang-Mills fields. Two classes of gauge functions
exist which correspond to the choices of two different holonomy groups in
SO(8), namely SU(4) and Spin(7). The choice of SU(4) gives a quantum field
theory for a Calabi-Yau fourfold. The expectation values for the observables
are formally holomorphic Donaldson invariants. The choice of Spin(7) defines
another eight dimensional theory for a Joyce manifold which could be of
relevance in M- and F-theories. Relations to the eight dimensional
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are presented. Then, by dimensional reduction,
we obtain other theories, in particular a four dimensional one whose gauge
conditions are identical to the non-abelian Seiberg-Witten equations. The
latter are thus related to pure Yang-Mills self-duality equations in 8
dimensions as well as to the N=1, D=10 super Yang-Mills theory. We also exhibit
a theory that couples 3-form gauge fields to the second Chern class in eight
dimensions, and interesting theories in other dimensions.

we derive an open quantum-mechanical description of this D-brane foam which
embodies momentum and energy conservation and small mean energy fluctuations.
Quantum decoherence effects appear at a rate consistent with previous

different temperatures. These apparent temperatures depend only weakly on
bombarding energy. The pion angular distributions show a forward/backward
enhancement at all energies, but not the $\Theta = 90^0$ enhancement which was

rapidity distributions which are therefore in disagreement with the hypothesis
of one thermal source. The importance of the Coulomb interaction and of the

of testing recent claims that the solar neutrino puzzle requires new particle
physics. The assumption of a steady-state sun producing the correct luminosity
and governed by standard microphysics appears to leave only one nonstandard
solar model possibility open, slow mixing of the solar core on timescales
characteristic of 3He equilibration. The conjecture of such mixing raises
striking physics issues connected with the standard model 3He instability and
the possibility that the 3He abundance gradient might allow the sun's early
convective core to persist. While helioseismology might eventually rule out
such a ""model,"" contrary to one recent claim I will argue that the
helioseismology of a mixed two-fluid sun is as yet far from clear. Finally, I
conclude by stressing that 3He-driven slow mixing is not being proposed as a
solution of the solar neutrino problem, but as an example of a possibility that
has not been quantitatively modeled and yet could produce neutrino fluxes far
closer to experiment than the standard solar model. Thus, despite the
attractiveness of neutrino oscillation solutions, astrophysical explanations of
the solar neutrino problem are not yet, in my view, ruled out definitively.
