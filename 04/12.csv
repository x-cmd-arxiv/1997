\lya systems (DLAs), mostly at redshift $z_{abs} \simgt 2.5$ . By combining
these results with those from our earlier survey (Pettini et al. 1994) and
other recent data, we construct a sample of 34 measurements (or upper limits)
of the Zn abundance relative to hydrogen [Zn/H]; the sample includes more than
one third of the total number of DLAs known.
  The plot of the abundance of Zn as a function of redshift reinforces the two
main findings of our previous study. (1) Damped \lya systems are mostly
metal-poor, at all redshifts sampled; the column density weighted mean for the
whole data set is [Zn/H] $= -1.13 \pm 0.38$ (on a logarithmic scale), or
approximately 1/13 of solar. (2) There is a large spread, by up to two orders
of magnitude, in the metallicities we measure at essentially the same
redshifts. We propose that damped \lya systems are drawn from a varied
population of galaxies of different morphological types and at different stages
of chemical evolution, supporting the idea of a protracted epoch of galaxy
formation.
  At redshifts $z \simgt 2$ the typical metallicity of the damped \lya systems
is in agreement with expectations based on the consumption of HI gas implied by
the recent measurements of $\Omega_{DLA}$ by Storrie-Lombardi et al. (1996a),
and with the metal ejection rates in the universe at these epochs deduced by
Madau (1996) from the ultraviolet luminosities of high redshift galaxies
revealed by deep imaging surveys. There are indications in our data for an
increase in the mean metallicity of the damped \lya systems from $z > 3$ to
$\approx 2$, consistent with the rise in the comoving star formation rate
indicated by the relative numbers of $U$ and $B$ drop-outs in the Hubble Deep
Field. Although such comparisons are still tentative, it appears that these
different avenues for exploring the early evolution of galaxies give a broadly
consistent picture.

particles following regular orbits in a simply-barred potential are trapped

oscillate about stable loops. We find both loops which remain aligned with the

the minor axis of this larger scale gas is roughly aligned with the axis of the

within a 1' radius core is resolved into several components; the central
dominant galaxy does not coincide with either of them or the emission centroid.
The major X-ray peak is an elongated feature which coincides with optical arcs
at r=20'' from the cD. We speculate that this may be lensed X-ray emission, for
example, of the same object lensed in the optical. Alternatively, this feature
may be a merger shock, or a gas trail of an infalling subgroup. Two other X-ray
enhancements are close to the two major mass concentrations known from the
lensing analysis. Both lensing and a merger are likely.
  Previous X-ray derivations of the A2218 mass used the data with angular
resolution that blurred the features mentioned above into a broad constant
core. As the HRI data show, such a core does not exist. Because of this, the
hydrostatic estimate of the projected mass within the lensing radius can in
principle be increased by a factor of 1.4 (and the mass within a sphere by a
factor of 2.6) compared to previous analyses. However, for a merging cluster,
the hydrostatic analysis is generally inapplicable. Most other lensing clusters
are more distant than A2218 and obtaining adequate X-ray data for them is even
more difficult. Together with the likely overestimation of mass by the lensing
analysis (as in the simulations), oversimplification of the gas model resulting
from inadequate resolution may account for the lensing/X-ray mass discrepancy
as suggested for A2218. (ABRIDGED)

Energy Distributions (SEDs) of BL Lacs found in complete Radio or X-ray
surveys. A large body of observations in different bands suggests that the SEDs
of BL Lac objects appearing in X-ray surveys differ from those appearing in
radio surveys mainly in having a (synchrotron) spectral cut-off (or break) at
much higher frequency. In order to explain the different properties of radio
and X-ray selected BL Lacs Giommi and Padovani proposed a model based on a
common radio luminosity function. At each radio luminosity, objects with high
frequency spectral cut-offs are assumed to be a minority. Nevertheless they
dominate the X-ray selected population due to the larger X-ray-to-radio-flux
ratio. An alternative model explored here (reminiscent of the orientation
models previously proposed) is that the X-ray luminosity function is ""primary""
and that at each X-ray luminosity a minority of objects has larger
radio-to-X-ray flux ratio. The predictions of the two scenarios, computed via a
Montecarlo technique, are compared with the observed properties of BL Lacs in
the two samples extracted respectively from the 1 Jy radio survey and the
Einstein Slew Survey. We show that both models can explain a number but not all
the observed features. We then propose a completely new approach, based on the
idea that the physical parameter which governs the shape of the SEDs, is (or is
associated with) the bolometric luminosity. Assuming an empirical relation
between spectral shape and luminosity we show that the observational properties
of the two surveys can be reproduced at least with the same accuracy as the two
previous models.

mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) models where the standard model gauge
group is embedded into the gauge group $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_{I_{3R}}\times
U(1)_{B-L}$ (or $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$) at the supersymmetry
breaking scale $\Lambda$. Supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the visible
sector via the same fields that are responsible for gauge symmetry breaking
rather than by vector-like quarks and leptons as in the conventional GMSB
models. These models have a number of attractive properties such as exact
R-parity conservation, non-vanishing neutrino masses and a solution to the
SUSYCP (and strong CP) problem. In this paper, we present the detailed
sparticle spectroscopy and phenomenological implications of the various models
of this class that embody the general spirit of our previous work but use a
larger variety of messenger fields. A distinct characteristic of this class of
models is that unlike the conventional GMSB ones, the lightest neutralino is
always the NLSP leading to photonic events in the colliders.

section for $\pi^0\pi^0$ production is very small and has a maximum when the
pions propagate together. However, the kinematical region where the energies
and polar angles of the two $\pi^0$ mesons are equal and their relative
azimuthal angle $\phi=180^0$ is forbidden. Conversely in the $\pi^-\pi^+$
production the pions prefer to have a relative azimuthal angle 180$^0$ and the
production of the pions propagating together is suppressed. The dominant
one-body mechanism in both channels is related to the excitation of the
$\Delta$ isobar. Hence the reaction can serve as a source of information about
$\Delta$'s properties in nucleus. We have found that the reaction is sensitive
to effects of the pion and $\Delta$ renormalization in the nuclear medium,
similar to those found in the coherent $(\gamma,\pi^0)$ reaction, but magnified
because of the presence of the two pions.
