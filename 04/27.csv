led to the discovery of a fading X-ray and optical counterparts of the burst.
About a month after the GRB event the proper motion of the ejecta was detected
and the extended optical source has faded below the Keck detection level. We
analyze these observations in the framework of the most popular gamma ray burst
models. We find a lower limit on the distance to GRB 970228 d>6.6 pc. We
estimate the amount of energy required to explain the motion of a point source
and the variability of the extended source. We find that the cosmological
models are ruled out. The Galactic corona models suffer difficulties if the
distance to the burst is > 100 kpc or the variability of the extended source is
directly connected with the burst No constraints are found for GRBs originating
between 6.6 pc and $\sim 10$ kpc.

non-Gaussianity in the Cosmic Microwave Background. The importance of
rotational invariance and statistical independence is stressed, but we show
that these are sometimes incompatible. It is shown that the first of these
requirements prefers a real space (or wavelet) formulation, whereas the latter
favours quantities defined in Fourier space. Bearing this in mind we decide to
be eclectic and define two new sets of statistics to quantify the level of
non-Gaussianity. Both sets make use of the concept of cumulants of a
distribution. However, one set is defined in real space, with reference to the
wavelet transform, whereas the other is defined in Fourier space. We derive a
series of properties concerning these statistics for a Gaussian random field
and show how one can relate these quantities to the higher order moments of
temperature maps. Although our frameworks lead to an infinite hierarchy of
quantities we show how cosmic variance and experimental constraints give a
natural truncation of this hierarchy. We then focus on the real space
statistics and analyse the non-Gaussian signal generated by points sources
obscured by large scale Gaussian fluctuations. We conclude by discussing the
practical implementations of these techniques.

bcc binary alloys, using a semi-infinite lattice model equivalent to a
nearest-neighbor Ising antiferromagnet in an external field. The salient
feature of the model is the generation of an ``effective'' ordering surface
field for symmetry-breaking surface orientations like (100). Such a field
couples to the local order parameter at the surface and leads to the occurrence
of wetting phenomena below the critical temperature T_c. Utilizing a
Ginzburg-Landau continuum model which has been derived earlier from the lattice
mean-field theory, the wetting phase diagram is calculated.

scalar field appears as just avoiding the appearance of closed trapped surfaces
while coming from the exterior region. It also follows that the usual space
integral over the temporal- temporal components of energy-momnetum tensor in
the internal region just gives the total proper mass associated to the external

effectively studies a 1+1-dimensional gauge theory coupled to matter in the
adjoint representation. We study the structure of coupling constant space for
our effective potential by comparing with the physical results available from
conventional Euclidean lattice Monte Carlo simulations of this system. In
particular, we calculate and measure the scaling behaviour of the entire
low-lying glueball spectrum, glueball wavefunctions, string tension, asymptotic
density of states, and deconfining temperature. We employ a new hybrid
DLCQ/wavefunction basis in our calculations of the light-cone Hamiltonian
matrix elements, along with extrapolation in Tamm-Dancoff truncation,
significantly reducing numerical errors. Finally we discuss, in light of our
