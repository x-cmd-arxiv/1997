associations at several different stages in their life histories. We have
obtained ROSAT PSPC and HRI X-ray observations, Curtis Schmidt CCD images,
echelle spectra in H-alpha and [N II] lines, and IUE interstellar absorption
line observations of this region. The central bubble of N11 has an X-ray
luminosity a factor of only 3-7 brighter than predicted for an
energy-conserving superbubble, making this the first detection of X-ray
emission from a superbubble without a strong X-ray excess. The region N11B
contains an extremely young OB association analogous to the central association
of the Carina nebula, apparently still embedded in its natal molecular cloud.
We find that N11B emits diffuse X-ray emission, probably powered by stellar
winds. Finally, we compare the tight cluster HD32228 in N11 to R136 in 30 Dor.
The latter is a strong X-ray source, while the former is not detected, showing
that strong X-ray emission from compact objects is not a universal property of
such tight clusters.

Inspection of the models and observations reveals that gas entering the bar

dust lane enters the nuclear ring; the remaining gas sprays around the ring to

relatively insensitive to the shape or size of the bar. Our observations of the

examined in a space spanned by four purely morphological parameters. Galaxy
images are taken from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary
Camera 2 (WFPC2) in the I band (F814W). Since we have little prior knowledge on
how galaxies are distributed in morphology space we use an unsupervised
learning method (a variant of Kohonen's Self Organizing Maps, or SOMs). This
method allows the data to organize themselves onto a two-dimensional space
while conserving most of the topology of the original space. It thus enables us
to visualize the distribution of galaxies and study it more easily. The process
is fully automated, does not rely on any kind of eyeball classification and is
readily applicable to large numbers of images. We apply it to a sample of 2934
galaxies, and find that morphology correlates well with the apparent magnitude
distribution and to lesser extents with color and bulge dominance. The
resulting map traces a morphological sequence similar to the Hubble Sequence,
albeit two dimensional. We use the SOM as a diagnostic tool, and rediscover a
population of bulge-dominated galaxies with morphologies characteristic of
peculiar galaxies. This is achieved without recourse to eyeball classification.
We also examine the effect of noise on the resulting SOM, and conclude that
down to I magnitude of 24 our results are reliable. We propose using this
method as a framework into which more physical data can be incorporated when
they become available. Hopefully, this will lead to a deeper understanding of
galaxy evolution.

first red giant branch (TRGB) in the color magnitude (CM) diagrams of nearby
dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies, commonly interpreted as indication of the
existence of an intermediate-age population, may, in certain circumstances, be
an artifact of observational effects on a pure old population system. For this
purpose, model CM diagrams have been computed simulating the observational
effects that can be found in different regions of a Local Group dE galaxy. The
starting synthetic CM diagram represents a pure old system, with star formation
extending only from 15 to 12 Gyr ago. Based on those model diagrams, we analyze
the conclusions that a hypothetical ground-based observer might reach
concerning the presence of a population of stars above the tip of the red giant
branch (TRGB) that could be interpreted as an intermediate-age population, by
using two age indicators extensively employed in the literature: i) the
bolometric magnitude at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, and
ii) the ratio of AGB to red giant branch (RGB) stars present in the CM diagram.
Our analysis shows that, if observational effects are overlooked, application
of both methods would result in finding a fictitious intermediate-age
population in the inner regions of the galaxy, where crowding is more severe.

the mass-selected catalogue can be compared with observations for
richness-selected cluster catalogues. We build a model cluster catalogue for
the Omega_0=1 CDM scenario that is designed to mimic the ENACS sample of rich
Abell clusters. We use the distribution of richness, corrected for
incompleteness, to fix the present epoch. We find sigma_8=0.4-0.5, which is

volume is filled by the voids. The voids have a scale of at least 40 h^{-1}Mpc,

they do populate them more than bright ones. These results suggest that both

technique. In strong fields orbit bifurcations, boundary effects (grazing
orbits) and diffractive effects (creeping orbits) come into play, and the
comparison with the exact quantum mechanical result shows major deviations. We
show that the dominant corrections stem from grazing orbits, the other effects

Maslov index by a quantum-mechanical reflection phase, and obtain a good
agreement between the semiclassical and the quantum result for all field
strengths. With this description, we are able to explain the main features of

behavior in the impurity magnetic susceptibility, the impurity specific heat
and in the quasiparticle phase shift which can be used to diagnose the nature
of the condensed state. We construct an effective theory for this problem and
show that it is equivalent to a multichannel (one per node) non-marginal Kondo
problem with linear density of states and coupling constant J. There is a
quantum phase transition from an unscreened impurity state to an overscreened
Kondo state at a critical value J_c which varies with $\Delta_0$, the
superconducting gap away from the nodes. In the overscreened phase, the
impurity Fermi level $\epsilon_f$ and the amplitude $\Delta$ of the ground
state singlet vanish at J_c like $\Delta_0 \exp(- const. / \Delta)$ and J-J_c
respectively. We derive the scaling laws for the susceptibility and specific
heat in the overscreened phase at low fields and temperatures.

systematic results for the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic

heat and moment of inertia. Our analysis points out important differences with
respect to the thermodynamic behaviour of uniform Bose gases. This is mainly
the consequence of a major role played by single particle states at the

condensate is strongly enhanced by the presence of repulsive interactions and
that the critical temperature is decreased with respect to the predictions of
the non-interacting model. Our work points out an important scaling behaviour
exhinited by the system in large $N$ limit. Scaling permits to express all the
relevant thermodynamic quantities in terms of only two parameters: the reduced

fluctuations of the order parameter(s) in the vacuum state and the
contributions of ``quasiparticles'' corresponding to other local minima of the
effective potential is needed. At large distances, the ordinary quasiparticle
picture emerges in the response of the system to classical background fields
but the above mentioned component acts as a source for them.

many properties of black holes in the same class can be infered from the study

large magnetic field F on the (p+2) brane, the problem is shown to admit a
perturbative analysis in an expansion in inverse powers of F. It is found that,
to the leading order in 1/F, the quartic potential of the tachyonic state from
the open string stretched between the p- and (p+2)-brane gives a vacuum energy
which agrees with the prediction of the BPS mass formula for the bound state.
We generalize the discussion to the case of m p-branes plus 1 (p+2)-brane with
magnetic field. The T dual picture of this, namely several (p+2)-branes
carrying some p-brane charges through magnetic flux is also discussed, where
the perturbative treatment is available in the small F limit. We show that once
again, in the same approximation, the tachyon condensates give rise to the
correct BPS mass formula. The role of 't Hooft's toron configurations in the
extension of the above results beyond the quartic approximation as well as the
issue of the unbroken gauge symmetries are discussed. We comment on the
connection between the present bound state problem and Kondo-like problems in
the context of relevant boundary perturbations of boundary conformal field

the lowest possible dimension, have propagators of dimension $m^{-2}$, and obey
gauge invariance. It is shown that the number of momenta required for
amplitudes involving particles with s > 2 is higher than the number implied by
3-vertices for higher spin particles derived in the literature. Therefore, the
dimension of the coupling constants following from the latter 3-vertices has a
smaller power of an inverse mass than our results imply. Consequently, the

Elliptic boundary-value problems, index problems for closed manifolds and for

makes it clear why the Dirac operator is the most fundamental, in the theory of
elliptic operators on manifolds. The topic of spectral geometry is developed by
studying non-local boundary conditions of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type, and
heat-kernel asymptotics for operators of Laplace type on manifolds with
boundary. The emphasis is put on the functorial method, which studies the
behaviour of differential operators, boundary operators and heat-kernel
coefficients under conformal rescalings of the background metric. In the second
part, a number of relevant physical applications are studied: non-local
boundary conditions for massless spin-1/2 fields, massless spin-3/2 potentials
on manifolds with boundary, geometric theory of massive spin-3/2 potentials,
local boundary conditions in quantum supergravity, quark boundary conditions,
one-loop quantum cosmology, conformally covariant operators and Euclidean

Breit-Wigner form through the phi meson resonance. The dominant contribution to
phi meson production in heavy ion collisions at these energies is found to come
from secondary pion-nucleon collisions. Effects due to medium modifications of
kaon masses are also studied and are found to reduce the phi meson yield by
about a factor of two, mainly because of increased phi decay width as a result
of dropping kaon-antikaon masses. In this case, the $\phi/K^-$ ratio is about
4%, which is a factor of 2-3 below preliminary experimental data from the FOPI
collaboration at GSI. Including also the reduction of phi meson mass in medium
increases this ratio to about 8%, which is then in reasonable agreement with
