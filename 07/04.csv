with WFPC2 on the Hubble Space Telescope through visual, blue and mid- and
far-UV filters in a programme devoted to study the UV population in a sample of
Galactic globular clusters. In the UV Color Magnitude Diagrams derived from the
HST images we have discovered three faint objects with a strong UV excess,
which lie significantly outside the main loci defined by more than 12,000
normal cluster stars. The positions of two of the UV stars are nearly
coincident (7"" & 1"") to those of a low luminosity X-ray source recently found
in the core of M13 and to a 3.5-sigma peak in the X-ray contour map. We suggest
that the UV stars are physically connected to the X-ray emission. The UV stars
are very similar to the quiescent nova in the globular cluster M80, and they
might be a, perhaps new, subclass of cataclysmic variable.

sequences and thus the same age to well within 1 Gyr. Since other
low-metallicity clusters throughout the Milky Way halo have this same age to
within the 1-Gyr precision of the differential age technique, we conclude that
the earliest star (or globular cluster) formation began at essentially the same
time everywhere in the Galactic halo throughout a region now almost 200 kpc in
diameter. Thus for the metal-poorest clusters in the halo there is no
detectable age gradient with Galactocentric distance. To estimate the absolute
age of NGC 2419 and M92, we fit newly computed isochrones transformed through
model-atmosphere calculations to the (M_V,V-I) plane, with assumed distance
scales that represent the range currently debated in the literature.
Unconstrained isochrone fits give M_V(RR) = 0.55 \pm 0.06 and a resulting age
of 14 to 15 Gyr. Incorporating the full effects of helium diffusion would
further reduce this estimate by about 1 Gyr. A distance scale as bright as

several serious problems which have no obvious solution in the context of

the binary merger scenario of GRBs naturally results in the comoving

Galactic bulge that employs a small camera rather than a conventional telescope
and probes new regions of parameter space. The small aperture (~65 mm) permits
detection of stellar flux variations corresponding to magnitudes 7<I<16,
whereas current searches are restricted by saturation to I>15. The large pixel
size (~10"") and ~(6 deg)^2 field of view allows observation of the entire bulge
with a few pointings. With this large pixel size (and with the even larger 30""
PSF that we advocate) most bulge stars are unresolved, so one is in the regime
of pixel lensing: microlensing and other forms of stellar variation are
detected from the difference of pixel counts in successive images. We identify
three principal uses of such a search. First, the observations are analogous to
normal pixel lensing observations of the bulge of M31, but are carried out
under conditions where the detected events can be followed up in detail. This
permits crucial checks on the systematics of the M31 searches. Second, the
search gives a complete inventory of bright bulge variables. Third, ""extreme
microlensing events"" (EMEs) can be found in real time. EMEs are events with
maximum magnifications A_max~200 which, if they were observed intensively from
two observatories, could yield the mass, distance, and speed of the
gravitational lens. The instrumentation required to carry out the observations
is inexpensive. The observations could be made in parallel with existing
microlensing searches and/or follow-up observations. The data reduction is much
simpler than in ordinary pixel lensing because the PSF can be fixed by the
optics and so does not vary with atmospheric conditions.

shifts into sums over paths in phase space. We show that tunneling transport is
dominated by chaos-assisted paths that tunnel into and out of the chaotic layer
via the ``beach'' regions sandwiched between the regular islands and the
chaotic sea. Level splittings are shown to fluctuate on two scales as functions
of energy or an external parameter: they display a dense sequence of peaks due
to resonances with states supported by the chaotic sea, overlaid on top of slow
modulations arising from resonances with states supported by the ``beaches''.
We obtain analytic expressions which enable us to assess the relative
importance of tunneling amplitudes into the chaotic sea vs. its internal
transport properties. Finally, we average over the statistics of the chaotic
region, and derive the asymptotic tail of the splitting distribution function

proportional to the mean free collision time $\tau_{relax} \sim T^{-1/2}$.
Approaching the critical temperature ($T_c < T < 2.7~ T_c$), quantum statistic

Nevertheless, this does not affect the relaxation properties of the gas that
depend only on the spontaneous collision term in BNE. The relaxation time

We work within the framework of the linear sigma model using classical

pion fields. For large-radius tubes, starting from quark densities that are
very close to critical, we find that a disoriented chiral condensate can form
in the centre of the tube. Eventually the collapse of the tube drives this
state back to the true vacuum. This process converts the disoriented
condensate, dominated by long-wavelength pion modes, into a coherent excitation
of the pion field that includes significant components with transverse momenta
of around 400 MeV. In contrast, for narrow tubes or larger initial
temperatures, amplification occurs only via the pion-laser-like mechanism found
previously for spherical systems. In addition, we find that explicit chiral

to determine the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ entering the real-photon forward
Compton scattering amplitude. The method is based on an interference of the
Bethe-Heitler and the virtual Compton scattering mechanisms, generating an
azimuthal asymmetry in the $e^+$ versus $e^-$ yield. The general case of a
circularly polarized beam and a longitudinally polarized target allows one to
determine both the real and imaginary parts of $f_1$ as well as $f_2$. The
imaginary part of $f_2$ requires target polarization only. We calculate cross
sections and asymmetries of the reaction $p(\gamma,e^+e^-)p$, estimate
corrections and backgrounds, and propose suitable kinematical regions to
perform the experiment. Our investigation shows that photoproduction of
$e^+e^-$-pairs off the proton and light nuclei may serve as a rather sensitive
test of the validity of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule.

energetic enough to produce hadronic final states via coherent couplings.
Virtual photons from the nuclear EM fields can interact in two-photon
interactions, which can be exploited to study many particle spectroscopy and
QCD topics. Because the photon flux scales as $Z^2$, Two-photon luminosities
are large up to an energy of about \gamma\hbar c/R~ 3 GeV/c. Photon-Pomeron
interactions are sensitive to how different vector mesons, including the
$J/\psi$, interact with nuclear matter. $PP$ collisions rates are sensitive to
the range of the Pomeron. Signals can be separated from backgrounds by using
cuts on final state isolation (rapidity gaps) and $p_\perp$. We present Monte
Carlo studies of different backgrounds, showing that representative signals can
be extracted with good rates and signal to noise ratios.

through effective Lagrangians. Contributions from several nucleon resonances as
well as nucleon Born terms and vector meson exchange diagrams are included.
Nucleon and eta wavefunctions are solutions of Dirac and Klein-Gordon
equations, respectively. Final state interactions of the outgoing particles are
included via optical potentials. The effects of these interactions on the cross
sections and photon asymmetries are studied and are found to be large.
Calculations indicate that at energies near threshold the exclusive reaction
takes place mainly through formation of the S_{11}(1535) resonance. Comparisons
with the non-relativistic calculations show differences between the two
approaches both for the cross sections and photon asymmetries. We give some
detailed predictions for the reaction observables for exclusive photoproduction

contributions to the elementary cross section are fixed by fits to partial wave
amplitudes of pion photoproduction. The cross sections for $NR \to NN$, needed
for the calculation of collision broadening, are obtained by detailed balance
from a fit to $NN \to NN\pi$ cross sections. We show that a reasonable
