remnants (SNRs), G003.8--00.3 (formerly G003.7--00.2) and G350.0--02.0
(formerly G350.0-01.8). Although the two objects are very different in
appearance, in both cases the radio emission shows a clear bilateral (or
``barrel'') morphology for which the axis is parallel to the Galactic Plane.
  The majority of Galactic SNRs have now been observed at high resolution, and
one can define a clear bilateral subset of the population. We consider a sample
of 17 such SNRs, and find a highly significant tendency for the bilateral axes
of these SNRs to be aligned with the Galactic Plane. We interpret this as
indicating that ``extrinsic'' effects dominate the morphology of such remnants.
Specifically, we argue that the Galactic magnetic field causes these SNRs to
appear bilateral, either directly, in the form of magnetic field compression
and/or quasi-perpendicular acceleration of electrons in the supernova shock, or
more likely indirectly, by pre-processing the interstellar medium to produce
density stratifications extended along the Plane.

high-pressure phase of stoichiometric FeO is that the system should be a band
insulator in the ordered antiferromagnetic (AF) state and that the existence of
a band gap leads to special stability of the phase. The observed metallicity of
the high-pressure and high-temperature phase of FeO may be caused by the loss
of AF order and also by the itinerant carriers created by non-stoichiometry.
Analysis of x-ray diffraction experiments provides a further support to the

of the coupled motion of a sphere and a set of resonators attached to it at

immersed submanifold of dimension, p -- representing the history of a

Furthermore, the laws of temporal evolution and symmetries of such systems are
derived, in general, from the Einstein field equations and the integrability
conditions. We also present a matter model based on a 2-dimensional involutive
