  at $z>1.3$: Possible Solutions of the Enigma","9 pages, 5 Postscript figures, Submitted to ApJ Letters",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We have investigated the properties of a bright K-band selected sample of
early-type galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field, as representative of the field
galaxy population. This dataset is unique as for the morphological information
on faint high-z sources, and for complete photometric and spectroscopic
coverage. The majority of bright early-type galaxies in this field are found at
redshifts $z \leq 1.3$ to share common properties with those of high-z cluster
samples, as for the age and mass of the dominant stellar population -- which
are found to be as old as 3-5 Gyr and as massive as $10^{11} M_\odot$ already
at $z\simeq 1$. There is no evidence of a steepening of the mass function from
$z$=0 to $z$=1, as inferred by some authors from analyses of optically-selected
samples and favoured by hierarchical clustering models forming most of the
E/S0s at $z<1$. What distinguishes this sample is a remarkable absence of
objects at $z>1.3$, which would be expected as clearly detectable above the
flux limits, given the aged properties of the lower redshift counterparts. So,
something hide them at high redshifts. Merging could be an explanation, but it
would require that already formed and old stellar systems would assemble on
short timescales of 1 Gyr or less. Only a negligible fraction of the galactic
mass in young stars has to be added, a rather contrived situation from the
dynamical point of view. An alternative interpretation could be that a
dust-polluted ISM obscures the first 3 to 4 Gyr of the evolution of these
massive systems, after which a galactic wind and gas consumption makes them
transparent. The presence of dust would have relevant (and testable)
implications for the evaluation of the global energetics from galaxy formation
and for the visibility of the early phases by current and future infrared

of the Raman scattered O VI lines(lambda lambda 6827,7088) in symbiotic stars.
A point-like isotropic UV radiation source is assumed and a simple spherical
wind model is adopted for the kinematics of the scattering material from the
cool giant. We first investigate the case where the incident line photons are
described by a Gaussian profile having a width of 10^4 K. We subsequently
investigate the effects of the extended ionized region and non-spherical wind
models including a disk-type wind and a bipolar wind. The cases where the
emissin source is described by non-Gaussian profiles are briefly studied.
Finally, as an additional component for the kinematics of symbiotic stars the
orbital motion of the hot component around the cool giant is included and the
effect on the spectropolarimetry is investigated. In this case the polarization
direction changes around the red part of the Raman-scattered emission lines,
when the observer's line of sight is perpendicular to the orbital plane, and no
such effect is seen when the line of sight lies in the orbital plane.
Furthermore, complex peak structures are seen in the degree of polarization and
polarized flux, which have often been observed in several symbiotic systems
including RR Tel. Brief observational consequences and preditions are discussed
in relation to the present and future spectropolarimetry for symbiotic stars.
It is concluded that spectropolarimetry may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the physical conditions of symbiotic stars.

combining our calcium index information with the Zinn and West ranking, we are
able to rank the globular clusters in our sample with a typical precision of
+/- 0.05 dex for [Fe/H] < -0.5 on the Zinn and West scale; for clusters more

technique, a direct application of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem to
LIGO's readout observable, $x(t)=$(longitudinal position of test-mass face,
weighted by laser beam's Gaussian profile). Previous analyses, which relied on
a normal-mode decomposition of the test-mass motion, were valid only if the
dissipation is uniformally distributed over the test-mass interior, and they
converged reliably to a final answer only when the beam size was a
non-negligible fraction of the test-mass cross section. This paper's direct
analysis, by contrast, can handle inhomogeneous dissipation and arbitrary beam
sizes. In the domain of validity of the previous analysis, the two methods give
the same answer for $S_x(f)$, the spectral density of thermal noise, to within
expected accuracy. The new analysis predicts that thermal noise due to
dissipation concentrated in the test mass's front face (e.g. due to mirror
coating) scales as $1/r_0^2$, by contrast with homogeneous dissipation, which
scales as $1/r_0$ ($r_0$ is the beam radius); so surface dissipation could

twist element, as well as of its coproduct, for $su_{q}(2)$. We also discuss,
as applications, the computation of the universal R-matrix in this
representation and the problem of symmetrization of identical-particle states
with quantum $su(2)$ symmetry.

decoherence is discussed. We analyze different preparations of n two level
systems as well as different measurement procedures. We show that standard
Ramsey spectroscopy on uncorrelated atoms and optimal measurements on maximally
entangled states provide the same resolution. The best resolution is achieved
using partially entangled preparations with a high degree of symmetry.

elastica in two dimensional space using path integral method. In the
calculation, the MKdV hierarchy naturally appeared as the equations including
the temperature fluctuation.I have classified the moduli of the closed elastica
in heat bath and summed the Boltzmann weight with the thermalfluctuation over
the moduli. Due to the bilinearity of the energy functional,I have obtained its
exact partition function.By investigation of the system,I conjectured that an
expectation value at a critical point of this system obeys the Painlev\'e
equation of the first kind and its related equations extended by the KdV
hierarchy.Furthermore I also commented onthe relation between the MKdV
hierarchy and BRS transformationin this system.
