intermediate-redshift (z~0.5) clusters observed with WFPC-2 on the Hubble Space
Telescope, we derive relations between morphology and local galaxy density
similar to that found by Dressler for low-redshift clusters. Taken
collectively, the `morphology-density' relationship, M-D, for these more
distant, presumably younger clusters is qualitatively similar to that found for
the local sample, but a detailed comparison shows two substantial differences:
(1) For the clusters in our sample, the M-D relation is strong in centrally
concentrated ``regular'' clusters, those with a strong correlation of radius
and surface density, but nearly absent for clusters that are less concentrated
and irregular, in contrast to the situation for low redshift clusters where a
strong relation has been found for both. (2) In every cluster the fraction of
elliptical galaxies is as large or larger than in low-redshift clusters, but
the S0 fraction is 2-3 times smaller, with a proportional increase of the
spiral fraction. Straightforward, though probably not unique, interpretations
of these observations are (1) morphological segregation proceeds
hierarchically, affecting richer, denser groups of galaxies earlier, and (2)
the formation of elliptical galaxies predates the formation of rich clusters,
and occurs instead in the loose-group phase or even earlier, but S0's are
generated in large numbers only after cluster virialization.

  mass-loss?","35 pages, including 1 fig and 2 tables, to appear in Astrophysical
  Journal -- ps document",,"10.1086/304993","NAIC#384","astro-ph",,"  Gravitational contraction always generates a radially directed momentum flux.
A particularly simple example occurs in the electron-degenerate cores of AGB
stars, which contract steadily under the addition of helium ashes from shell
hydrogen burning. The resulting momentum flux is quantified here. And since the
cores of AGB stars lack efficient momentum cancellation mechanisms, they can
maintain equilibrium by exporting their excess momentum flux to the stellar
envelope, which disposes of much of it in a low velocity wind. Gravitational
contraction easily accounts for the momentum flux in the solar wind, as well as
the flux required to lift mass into the dust formation zone of every AGB star,
whereon radiation pressure continues its ejection as a low velocity wind. This
mechanism explains the dependence of the AGB mass-loss rate on core mass; its
generalization to objects with angular momentum and/or strong magnetic fields
suggests a novel explanation of why most planetary nebulae and proto planetary
nebulae exhibit axial symmetry.
  Quasistatic contraction is inherently biased to the generation of the maximum
possible momentum flux. Its formalism is therefore readily adapted to providing
an upper limit to the momentum flux needed to sustain mass loss when this
begins from a semi-continuous rather than impulsive process.

began in the central region of the galaxy where stars formed for several
billion years before the process of star formation became efficient enough in
the outer regions of the galaxy to allow for the formation of large numbers of

have complex global star formation histories with local variations of the rate

the initial high density field are the sites onto which matter accretes and
collapses to form the present galaxies and clusters of galaxies, whereas in the
latter these structures can form around the density perturbation seeds (which
are textures in the texture model). Textures initially are randomly distributed
on scales larger than their size, in sharp contrast to the initial high density
peaks in the Gaussian models which are already strongly clustered before any
gravitational evolution has occured. One thus expects that the resultant
correlation of large cosmic objects such as clusters of galaxies in the texture
model should be significantly weaker than its Gaussian counterpart.
  We show that an $\Omega_0=1$ biased $b=2$ (as required by cluster abundance
observations) texture model (or any random seed model) predicts a two-point
correlation length of $\le 6.0h^{-1}$Mpc for rich clusters, independent of
richness. On the other hand, the observed correlation length for rich clusters
is $\ge 10.0h^{-1}$Mpc at an approximately $2\sigma$ confidence level. It thus
appears that the global texture cosmological model or any random seed
cosmological models of this sort are ruled out at a very high confidence

passage through 100\kms shock waves relatively unscathed. High velocity (>= 250

stardust never encountered such fast shocks before incorporation into the solar
system. All grains should therefore retain traces of their passage through
interstellar shocks during their propagation through the ISM. The grain
surfaces should show evidence of processing due to sputtering and pitting due
to small grain cratering collisions on the micron-sized grains. This conclusion
seems to be in conflict with the evidence from the large grains recovered from

with multiple successors (MSO) is well suited in many respects as a realistic
formal base for syntactic theorizing. However, the agreeable formal properties
of this logic come at a cost: MSO is equivalent with the class of regular tree
automata/grammars, and, thereby, with the class of context-free languages.
  This paper outlines one approach towards a solution of MSO's expressivity
problem. On the background of an algebraically refined Chomsky hierarchy, which
allows the definition of several classes of languages--in particular, a whole
hierarchy between CF and CS--via regular tree grammars over unambiguously
derivable alphabets of varying complexity plus their respective
yield-functions, it shows that not only some non-context-free string languages
can be captured by context-free means in this way, but that this approach can
be generalized to the corresponding structures. I.e., non-recognizable sets of
structures can--up to homomorphism--be coded context-freely. Since the class of
languages covered--Fischer's (1968} OI family of indexed languages--includes
all attested instances of non-context-freeness in natural language, there
exists an indirect, to be sure, but completely general way to formally describe
the natural languages using a weak framework like MSO.

other Monte Carlo techniques is given. The loop algorithm is a Quantum Monte
Carlo procedure which employs nonlocal changes of worldline configurations,
determined by local stochastic decisions. It is based on a formulation of
quantum models of any dimension in an extended ensemble of worldlines and
graphs, and is related to Swendsen-Wang algorithms. It can be represented
directly on an operator level, both with a continuous imaginary time path
integral and with the stochastic series expansion (SSE). It overcomes many of
the difficulties of traditional worldline simulations. Autocorrelations are
reduced by orders of magnitude. Grand-canonical ensembles, off-diagonal
operators, and variance reduced estimators are accessible. In some cases,
infinite systems can be simulated. For a restricted class of models, the
fermion sign problem can be overcome. Transverse magnetic fields are handled
efficiently, in contrast to strong diagonal ones. The method has been applied

Fermi-surface details are thus important for the symmetry of the

author as a plausible geometrical origin to string theory and extended objects.
Scale Relativity is to scales what motion Relativity is to velocities. The
universal, absolute, impassible, invariant scale under dilatations in Nature is
taken to be the Planck scale, which is not the same as the string scale.
Starting with ordinary actions for strings and other extended objects, we show
that gauge theories of volume-resolutions scale-relativistic symmetries, of the
world volume measure associated with the extended ``fuzzy'' objects, are a
natural and viable way to formulate the geometrical principle underlying the
theory of all extended objects. Gauge invariance can only be implemented if the
extendon actions in $D$ target dimensions are embedded in $D+1$ dimensions with
an extra temporal variable corresponding to the scaling dimension of the
original string coordinates. This is achieved upon viewing the extendon
coordinates, from the fuzzy worldvolume point of view, as noncommuting matrices
valued in the Lie algebra of Lorentz-scale relativistic transformations.
Preliminary steps are taken to merge motion relativity with scale relativity by
introducing the gauge field that gauges the Lorentz-scale symmetries in the
same vain that the spin connection gauges ordinary Lorentz transformations and,
in this fashion, one may go beyond string theory to construct the sought-after
General Theory of Scale-Motion Relativity. Such theory requires the
introduction of the scale-graviton (in addition to the ordinary graviton) which
is the field that gauges the symmetry which converts motion dynamics into
scaling-resolutions dynamics and vice versa (the analog of the gravitino that
gauges supersymmetry). To go beyond the quantum string geometry most probably

A 57, 3229 (1998)","10.1103/PhysRevA.57.3229",,"quant-ph",,"  Energy and time entangled photons at a wavelength of 1310 nm are produced by
parametric downconversion in a KNbO3 crystal and are sent into all-fiber
interferometers using a telecom fiber network. The two interferometers of this
Franson-type test of the Bell-inequality are located 10.9 km apart from one
another. Two-photon fringe visibilities of up to 81.6 % are obtained. These
strong nonlocal correlations support the nonlocal predictions of quantum
mechanics and provide evidence that entanglement between photons can be
maintained over long distances.
