morphological types. Basic light curve parameters, e.g., the outburst peak
flux, amplitude, luminosity, rise and decay timescales, the observed and
expected outburst durations, and total energy radiated, are tabulated and
discussed. The rise timescales are found to have a flat distribution while the
decay timescales have a much narrower and near-Gaussian distribution, centered
around 30 days and dominated by the strongest outbursts. The peak luminosity is
also distributed like a Gaussian, centered around 0.2 in Eddington units, while
the total energy released has a much broader distribution around 10E44 ergs.
  We identify and discuss additional light curve features, such as precursors,
plateaus, and secondary maxima. The plateaus exhibited in the light curves of
black hole sources are found to have, on average, longer durations and they are
followed by longer decays. The identified secondary maxima seem to occur mostly
in black hole systems. For the frequency of outbursts, we find that the average
XN outburst rate is about 2.6 per year for events >0.3 Crab, and that the mean
recurrence time between outbursts from a single source is 6 years. The spatial
and logN-logS distribution of the XN sources, with limited statistics, agrees
with a source population in the Galactic disk, as observed from a point at a
distance of 8.5 kpc from the Galactic center. Finally, we point out that the

other pyrochlore compounds, though sharing the same structure with

simulations indicates that the Eu ions are not randomly distributed over all
the cation sites. The deviation from a random distribution is much smaller if J
is assumed to be the nearest-neighbor exchange constant J_{1} rather than the
next-nearest-neighbor exchange constant J_{2}. On this basis, J is tentatively
identified as J_{1}. To obtain agreement with the data, it must be assumed that
the Eu ions tend to bunch together. Comparision with microprobe data indicates
that the length scale for these concentration variations is smaller than a few
micrometer. The theoretical simulations in the present work improve on those
performed earlier by including clusters larger than three spins.

supersymmetry breaking is fed down to the observable sector has rich
implications on the way Nature may have chosen to accomplish inflation. We
discuss a simple model for slow rollover inflation which is minimal in the
sense that the inflaton may be identified with the field responsible for the
generation of the $\mu$-term. Inflation takes place at very late times and is
characterized by a very low reheating temperature. This property is crucial to
solve the gravitino problem and may help to ameliorate the cosmological moduli
problem. The COBE normalized value of the vacuum energy driving inflation is
naturally of the order of $10^{11}$ GeV. This favors the N=1 supergravity
scenario where supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gravitational
interactions. Nonetheless, smaller values of the vacuum energy are not excluded
by present data on the temperature anisotropy and the inflationary scenario may
be implemented in the context of new recent ideas about gauge mediation where
the standard model gauge interactions can serve as the messangers of
supersymmetry breaking. In this class of models supersymmetry breaking masses
are usually prop ortional to the F-term of a gauge singlet superfield. The same
F-term may provide the vacuum energy density necessary to drive inflation. The
spectrum of density perturbations is characterized by a spectral index which is
significantly displaced from one. The measurements of the temperature
anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation at the accuracy
expected to result from the planned missions will be able to confirm or
disprove this prediction and to help in getting some deeper insight into the
nature of supersymmetry breaking.

are discussed from the nuclear-physics perspective. Interpretation of precise
isotope-shift measurements is formalism dependent, and care must be exercised
in interpreting these results and those obtained from relativistic electron
scattering from nuclei. We strongly advocate that the entire nuclear-charge
operator be used in calculating nuclear-size corrections in atoms, rather than
relegating portions of it to the non-radiative recoil corrections. A
preliminary examination of the intrinsic deuteron radius obtained from
isotope-shift measurements suggests the presence of small meson-exchange
currents (exotic binding contributions of relativistic order) in the nuclear
charge operator, which contribute approximately 1/2%.
