set by noise, four in emission and two in absorption. Three of the emission

the 1720 MHz emission features are consistent with masers pumped by collisions
with molecular hydrogen at densities between 10^3 cm^{-3} and 10^5 cm^{-3}, and
T_k between 50 K and 250 K. The absorption and emission associated with the two

our neighbouring galaxy the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), appears to be
decreasing on a timescale of half a million year. This timescale is more than
two orders of magnitude smaller than what is expected from the standard theory
of tidal dissipation. Kumar and Quataert (1997a) proposed that this rapid
evolution can be understood provided that the neutron star's companion, a main
sequence B-star, has set up significant differential rotation. They showed that
the spin synchronization time for the B-star is similar to the orbit
circularization time, whereas the time to synchronize the surface rotation is
much shorter, and thus significant differential rotation in the star is indeed
expected. However, their calculation did not include the various processes that
can redistribute angular momentum in the star, possibly forcing it into solid
body rotation; in that case the dissipation of the tide would not be enhanced.
The goal of this paper is to include the redistribution of angular momentum in
the B-star due to meridional circulation and shear stresses and to calculate
the resulting rotation profile as a function of time. We find that although
angular momentum redistribution is important, the B-star continues to have
sufficient differential rotation so that tidal waves are entirely absorbed as
they arrive at the surface. The mechanism proposed by Kumar and Quataert to
speed up the orbital evolution of the SMC binary pulsar should therefore work
as suggested.

backscattering off local ion clusters, the static electron density response
chi(0,q) acquires a powerlaw divergence at q=2k_F even at T>0. This Fermi
surface singularity leads to an enhancement as well as to a systematical phase
shift of the Friedel oscillations, consistent with experiments. In addition,
the spatial decay exponent is reduced, strongly supporting the validity of a
HR-like mechanism at T>0. This effect may be accounted for in pseudopotential

interference and to better determine the resonance parameters of $\sigma(750)$

$|S|^2\Sigma$ with recoil nucleon transversities ``up'' and ``down'',
respectively. This work is the first attempt to determine resonance parameters
of a resonance from Breit-Wigner fits to production amplitudes of opposite
transversity. We used several fitting procedures to understand the resonant
structure of the S-wave amplitudes in this mass range. The simultaneous fit to
$|\bar S|^2\Sigma$ and $|S|^2\Sigma$ with two common $\sigma$ poles yields an
excellent fit with a lower $\chi^2/dpt$ than the separate fits. All amplitudes
are dominated by a $\sigma$ state with $m_\sigma = 786 \pm 24$ MeV and
$\Gamma_\sigma = 130\pm 47$ MeV. All amplitudes receive a weaker contribution
from a narrower $\sigma'$ state with $m_{\sigma'} = 670 \pm 30$ MeV and

$\sigma(786)$ with colour-electric and colour-magnetic modes of lowest mass

prove several new bounds on the violation of probability sum rules. The quantum
Zeno effect is also analysed within the consistent histories formalism and used
to demonstrate some of the difficulties involved in discussing approximate

are briefly discussed.
  The possibility of using the properties of the Schmidt decomposition to
define an algorithm which selects a single, physically natural, consistent set
for pure initial density matrices is investigated. The problems that arise are
explained, and different possible algorithms discussed. Their properties are
analysed with the aid of simple models. A set of computer programs is described

  Another algorithm is proposed that selects the consistent set (formed using
Schmidt projections) with the highest Shannon information. This is applied to a
simple model and shown to produce physically sensible histories. The theory is
capable of unconditional probabilistic prediction for closed quantum systems,
and is strong enough to be falsifiable. Ideas on applying the theory to more

bihamiltonian manifold. We consider the case of the manifolds associated with
the Gel'fand-Dickey theory, i.e., loop algebras over sl(n+1). We provide an
explicit identification, tailored on the MR reduction, of the
Adler-Gel'fand-Dickey brackets with the Poisson brackets on the MR-reduced
bihamiltonian manifold N. Such an identification relies on a suitable immersion
of the space of sections of the cotangent bundle of N into the algebra of
pseudo differential operators connected to geometrical features of the theory
of (classical) W_n algebras.
