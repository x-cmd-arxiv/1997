specially tailored for radial stellar pulsations. In the Lagrangean limit the
code reduces to the well tested Fraley scheme. The code has the useful feature
that unwanted, long lasting transients can be avoided by smoothly switching on
the adaptive mesh features starting from the Lagrangean code. Thus, a limit
cycle pulsation that can readily be computed with the relaxation method of
Stellingwerf will converge in a few tens of pulsation cycles when put into the
adaptive mesh code. The code has been checked with two shock problems, viz Noh
and Sedov, for which analytical solutions are known, and it has been found to
be both accurate and stable. Superior results were obtained through the
solution of the total energy (gravitational + kinetic + internal) equation
rather than that of the internal energy only.

absorption system toward the QSO 0850+4400. The redshift of the absorption
system is z = 0.163770 and the neutral hydrogen column density of the
absorption system is log N = 19.81 cm**-2. The absorption system is by far the
lowest redshift confirmed damped Lyman-alpha absorption system yet identified,
which provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the nature, impact
geometry, and kinematics of the absorbing galaxy in great detail. The
observations indicate that the absorption system is remarkable in three
respects: First, the absorption system is characterized by weak metal
absorption lines and a low metal abundance, possibly less than 4% of the solar
metal abundance. This cannot be explained as a consequence of dust, because the
neutral hydrogen column density of the absorption system is far too low for
obscuration by dust to introduce any significant selection effects. Second, the
absorption system is associated with a moderate-luminosity early-type S0
galaxy, although the absorption may actually arise in one of several very faint
galaxies detected very close to the QSO line of sight. Third, the absorbing
material moves counter to the rotating galaxy disk, which rules out the
possibility that the absorption arises in a thin or thick co-rotating gaseous
disk. These results run contrary to the expectation that low-redshift damped
Lyman-alpha absorption systems generally arise in the gas- and metal-rich inner
parts of late-type spiral galaxies. We suggest instead that mounting evidence
indicates that low-redshift galaxies of a variety of morphological types may
contain significant quantities of low metal abundance gas at large
galactocentric distances.

band, with both ROSAT and ASCA, reveal absorption by the warm absorber but
little or no neutral absorption expected to accompany the dust responsible for
the optical reddening. The dusty warm absorber solution to this discrepancy is
discussed and photoionization models of such warm absorbers are constructed.
The optical spectrum also displays the relatively strong `coronal' lines of
[FeX]6375, [FeXI]7892 and [FeXIV]5303. We show that these lines may plausibly
originate from the outer regions of the warm absorber, although better
calculations of the collision strengths for these transitions are required in

stellar system, with particular emphasis on dissipative processes analogous to
Landau damping. Assuming only that the response is causal, we show that the
irreversible work done by an external perturber is described by the
anti-Hermitian part of a linear response operator, and damping of collective
modes is described by the anti-Hermitian part of a related polarization
operator. We derive an exact formal expression for the response operator, which
is the classical analog of a well-known result in quantum statistical physics.
When the self-gravity of the response can be ignored, and the ensemble-averaged
gravitational potential is integrable, the expressions for the mode energy,
damping rate, and polarization operator reduce to well-known formulae derived
from perturbation theory in action-angle variables. In this approximation,
dissipation occurs only via resonant interaction with stellar orbits or
collective modes. For stellar systems in thermal equilibrium, the
anti-Hermitian part of the response operator is directly related to the
correlation function of the fluctuations. Thus dissipative properties of the
system are completely determined by the spectrum of density fluctuations---the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In particular, we express the coefficient of
dynamical friction for an orbiting test particle in terms of the fluctuation
spectrum; this reduces to the known Chandrasekhar formula in the restrictive
case of an infinite homogeneous system with a Maxwellian velocity distribution.

astrophysical systems. The theory employs gauge fields in a flat Minkowski
background spacetime to describe gravitational interactions. The iron
fluorescence line observed in AGN is discussed, assuming that the line
originates from matter in an accretion disk around a Kerr (rotating) black
hole. Gauge-theory gravity, expressed in the language of Geometric Algebra,
allows very efficient numerical calculation of photon paths. From these paths
we are able to infer the line shape of the iron line. Comparison with
observational data allows us to constrain the black hole parameters, and, for
the first time, infer an emissivity profile for the accretion disk. The
topological constraints imposed by gauge-theory gravity are exploited to
investigate the nature of the Kerr singularity. This reveals a simple physical
picture of a ring of matter moving at the speed of light which surrounds a
sheet of pure isotropic tension. Implications for the end-points of collapse
processes are discussed. Finally we consider rigidly-rotating cosmic strings.
It is shown that a solution in the literature has an unphysical stress-energy
tensor on the axis. Well defined solutions are presented for an ideal
two-dimensional fluid. The exterior vacuum solution admits closed timelike
curves and exerts a confining force.

open CDM (OCDM; Omega_0=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0); and spatially flat, low-density
CDM (LambdaCDM; Omega_0=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7). All models are normalised to
the local number density of rich clusters. Simulating gravitational lensing by
these clusters, we compute optical depths for the formation of large arcs. For
large arcs with length-to-width ratio >= 10, the optical depth is largest for
OCDM. Relative to OCDM, the optical depth is lower by about an order of
magnitude for LambdaCDM, and by about two orders of magnitude for S/tauCDM.
These differences originate from the different epochs of cluster formation

  Four-dimensional case","65 pages. LaTeX with one postscript figure",,,"KUNS-1446, HE(TH) 97/09","hep-lat",,"  Dynamical nature of the gauge degree of freedom and its effect to fermion
spectrum are studied for four-dimensional nonabelian chiral gauge theory in the
vacuum overlap formulation. The covariant gauge fixing term and the
Faddeev-Popov determinant are introduced by hand as a weight for the gauge
average. At $\beta=\infty$, as noticed by Hata some time ago, the model is
renormalizable at one-loop and the gauge fixing term turns into an
asymptotically free self-coupling of the gauge freedom, even in the presence of
the gauge symmetry breaking of the complex phase of chiral determinant. The
severe infrared divergence occurs in the perturbation expansion and it prevents
local order parameters from emerging. The Foerster-Nielsen-Ninomiya mechanism
works in this perturbative framework: the small explicit gauge symmetry
breaking term does not affect the above infrared structure. Based on these
dynamical features, which is quite similar to the two-dimensional nonlinear
sigma model, we assume that the global gauge symmetry does not break
spontaneously and the gauge freedom acquires mass dynamically. The asymptotic
freedom allows us to tame the gauge fluctuation by approaching the critical
point of the gauge freedom without spoiling its disordered nature. Then it is
argued that the disordered gauge freedom does not necessarily cause the
massless chiral state in the (waveguide) boundary correlation function and that
the entire fermion spectrum can be chiral.

supersymmetric gauge theories, the so-called NSVZ beta functions. Shifman and
Vainshtein (SV) further related these beta functions to the exact 1-loop

somewhat mysterious. We attempt to clarify these issues by presenting new
perspectives on the NSVZ beta function. Our interpretation of the results is
somewhat different than the one given by SV, having nothing to do with the
distinction between ""Wilsonian"" and ""1PI"" effective actions. Throughout we work
in the context of the Wilsonian Renormalization Group; namely, as the cutoff of
the theory is changed from M to M', we determine the appropriate changes in the
bare couplings needed to keep the low energy physics fixed. The entire analysis
is therefore free of infrared subtleties. When the bare Lagrangian given at the
cutoff is manifestly holomorphic in the gauge coupling, we show that the
required change in the holomorphic gauge coupling is exhausted at 1-loop to all
orders of perturbation theory, and even non-perturbatively in some cases. On
the other hand, when the bare Lagrangian has canonically normalized kinetic
terms, we find that the required change in the gauge coupling is given by the
NSVZ beta function. The higher order contributions in the NSVZ beta function
are due to anomalous Jacobians under the rescaling of the fields done in
passing from holomorphic to canonical normalization. We also give prescriptions
for regularizing certain N=1 theories with an ultraviolet cutoff M preserving
manifest holomorphy, starting from finite N=4 and N=2 theories. It is then in
principle possible to check the validity of the exact beta function by higher
order calculations in these theories.

latter includes the Abelianization of the first class constraints, putting the
second class constraints into the canonical form and performing a canonical
transformation to a set of adapted coordinates such that a subset of the new
canonical pairs coincides with the second class constraints and part of the new
momenta is equal to the Abelian constraints. In the adapted basis the pure
gauge degrees of freedom automatically drop out from the consideration after
projection of the model onto the constraint shell. Apart from the elimination
of these ignorable degrees of freedom a further Hamiltonian reduction is
achieved due to the three dimensional group of rigid symmetry possessed by the
system.

  Cosmology session of the Eighth Marcel Grossmann Meeting (June 1997)",,,"DSF preprint 97/32","hep-th",,"  A crucial problem in quantum cosmology is a careful analysis of the one-loop
semiclassical approximation for the wave function of the universe, after an
appropriate choice of mixed boundary conditions. The results for Euclidean
quantum gravity in four dimensions are here presented, when linear covariant
gauges are implemented by means of the Faddeev-Popov formalism. On using
zeta-function regularization and a mode-by-mode analysis, one finds a result
for the one-loop divergence which agrees with the Schwinger-DeWitt method only
after taking into account the non-trivial effect of gauge and ghost modes. For
the gravitational field, however, the geometric form of heat-kernel asymptotics
with boundary conditions involving tangential derivatives of metric
perturbations is still unknown. Moreover, boundary effects are found to be
responsible for the lack of one-loop finiteness of simple supergravity, when
only one bounding three-surface occurs. This work raises deep interpretative
issues about the admissible backgrounds and about quantization techniques in
quantum cosmology.

beyond hadron gas dynamics. The systematics of strangeness production indicates
that energy and baryon density are key variables while the size of the
