cone of Calabi-Yau threefolds via symplectic methods. For instance, it is shown
that if two Calabi-Yau threefolds are general in complex moduli and are
symplectic deformations of each other, then their Kaehler cones are the same.
The results are generalizations of those in the author's previous paper ""The
Kaehler cone on Calabi-Yau threefolds"" (Inventiones math. 107 (1992), 561-583;
Erratum: Inventiones math. 114 (1993), 231-233), where the behaviour of the
Kaehler cone under deformations of the complex structure was studied -- these
results may be recovered as a special case from this manuscript.
  The techniques used involve studying tamed almost complex deformations of the
complex structure on the Calabi-Yau threefold, and in particular proving the
non-vanishing of certain Gromov-Witten invariants, associated to codimension
one faces of the Kaehler cone. This in turn involves a detailed study of
primitive contractions on a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold, in particular for the
case of Type III contractions. More detailed information concerning
Gromov-Witten invariants associated to codimension one faces of the Kaehler
cone may be found in a recent preprint of the author.

  threefolds","20 pages, latex2e, minor changes to previous version",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We investigate Gromov-Witten invariants associated to exceptional classes for
primitive birational contractions on a Calabi-Yau threefold X. It was observed
in a previous paper that these invariants are locally defined, in that they can
be calculated from knowledge of an open neighbourhood of the exceptional locus
of the contraction; in this paper, we make this explicit.
  For Type I contractions (i.e. only finitely many exceptional curves), a
method is given for calculating the Gromov-Witten invariants, and these in turn
yield explicit expressions for the changes in the cubic form $D^3$ and the
linear form $D.c_2$ under the corresponding flop. For Type III contractions
(when a divisor E is contracted to a smooth curve C of singularities), there
are only two relevant Gromov-Witten numbers n(1) and n(2). Here n(2) is the
number (suitably defined) of simple pseudo-holomorphic rational curves
representing the class of a fibre of E over C, and n(1) the number of simple
curves representing half this class. Explicit formulae for n(1) and n(2) are
given (n(1) in terms of the singular fibres of E over C and n(2)=2g(C)-2). An
easy proof of these formulae is provided when g(C)>0. The main part of the
paper then gives a proof valid in general (including the case g(C)=0).

  Physical Review E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.56.2722",,"astro-ph chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  Time-independent Hamiltonian flows are viewed as geodesic flows in a curved
manifold, so that the onset of chaos hinges on properties of the curvature
two-form entering into the Jacobi equation. Attention focuses on ensembles of
orbit segments evolved in 2-D potentials, examining how various orbital
properties correlate with the mean value and dispersion, <K> and k, of the
trace K of the curvature. Unlike most analyses, which have attributed chaos to
negative curvature, this work exploits the fact that geodesics can be chaotic
even if K is everywhere positive, chaos arising as a parameteric instability
triggered by regular variations in K along the orbit. For ensembles of fixed
energy, with both regular and chaotic segments, simple patterns connect the
values of <K> and k for different segments, both with each other and with the
short time Lyapunov exponent X. Often, but not always, there is a near one-to-
one correlation between <K> and k, a plot of these quantities approximating a
simple curve. X varies smoothly along this curve, chaotic segments located
furthest from the regular regions tending systematically to have the largest
X's. For regular orbits, <K> and k also vary smoothly with ``distance'' from
the chaotic phase space regions, as probed, e.g., by the location of the
initial condition on a surface of section. Many of these observed properties
can be understood qualitatively in terms of a one-dimensional Mathieu equation.

  Importantly also, the method allows us to quantify an irregular signal which
has the potential benefit for extracting novel stellar constraints from an
irregular light-curve.
  Finally, from the low dimensionality 4 of the flow we can infer a simple
physical picture of the pulsations, and arguments are presented that the
pulsations of R Sct are the result of the nonlinear interaction of two
vibrational normal modes of the star.

which persists as late as 175 days. This is responsible for the well-known red
J-H colour. To identify the emission features and test the $^{56}$Ni hypothesis
for the explosion and subsequent light curve, we compare the NIR and optical
nebular-phase data with a simple non-LTE nebular spectral model. We find that
many of the spectral features are due to iron-group elements and that the
J-band deficit is due to a lack of emission lines from species which dominate
the rest of the IR/optical spectrum. Nevertheless, some emission is unaccounted
for, possibly due to inaccuracies in the cobalt atomic data. For some
supernovae, blueshifts of 1000--3000 km/s are seen in infrared and optical
features at 3 months. We suggest this is due to clumping in the ejecta. The
evolution of the cobalt/iron mass ratio indicates that $^{56}$Co-decay
dominates the abundances of these elements. The absolute masses of iron-group
elements which we derive support the basic thermonuclear explosion scenario for
Type Ia supernovae. A core-collapse origin is less consistent with our data.

following: is $W_r(\{G\},q) = q^{-1}W(\{G\},q)$ analytic or not at the origin

question is also relevant in statistical mechanics because
$W(\{G\},q)=\exp(S_0/k_B)$, where $S_0$ is the ground state entropy of the
$q$-state Potts antiferromagnet on the lattice graph $\{G\}$, and the
analyticity of $W_r(\{G\},q)$ at $1/q=0$ is necessary for the large-$q$ series
expansions of $W_r(\{G\},q)$. Although $W_r$ is analytic at $1/q=0$ for many
$\{G\}$, there are some $\{G\}$ for which it is not; for these, $W_r$ has no
large-$q$ series expansion. It is important to understand the reason for this
nonanalyticity. Here we give a general condition that determines whether or not
a particular $W_r(\{G\},q)$ is analytic at $1/q=0$ and explains the
nonanalyticity where it occurs. We also construct infinite families of graphs

up to N=2048, system sizes are up to $2^{21}$ lattice sites and $2.8\times
10^5$ monomers. These simulations used the recently introduced pruned-enriched
Rosenbluth method which proved extremely efficient, together with a histogram
method for estimating finite size corrections. Our most clear result is that
chains at the critical point are Gaussian for large $N$, having end-to-end
distances $R\sim\sqrt{N}$. Also the distance $T_\Theta-T_c(N)$ (where $T_\Theta
= \lim_{N\to\infty} T_c(N)$) scales with the mean field exponent, $T_\Theta
-T_c(N)\sim 1/\sqrt{N}$. The critical density seems to scale with a non-trivial
exponent similar to that observed in experiments. But we argue that this is due
to large logarithmic corrections. These corrections are similar to the very
large corrections to scaling seen in recent analyses of $\Theta$-polymers, and
qualitatively predicted by the field theoretic renormalization group. The only
serious deviation from this simple global picture concerns the N-dependence of
the order parameter amplitudes which disagrees with a minimalistic ansatz of de
Gennes. But this might be due to problems with finite size scaling. We find
that the finite size dependence of the density of states $P(E,n)$ (where $E$ is
the total energy and $n$ is the number of chains) is slightly but significantly

We also give the arguments against the delocalization transition in the Fock

used for experimental confirmation of the below-Golden-Rule decay.

tensor, is obtained by integrating photon geodesics from last scattering to the
point of observation today. This improves and extends earlier work by Russ et
al where a similar formula was obtained by taking first order variations of the
redshift. In the case of scalar (density) perturbations, $E_{ab}$ is related to
the harmonic components of the gravitational potential $\Phi_k$ and the usual
dominant Sachs-Wolfe contribution $\delta T_R/\bar{T}_R\sim\Phi_k$ to the
temperature anisotropy is recovered, together with contributions due to the
time variation of the potential (Rees-Sciama effect), entropy and velocity
perturbations at last scattering and a pressure suppression term important in
low density universes. We also explicitly demonstrate the validity of assuming
that the perturbations are adiabatic at decoupling and show that if the surface
of last scattering is correctly placed and the background universe model is
taken to be a flat dust dominated Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model (FRW), then
the large scale temperature anisotropy can be interpreted as being due to the
motion of the matter relative to the surface of constant temperature which
defines the surface of last scattering on those scales.

characterized by a loss, a quantity that depends on the channel input and the
quantum operation performed by the channel. The loss reflects the transmission
quality: if the loss is zero, quantum information can be perfectly transmitted
at a rate measured by the quantum source entropy. By using block coding based
on sequences of n entangled symbols, the average loss (defined as the overall
loss of the joint n-symbol channel divided by n, when n tends to infinity) can
be made lower than the loss for a single use of the channel. In this context,
we examine several upper bounds on the rate at which quantum information can be
transmitted reliably via a noisy channel, that is, with an asymptotically
vanishing average loss while the one-symbol loss of the channel is non-zero.
These bounds on the channel capacity rely on the entropic Singleton bound on
quantum error-correcting codes [Phys. Rev. A 56, 1721 (1997)]. Finally, we
analyze the Singleton bounds when the noisy quantum channel is supplemented

Including external potentials yields the Schrodinger equation, which, in this
context, is arbitrary due to internal energy components. The uncertainty
relations are an expression of this, fundamental, arbitrariness. Electrons and
photons can be described by an identical formalism, providing formulations
equivalent to the Maxwell equations. Electrostatic interactions justify the
initial assumption of electron-wave stability: the stability of electron waves
can be referred to vanishing intrinsic fields of interaction. Aspect's
experimental proof of non-locality is rejected, because these measurements
