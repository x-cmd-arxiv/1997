X-1 from 3.0 to 200 keV, using data from a 10 ksec observation by the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer. The spectrum can be well described phenomenologically by
an exponentially cut-off power law with a photon index Gamma = 1.45 +/- 0.02 (a
value considerably harder than typically found), e-folding energy E_fold = 162
+/- 9 keV, plus a deviation from a power law that formally can be modeled as a
thermal blackbody with temperature kT_bb = 1.2 +/1 0.2 keV. Although the 3 - 30
keV portion of the spectrum can be fit with a reflected power law with Gamma =
1.81 +/- 0.01 and covering fraction f = 0.35 +/- 0.02, the quality of the fit
is significantly reduced when the HEXTE data in the 30 - 100 keV range is
included, as there is no observed hardening in the power law within this energy
range. As a physical description of this system, we apply the accretion disc
corona models of Dove, Wilms & Begelman (1997) --- where the temperature of the
corona is determined self-consistently. A spherical corona with a total optical
depth tau = 1.6 +/- 0.1 and an average temperature kT_c = 87 +/- 5 keV,
surrounded by an exterior cold disc, does provide a good description of the
data (reduced chi-squared = 1.55). These models deviate from the data by up to
7% in the 5 - 10 keV range, and we discuss possible reasons for these
discrepancies. However, considering how successfully the spherical corona
reproduces the 10 - 200 keV data, such ``photon-starved'' coronal geometries
seem very promising for explaining the accretion processes of Cygnus X-1.

predict a bulk flow of ICM gas that has sufficient dynamic pressure for bending

that the amplitude of the color curve used in the solution is larger than ~0.3

find an unweighted mean value of the distance ratio of 1.02 +- 0.04. A detailed

clear evidence that four Cepheids are not cluster members (SZ Tau, T Mon, U Car

the former evidence for cluster membership was only weak. After rejection of
non-members, we find a weighted mean distance ratio of 0.969 +- 0.014, with a

potential of a filled gas disk. The method is based on a higher order harmonic
expansion of the full velocity field of the disk. This expansion is made by
first fitting a tilted-ring model to the velocity field of the gas disk and
subsequently expanding the velocity field along each ring into its harmonic
terms. We use epicycle theory to derive equations for the harmonic terms in a
distorted potential. The phase of each component of the distortion can vary
with radius. We show that if the potential has a distortion of harmonic number
m, the velocity field as seen on the sky exhibits an m-1 and m+1 distortion. As
is to be expected, the effects of a global elongation of the halo are similar
to an m=2 spiral arm. The main difference is that the phase of the spiral arm
can vary with radius. Our method allows a measurement of epsilon_pot sin(2
phi_2), where epsilon_pot is the elongation of the potential and phi_2 is one
of the viewing angles. Using \hi data, one can probe the potential at radii
beyond the stellar disk, into the regime where dark matter is thought to be the
dominant dynamical component. The method is applied the spiral galaxies NGC
2403 and NGC 3198 and the harmonic terms are measured up to ninth order. We
find epsilon_pot sin(2 phi_2) to be 0.064 +/- 0.003 for NGC 2403 and 0.019 +/-
0.003 for NGC 3198. More galaxies should be examined to separate viewing angle

liquid channels, with transverse displacements and density (``permeation

renormalization group calculations in two and three dimensions for an
approximate model of the smectic. The finite temperature behavior is much less
glassy than in equilibrium, owing to a disorder-driven effective ``heating''
(allowed by the absence of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem). This, in
conjunction with the permeation mode, leads to a fundamentally analytic
transverse response for $T>0$. Our results are compared to recent experiments

two-peak structure in the imaginary part of the self-energy. From the imaginary
part of the self-energy we conclude that our system is a Fermi liquid (for the
temperature investigated here), since Im$\Sigma(\vec{k},\omega) \approx w^2$
around the chemical potential. We have compared our fully self-consistent FLEX
solutions with a lower order approximation where the internal Green functions
are approximated by free Green functions. These two approches, i.e., the fully

of view that `experience only makes statements of this type: an observer has
made a certain observation; and never any like this: a physical quantity has a
certain value.' The supposition that the observables of a system `possess'
objective values is purely idealistic. According to the SI view, the state-
vector collapse cannot result from the Schroedinger evolution of a system (even
with its environment), but only from the empirical production of a mathematical
symbol, irreducible to the quantum level. The production of a symbol always
takes some time. Thus the state-vector collapse cannot be instantaneous
(Schneider 1994), a specific prediction of the present model.
  From this interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the appearances of the body
are the result of state-vector collapses of several types, i.e. the production
of different kinds of symbols. In fact the universe of symbols is very rich: a
symbol can have a conceptual `value' (like in physics and then give rise to a
measurement), or other qualitative values (like in many human behaviors). In
the latter case, the Semiotic Interpretation of QM gives a way to understand
how a mental representation can modify the state of the body.
