provides an ideal laboratory for testing the universal density profile
prediction from high resolution numerical simulations of hierarchical

noted, or at large radii. We advocate a resolution of this dilemma by
postulating the existence of a dark spheroid of baryons amounting to several
times the mass of the observed disk component and comparable to that of the
cold dark matter halo component. Such an additional mass component provides an
excellent fit to the rotation curve provided that the outer halo is still cold
dark matter-dominated with a density profile and mass-radius scaling relation
as predicted by standard CDM-dominated models. The universal existence of such

universal rotation curves observed in spiral galaxies, may have a similar

their formation mechanism. The `main sequence', consisting of spirals,

sequence are primarily determined by the distributions of the angular momentum
and formation time of dark haloes. They are well reproduced by current
cosmogonies provided that galaxies form late, at $z \la 2$. In this scenario,
dwarf ellipticals were small `disks' at $z\sim 1$ and become `ellipticals'
after they fall into cluster environments. The strong clustering of dwarf
ellipticals is then a natural by-product of the merging and transformation
process. The number of dwarf galaxies predicted in a cluster such as Virgo is
in good agreement with the observed number. On the other hand, the `giant
branch', consisting of giant ellipticals and bulges, is probably produced by
the merging of disk galaxies. Based on the observed phase-space densities of
galaxies, we show that the main bodies of all giant ellipticals can be produced
by dissipationless mergers of high-redshift disks. However, high-redshift
disks, although denser than present-day ones, are still not compact enough to
produce the high central phase space density of some low-luminosity
ellipticals. Dissipation must have occurred in the central parts of these

component resulting from the tidal interaction and a component that is related
to dynamical friction. When the satellite orbits outside the galaxy, we derive
the force in the impulse approximation. In penetrating shortlived encounters,
the wake excited in the density field is responsible for most of the

in terms of an effective Coulomb logarithm which now depends on the dynamical

potential among stars. The dynamics of the satellite is computed
self-consistently. We determine the conditions for tidal capture of a satellite

pair, stability against orbital decay is lost near resonance. The time scale of
binary coalescence is computed as a function of the eccentricity and mass

magnetic phase in semiconductor double quantum wells in which each well is
spin-polarized and the polarization vectors are antiparallel. Magnetic
instabilities are a general feature of Coulombic double quantum well systems at
low densities. We argue that this antiferromagnetic phase is stabilized
relative to ferromagnetic ones by an effective superexchange interaction
between the wells. Detailed self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations using a
point-contact model for the interaction show that the antiferromagnetic phase
survives intra-subband repulsion matrix elements neglected in earlier work in a
large portion of the model's parameter space. We also examine the role of
asymmetry due to biasing or to differences in the widths of the two quantum
wells. The asymmetry creates a mode coupling between the intra- and
inter-subband collective spin-density excitations (SDEs) which changes the
Raman spectroscopy signature of the phase transition from a complete softening
of the inter-subband SDE to a cusp as the density is tuned through the
transition. This cusp may be detectable in inelastic light scattering
experiments in samples of sufficient quality at low enough temperatures and
densities.

fundamentally altered upon addition of even a small amount of charge. The added
charges agglomerate along domain walls at which the spin correlations, which
may or may not remain long-ranged, suffer a $\pi$ phase shift. In two
dimensions, these domain walls are ``stripes'' which are either insulating, or
conducting, i.e. metallic rivers with their own low energy degrees of freedom.
However, quasi one-dimensional metals typically undergo a transition to an
insulating ordered charge density wave (CDW) state at low temperatures. Here it
is shown that such a transition is eliminated if the zero-point energy of
transverse stripe fluctuations is sufficiently large in comparison to the CDW
coupling between stripes. As a consequence, there exist novel,
liquid-crystalline low-temperature phases -- an electron smectic, with
crystalline order in one direction, but liquid-like correlations in the other,
and an electron nematic with orientational order but no long-range positional
order. These phases, which constitute new states of matter, can be either high

release mechanism, spatial inhomogeneity of the entanglement constraints, and
tracer polymer shape fluctuations. The entanglement corrections to the single
polymer Rouse dynamics are shown to depend on molecular weight via the ratio
N/N_e, where the entanglement degree of polymerization, N_e, can be measured
from the plateau shear modulus. Two microscopically defined non-universal
parameters, an entanglement strength 1/alpha and a length scale ratio, delta=

The variation of tracer dielectric relaxation times from Rouse to

is on the spectrum of massive states, that are realized as two-branes ending on
the five-brane. We start with a determination of the supersymmetries that are
left unbroken by the background metric and five-brane. We then show how the
central charge of the N = 2 algebra arises from the central charge associated
with the M-theory two-brane. This determines the condition for a two-brane
configuration to be BPS-saturated in the four-dimensional sense. By imposing
certain conditions on the moduli, we can give concrete examples of such
two-branes. This leads us to conjecture that vectormultiplet and hypermultiplet
BPS-saturated states correspond to two-branes with the topology of a cylinder
and a disc respectively. We also discuss the phenomenon of marginal stability
of BPS-saturated states.

All previously known non trivials bounds of $rank_a(J_0^n(q))$ assumed the

states begin to stabilize in the ultra-intense field limit. The pulses
considered are essentially arbitrary, but we distinguish between three
situations. First the total classical momentum transfer is non-vanishing,
second not both the total classical momentum transfer and the total classical
displacement are vanishing together with the requirement that the potential has
a finite number of bound states and third both the total classical momentum
transfer and the total classical displacement are vanishing. For the first two
cases we rigorously prove, that the ionization probability tends to one when
the amplitude of the pulse tends to infinity and the pulse shape remains fixed.
In the third case the limit is strictly smaller than one. This case is also
related to the high frequency limit considered by Gavrila et al.
