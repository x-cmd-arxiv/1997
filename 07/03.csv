galaxies of the Hubble sequence. Its main originality is the extension to the
near-infrared (NIR) of the atlas of synthetic spectra of Rocca-Volmerange &
Guiderdoni (1988) with a revised stellar library including cold star parameters
and stellar tracks extended to the TP-AGB and the post-AGB phase. The NIR is
coherently linked to the visible and the ultraviolet, so that the model is
continuous on an exceptionally large wavelength range from 220 A up to 5
microns. Moreover, a precise algorithm allows to follow very rapid evolutionary
phases such as red supergiants or AGB crucial in the NIR. The nebular component
is also computed in the NIR. The extinction correction is gas-dependent for
spirals and ellipticals. A set of reference synthetic spectra at z=0, to which
apply cosmological k- and evolution e- corrections for high-redshift galaxies,
is built from fits of observational templates. Because of the lack of visible
to NIR spectral templates for each Hubble type, we adopt statistical samples of
colors, not fitted by previous models. A first application of this continuous
model is to solve the problem of the slope of the bright galaxy counts from
B=15 to 19 and of the normalization parameter of the Schechter luminosity
function. Code sources, input and output data are available by anonymous ftp or

central velocity dispersions (sigma) and magnesium line strength indices (Mg).
Internal errors (derived from repeat observations) are 7.6% on each measurement
of sigma, and 0.010 mag on each Mg measurement. We correct the major published
datasets to a standard aperture size, and define a new `standard system' by the
aperture-corrected Lick data of Davies et al. Through extensive
intercomparisons with data from the literature, we present the corrections
required to bring the major published datasets onto the standard system. We
demonstrate that our new velocity dispersion data can be brought into
consistency with the standard system, to an uncertainty of <0.01 dex. From
R-band CCD photometry, we derive effective diameter (A_e), mean surface
brightness within effective diameter (mu_e) and an R-band diameter equivalent
to the D_n parameter of Dressler et al. Internal comparisons indicate an
average error of 0.005 in each measurement of log(D_n). The combination
log(A_e) - 0.3 mu_e, approximately the quantity used in the Fundamental Plane
distance indicator, has an uncertainty of 0.006 per measurement. The
photometric data can be brought onto a system consistent with external data at
the level of 0.5% in distance. These data will be used in a companion paper to
derive distance and peculiar velocity estimates for the nine clusters studied.

elliptical with a prominent nucleus and broad emission lines.

forming stars at a prodigious rate compared with nearby normal galaxies. We
discuss the implications of our detections for the history of star and heavy
element formation in the universe. Although uncertainties in the calibration,
reliability of source detection, associations, and starburst models remain, it
is clear that dust plays an important role in star formation out to redshift 1

cosmological constant, the limit using only radio data is Omega_0 > 0.27 at

consistent with those for lensed quasars, and the combined radio + optical
sample requires Omega_0 > 0.38 at 2-sigma (0.64 < Omega_0 < 1.66 at 1-sigma)

ionization (NEI) thermal model for a shocked plasma of temperature kT ~ 0.3

spectrally-resolved images, at the location of 1E~161348-5055. A black-body
model fit to the source spectrum yields a temperature kT = 0.6 keV, with an
unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV luminosity of Lx ~ 10E34 erg/s (for an assumed distance
of 3.3 kpc, both of which are at least a factor of 2 higher than predicted by
cooling neutron star models. Alternatively, a power-law model for the source
continuum gives a steep photon index of ~ 3.2, similar to that of other
radio-quiet, hard X-ray point sources associated with supernova remnants.

stellar systems varies as a (K times M^{-4/3}; the ``zone of exclusion'').
Galaxies march away from ZOE as a function of Hubble type: DHGs closest,
Sm-Irr's furthest away. We test current ideas of galaxy formation via
hierarchical clustering and merging and find them to be broadly consistent with
the properties of the cosmic metaplane. Four key questions are raised by this

Why do galaxies march away from the ZOE? Why are isotropic galaxies only found

the cosmic metaplane? This study is but the first step along a long road,
limited by existing data to the B passband of major stellar systems, whose

We consider three models in order to assess the non-repeating, narrowband
events found in recent SETI and to analyze large surveys in general: (I)
Radiometer noise; (II) A population of constant Galactic sources undergoing
interstellar scintillation,; and (III) Real, transient signals (or hardware
errors) of either terrestrial or ET origin.
  We apply likelihood and Bayesian tests of the models to The Planetary
Society/Harvard META data. We find that Models II and III are both highly
preferred to Model I, but that Models II and III are about equally likely.
Ruling out Model II in favor of Model III requires many more reobservations
than were conducted in META *or* the reobservation threshold must be much lower
than was used in META. *We cannot rule out the possibility that META events are
real, intrinsically steady ETI signals.*
  We recommend that future surveys use thresholds far below the typical
false-alarm threshold to lessen the effects of intermittency. The threshold

at what level one may expect systematic errors to occur in the Hipparcos

parallaxes in terms of distances and luminosities of stars. What are the biases
one should be aware of and how can these be corrected? When using the
astrometric data to study the statistics of stars one should take the full
covariance matrix of the errors on the astrometric parameters into account. We
explain how to do this and discuss the specific case of a moving cluster.
Finally, we address the question of the correlation of astrometric parameters

backtracked from the detector, at the Earth, to the halo of the Galaxy. We
assume an axisymmetric, large scale spiral magnetic field permeating both the
disc and the halo. A normal field component to the galactic plane ($B_z$) is
also included in part of the simulations. We find that the presence of a large
scale galactic magnetic field does not generally affect the arrival directions
of the protons, although the inclusion of a $B_z$ component may cause
significant deflection of the lower energy protons ($E = 4 \times 10^{19} $
eV). Error boxes larger than or equal to $\sim 5^{\circ}$ are most expected in
this case. On the other hand, in the case of heavy nuclei, the arrival
direction of the particles is strongly dependent on the coordinates of the
particle source. The deflection may be high enough ($> 20^{\circ}$) as to make
extremely difficult any identification of the sources unless the real magnetic
field configuration is accurately determined. Moreover, not every incoming
particle direction is allowed between a given source and the detector. This
generates sky patches which are virtually unobservable from the Earth. In the
particular case of the UHE events of Yakutsk, Fly's Eye, and Akeno, they come
from locations for which the deflection caused by the assumed magnetic field is
not significant.

function of the density of their environment. The observable image distortions
are a consequence of the interplay between the effects of a global cluster mass
distribution and the perturbations due to individual cluster galaxies. Starting
from a reconstruction of the cluster mass distribution with conventional
techniques, we apply a maximum likelihood method to infer the average
properties of an ensemble of cluster galaxies. From simulations this approach
is found to be reliable as long as the galaxies including their dark matter
haloes only contribute a small fraction to the total mass of the system. If
their haloes are extended, the galaxies contain a substantial mass fraction. In
this case our method is still applicable in the outer regions of clusters,
where the surface mass density is low, but yields biased estimates of the
parameters describing the mass profiles of the cluster galaxies in the central
part of the cluster. In that case it will be necessary to resort to more
sophisticated strategies by modelling cluster galaxies and an underlying global
mass distribution simultaneously. We conclude that galaxy-galaxy lensing in
clusters provides a unique means to probe the presence and extent of dark
haloes of cluster galaxies.

model: both \chi_P and \chi_V are enhanced by a factor of 1/z (z is the

Riemannian manifold. The field equations are $R^\mu_\nu = 0$ i.e. Ricci's
curvature tensor vanishes. The field equations have to be augmented by natural
physical requirements like orientability, time orientability and existence of a
spinorial structure. Moreover, it is impossible to define the energy of the
gravity field only by the metric tensor. We suggest to impose an additional
structure and consider parallelizable manifold i.e. manifolds for which a
smooth field of frames exists. The derivation of the field equations is by an
action principle. A Lagrangian, which is quadratic in the differentials, is
defined. The minimum of the action is achieved at a $16 \times 16$ second order
quasi linear system. It is of Laplacian type. The system admits a unique exact
solution for a centrally symmetric, static and assimptotically flat field. The
resulting metric is the celebrated Rosen metric, which is very close to the
Schwarzchild metric. The two are intrinsicly different since the scalar
curvature of the Schuarzschild metric is zero, in contrast to Rosen's which is
positive. The suggested field admits black holes which are briefly discussed.

-1/2 <= x <= 1/2 and |z|>=1} of PSL(2,Z). The cutting sequence for a vertical
geodesic {\theta+it: t > 0} is related to a one-dimensional continued fraction
expansion for \theta, called the one-dimensional Minkowski geodesic continued
fraction (MGCF) expansion, which is associated to a parametrized family of
reduced bases of a family of 2-dimensional lattices. The set of cutting
sequences for all geodesics forms a two-sided shift in a symbol space {L,R,J}
which has the same set of forbidden blocks as for vertical geodesics. We show
that this shift is not a sofic shift, and that it characterizes the fundamental
domain F up to an isometry of the hyperbolic plane H. We give conversion
methods between the cutting sequence for the vertical geodesic {\theta+it: t >
0}, the MGCF expansion of \theta and the additive ordinary continued fraction
(ACF) expansion of \theta. We show that the cutting sequence and MGCF
expansions can each be computed from the other by a finite automaton, and the
ACF expansion of \theta can be computed from the cutting sequence for the
vertical geodesic \theta+it by a finite automaton. However, the cutting
sequence for a vertical geodesic cannot be computed from the ACF expansion by
any finite automaton, but there is an algorithm to compute its first l symbols
when given as input the first O(l) symbols of the ACF expansion, which takes
time O(l^2) and space O(l).
