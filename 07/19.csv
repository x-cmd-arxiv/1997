  http://hea-www.harvard.edu/QEDT/niel/papers/papers.html",,"10.1093/mnras/292.2.407",,"astro-ph",,"  We present evidence for X-ray absorption by ionized oxygen in ASCA spectra of
the prototype infrared quasar IRAS 13349+2438. This powerful (2E46 erg/s)
quasar was studied in detail with ROSAT, and the combination of the X-ray data
and optical/near-infrared spectropolarimetry strongly suggested the presence of
a dusty ionized (`warm') absorber along the line of sight to the central X-ray
source. The ASCA spectra, in contrast to an earlier claim, show evidence for
ionized oxygen edges, and the presence of such edges appears to provide the
most physically plausible interpretation of the data. Thus, the ASCA spectra
support the dusty warm absorber hypothesis. The ASCA data also allow the
physical properties of the warm absorber to be constrained far better than
before. A one-zone warm absorber model indicates the ionized column to be in
the range (2--6) x 10^{21} cm^{-2}, and it gives an ionization parameter of
xi=31^{+12}_{-12} erg cm s^{-1}. The dusty warm absorber appears to have a
density below 3E8 cm^{-3}, and it is probably located outside the broad-line
region. The dust in the warm absorber does not appear to have been heavily
sputtered or destroyed via other means. Based on the ASCA fitting, we suggest
that ultraviolet absorption lines from the warm absorber may be detectable and
discuss how they can further constrain the warm absorber properties. We compare
and contrast the X-ray properties of IRAS 13349+2438 with those of broad
absorption line quasars. We comment on the steep > 2 keV continuum of IRAS
13349+2438 and examine the relevance to some models of radiative Fe II
formation.

expansion performed in the new basis follows. The method is successfully tested
using both the Heisenberg model and the $t-J$ model with holes on 2-leg ladders

technique is its ability to calculate dynamical responses on clusters larger
than those that can be studied using Exact Diagonalization. The method is

spin response of 2x16 ladders. The former two values are in good agreement with

imposing boundary conditions on the potential, and on the ghost fields. The
scheme requires that temporal and tangential components of perturbations of the
potential should vanish at the boundary, jointly with the gauge-averaging
functional, first chosen of the Lorenz type. Gauge invariance of such boundary
conditions is then obtained provided that the ghost fields vanish at the
boundary. Normal and longitudinal modes of the potential obey an entangled
system of eigenvalue equations, whose solution is a linear combination of
Bessel functions under the above assumptions, and with the help of the Feynman
choice for a dimensionless gauge parameter. Interestingly, ghost modes cancel
exactly the contribution to the Casimir energy resulting from transverse and
temporal modes of the potential, jointly with the decoupled normal mode of the
potential. Moreover, normal and longitudinal components of the potential for
the interior and the exterior problem give a result in complete agreement with
the one first found by Boyer, who studied instead boundary conditions involving
TE and TM modes of the electromagnetic field. The coupled eigenvalue equations
for perturbative modes of the potential are also analyzed in the axial gauge,
and for arbitrary values of the gauge parameter. The set of modes which
contribute to the Casimir energy is then drastically changed, and comparison
with the case of a flat boundary sheds some light on the key features of the
Casimir energy in non-covariant gauges.
