~1 \sigma below the simulations in each of eight density bins, formally ruling
out this model at the 7.4 \sigma level, quantifying the well-known problem that
this model produces too high a velocity dispersion. This comparison is
insensitive to the normalization of the power spectrum, although it is quite
sensitive to the density and velocity bias of galaxies relative to dark matter

constitute a new class of pulsating stars. These stars typically have periods
between 0.5 and 3 days with V-band variability of several hundredths of a
magnitude. Given the time scale of the variability, the pulsations would have
to be non-radial gravity-mode pulsations. The pulsational nature of some of
these stars has been proven by means of coordinated multi-longitude photometric
campaigns, radial velocity (RV) variations and line profile (LP) variations,
indicating low degree spherical harmonics ($\ell$ = 3 or less). Evidence is
that these stars are younger than 300 Myr; one would surmise that a rapid onset
of convection in their outer photospheric layers puts an end to the pulsations.
Further observation and modeling of these stars is important for our
understanding of stellar evolution, the search for $g$-modes in the Sun, and is
even relevant to the interpretation of radial velocity variations of solar-type
stars (e.g. 51 Peg) in the search for extrasolar planets.

  with Central Density Cusps",,,"10.1086/118581",,"astro-ph",,"  We begin by presenting the analysis of a set of deep B- and V-band images of
the central density cusp of the globular cluster M30 (NGC 7099), taken with the
Faint Object Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. These images are the
first to resolve lower-mass main-sequence stars in the cluster's central 10''.
From the positions of individual stars, we measure an improved position for the
cluster center; this new position is 2.6'' from the previously known position.
We find no evidence of a ``flat'', constant-surface-density core; however, the
data do not rule out the presence of a core of radius up to 1.9'' (95%
confidence level). We measure a logarithmic cusp slope (d \log \sigma / d \log
r$) of -0.76 +- 0.07 (1-sigma) for stars with masses between 0.69 and 0.76
\Msun, and -0.82 +- 0.11 for stars with masses between 0.57 and 0.69 \Msun. We
also compare the overall mass function (MF) of the cluster cusp with the MF of
a field at r = 4.6' (near the cluster half-mass radius). The observed degree of
mass segregation is well matched by the predictions of an isotropic, multimass
King model. We then use the Jeans equation to compare the structure of M30 with
that of M15, another cusped cluster, using data from this and a previous paper.
We find that M30 is very close to achieving equipartition of energy between
stellar species, at least over the observed range in mass and radius, while M15
is not. This difference may be a result of the longer relaxation time in the
observed field in M15. The data also suggest that the degree of mass
segregation within the two cluster cusps is smaller than one would expect from
the measurements at larger radius. If so, this phenomenon might be the result
of gravothermal oscillations, of centrally-concentrated populations of
binaries, or of a ~10^3 \Msun black hole in one or more clusters.

13 new candidate members within 20 pc of the cluster centre have been
identified. Farther from the cluster centre there is a gradual merging between
certain cluster members and field stars, both spatially and kinematically.
Within the cluster, the kinematical structure is fully consistent with parallel
space motion of the component stars with an internal velocity dispersion of
about 0.3 km/s. The spatial structure and mass segregation are consistent with
N-body simulation results, without the need to invoke expansion, contraction,
rotation, or other significant perturbations of the cluster. The quality of the
individual distance determinations permits the cluster zero-age main sequence
to be accurately modelled. The helium abundance for the cluster is determined

convective overshooting, yields a cluster age of 625+/-50 Myr. The distance to

modulus m-M=3.33+/-0.01 mag for the objects within 10 pc of the cluster centre

dimerization dependence of the these quantities are obtained. The ground state
energy gain due to dimerization behaves as $u^a$ with $a > 2$ where $u$ denotes
the degree of dimerization, suggesting the absence of spin-Peierls instability.
It is explicitly shown that the string long range order survives even in the
presence of randomness. The string order behaves as $u^{2\beta}$ with $\beta
\sim 0.37$ in agreement with the recent prediction of real space
renormalization group theory ($\beta =(3-\sqrt{5})/2 \simeq 0.382$). The
physical picture of this behavior in this model is also discussed.

A simple scaling analysis as in self avoiding walk chains are not possible,
because three interplaying relevant length scales are involved, i.e., the Debye
screening length and the Pincus blob size. Therefore a selfconsistent
computation of an effective variational propagator is employed. It is shown
that the elastic force f is proportional to the end to end distance R for small
f. For larger forces we find a new regime, characterized by deformations larger
than a computed electrostatic ""blob size"". These results are supported by
simulations and intuitive physical arguments.

metallic, which leads to a multiband model. This assumption is supported by
band structure calculations. Taking a repulsive pairing interaction between
these doping bands and the CuO_{2} bands leads to opposite signs for the order
parameter on these bands and to nodes whenever the Fermi surfaces of these
bands cross. We show that in BSCCO the low temperature dependence of the
penetration depth is reasonably accounted for. In this case the nodes are not
located near the 45^{o} direction, which makes the experimental determination
of the node locations an important test for our model. The situation in HBCCO
and TBCCO is rather analogous to BSCCO. We consider the indications given by
NMR and find that they rather favor a metallic character for the doping bands.
Finally we discuss the cases of NCCO and LSCO which are not ''self-doped'' and
where our model does not give nodes.

a fermionic gauge theory with group $SU(2)\otimes U_S(1) \otimes U_{E}(1)$. In
the strong U_S(1) region, the SU(2) symmetry breaks down to a U(1), due to the
formation of a parity-invariant fermion condensate. We conjecture a phase
diagram for the theory involving a critical line, which separates the regions
of broken SU(2) symmetry from those where the symmetry is restored. In the
broken phase, the effective Abelian gauge theory is closely related to an
earlier model of two-dimensional parity-invariant superconductivity in doped
antiferromagnets. The superconductivity in the model occurs in the
Kosterlitz-Thouless mode, since strong phase fluctuations prevent the existence
of a local order parameter. Some physical consequences of the $SU(2) \times

In the $G_2$ holonomy case we present two types of $T$-duality transformation
which are clearly generalisations of the $T$-duality/mirror transformation in
Calabi-Yau spaces. The first maps Type IIA theory on one such space from this
class to Type IIB theory on another such space. The second maps Type IIA (IIB)

$T$-dual target spaces are related via the inclusion/exclusion of discrete
torsion and the $T$-duality is proven to genus $g$ in string perturbation
theory. We then apply a Strominger, Yau, Zaslow type argument which suggests
that manifolds of $G_2$ holonomy which have a ``mirror'' of the first (second)

solutions, which satisfy the unitarity and the crossing symmetry conditions --
natural conditions arising in physical applications. More specifically, we
consider ``linear'' solutions: the set $X$ is an abelian group, and the map $R$
is an automorphism of $X\times X$. We show that in this case, solutions are in
1-1 correspondence with pairs $a,b\in \End X$, such that $b$ is invertible and
$bab^{-1}=\frac{a}{a+1}$. Later we consider ``affine'' solutions ($R$ is an

they have a similar classification. The fact that these classifications are so
