  (1997)",,,"astro-ph",,"  Angular momentum transport in protostellar disks can be achieved by the
action of a large scale magnetic field that runs vertically through the disk.
The magnetic field centrifugally drives material from the disk surfaces into a
wind, initiating a bipolar outflow. One apparent difficulty for this model is
that the conductivity of the disk is extremely low in the inner 0.1--10 AU of
the disk, where grains are the dominant charge carriers. Near the midplane,
charged grains are unable to drift through the neutral gas and there is
negligible coupling between the magnetic field and the disk material. However,
the removal of angular momentum and acceleration of a wind by a magnetic field
can still take place in the surface layers of the disk where the gas
conductivity increases dramatically. Solutions to the multifluid MHD equations
for the vertical structure of a disk at a particular radius are presented. Most
of the disk material sits in hydrostatic equilibrium and does not interact with
the magnetic field running vertically through it. Near the disk surfaces, the
coupling between the magnetic field and disk material is sufficient to initiate
an outflow from the disk surface.

dynamical evolution of a neutron star with a mass slightly below the minimum
stable mass by means of a new implicit (general relativistic) hydrodynamic
code. We show that such a star first undergoes a phase of quasi-static
expansion, caused by slow nuclear $\beta$-decays, lasting for about 20 seconds,
but then explodes violently. The kinetic energy of the explosion is around
$10^{49} erg$, the peak luminosity in electron anti-neutrinos is of order
$10^{52} erg/s$, and the thermodynamic conditions of the expanding matter are
favorable for r-process nucleosynthesis. These results are obtained for the
Harrison-Wheeler equation of state and a simple and, possibly, unrealistic
treatment of $\beta$-decay rates and nuclear fission, which were adopted for
comparison with previous works. However, we do not expect that the outcome will
change qualitatively if more recent nuclear input physics used. Although our
study does not rely on a specific scenario ofhow a neutron star starting from a
bigger (and stable) masscan reach the dynamical phase, we assume that the final
mass-loss event happens on a very short time scale, i.e., on a time scale
shorter than a sound-crossing time, by removing a certain amount of mass as an
initial perturbation. This assumption implies that the star has no time to
adjust its nuclear composition to the new mass mass through a sequence of
quasi-equilibria. In the latter case, however, there exists no stable
configuration below the minimum mass, because the equation of state of fully
catalyzed matter is too soft. Therefore, the dynamics of the explosion will not
be too different from what have obtained if different initial perturbations are
assumed.

of high X-ray luminosity, distant clusters selected from the ROSAT All-Sky
Survey. The 10 clusters lie at z=0.22-0.28, an era where evolutionary effects
have been reported in the properties of cluster galaxy populations. Our
clusters thus provide a well-defined sample of the most massive systems at
these redshifts to quantify the extent and variability of these evolutionary
effects. Moreover, by concentrating on a narrow redshift range, we can take
advantage of the homogeneity of our sample to combine the catalogues from all
the clusters to analyse the bulk properties of their populations. The core
regions of these clusters ontain only a small proportion of star-forming
galaxies, and they therefore do not exhibit a `Butcher-Oemler' effect. Focusing
on the redder cluster galaxies we find that their integrated luminosity is well
correlated with the cluster X-ray temperatures, and hence with cluster mass.
Furthermore, the typical UV-optical colours of the elliptical sequences in the
clusters exhibit a small cluster-to-cluster scatter, <=2%, indicating that
these galaxies are highly homogeneous between clusters. However, at fainter
magnitudes we observe an increase in the range of mid-UV colours of galaxies
possessing strong 4000A breaks. In the light of the apparent decline in the S0
populations of z>=0.4 clusters (Dressler et al. 1997), and in view of the
luminosities and colours of this population, we propose that they may be the
progenitors of the S0 population of local rich clusters, caught in the final
stage before they become completely quiescent. [abridged]

bifurcation leading to limit cycle solutions with respect to physically
relevant drive parameters. Here we use reductive perturbative method to extract
an amplitude equation of up to seventh order to obtain an approximate analytic
expression for the order parameter. The analysis also enables us to obtain the
bifurcation (phase) diagram of the instability. We find that while
supercritical bifurcation dominates the major part of the instability region,
subcritical bifurcation gradually takes over at one end of the region. These
results are compared with the known experimental results. Approximate analytic
expressions for the limit cycles for different types of bifurcations are shown
to agree with their corresponding numerical solutions of the equations

interpretation, this mapping amounts to a reflection that interchanges the
longitudinal direction with one of the transverse directions.

  Boxedeps.tex macro",,,"FAU-TP3-97/5","hep-th",,"  We investigate consequences of the effective colour-dielectric formulation of
lattice gauge theory using the light-cone Hamiltonian formalism with a
transverse lattice (hep-ph/9704408). As a quantitative test of this approach,
we have performed extensive analytic and numerical calculations for
2+1-dimensional pure gauge theory in the large $N$ limit. We study the
structure of coupling constant space for our effective potential by comparing
with results available from conventional Euclidean lattice Monte Carlo
simulations of this system. In particular, we calculate and measure the scaling
behaviour of the entire low-lying glueball spectrum, glueball wavefunctions,
string tension, asymptotic density of states, and deconfining temperature.

generalized Rouse equation for a test chain in a matrix which can undergo the
glass transition. It is shown that the surrounding matrix renormalizes the
static properties of the test chain. Furthermore the freezing of the different
Rouse modes is investigated. This yields freezing temperatures which depend
from the Rouse mode index.

principle: local time reversal. It immediately leads to a simple
characterization of separable quantum states that reproduces results known to
hold for binary composite systems and which thereby is complete for low
dimensions. We then describe a constructive algorithm for finding the canonical
decomposition of separable and non separable mixed states of dimensions 2x2 and
2x3.
