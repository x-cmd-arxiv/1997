discontinuity at 912 Angstroms. The UV luminosity of the typical z = 3 galaxy
exceeds by more than one order of magnitude that of the most luminous
starbursts in the nearby universe, although the maximum star formation
intensity (SFR per unit area) is within the limits found in local surveys. We
consider in detail the likely magnitude of dust extinction and conclude that
published estimates of the volume-averaged star formation rate at high z need
to be revised to higher values by a factor of about 3. This correction improves
the agreement between the observations and recent theoretical predictions.
Lyman alpha emission is generally weak, most likely as a result of resonant
scattering. The large equivalent widths of the strongest interstellar lines and
their systematic blueshift (by up to several hundred km/s) relative to the
Lyman alpha emission line are indicative of highly energetic outflows in the
interstellar medium. Pilot observations have detected the redshifted Hbeta and
[O III] emission lines in the K band. The widths of these features imply
dynamical masses of approximately 10^{10} solar masses for the innermost star
forming regions; the total masses involved are likely to exceed 10^{12} solar
masses.

soft-excess is well described by optically thick, low temperature, thermal
Comptonization which may dominate the entire big blue bump. This might explain
the observed tight UV/soft X-ray variability correlation and absence of a Lyman
edge in this object. However, the plasma parameters inferred by the spectrum
need stratification in optical depth and/or temperature to prevent physical
inconsistency. The optical/UV/soft X-ray component contributes about half of
the total source flux. The spectral variations of the soft-excess are
consistent with that of the UV and argue that the components are closely
related. The overall pattern of spectral variability suggests variations of the
source geometry, and shows the optical/UV/soft X-ray component to be harder

considered as rigid constraints and through the lens (ray-trace) equation they
provide us with linear constraint equations. These constraints confine the mass
distribution to some allowed region, which is then found by linear programming.
Within this allowed region we study in detail the mass distribution with
minimum mass-to-light variation; also some others, such as the smoothest mass
distribution. The method is applied to the extensively studied cluster Abell
370, which hosts a giant luminous arc and several other multiply imaged
background galaxies. Our mass maps are constrained by the observed positions
and redshifts (spectroscopic or model-inferred by previous authors) of the
giant arc and multiple image systems. The reconstructed maps obtained for \a370
reveal a detailed mass distribution, with substructure quite different from the
light distribution. The method predicts the bimodal nature of the cluster and
that the projected mass distribution is indeed elongated along the axis defined
by the two dominant cD galaxies. But the peaks in the mass distribution appear
to be offset from the centres of the cDs. We also present an estimate for the
total mass of the central region of the cluster. This is in good agreement with

limited sample of galaxies using the MEFOS multifibre spectrograph at the ESO
3.6m telescope. With the new data set radial velocities for 120 centrally
located cluster members become available which is equivalent to 78% of all

been measured, rising the total number to 48. We investigate the prominent
bimodal velocity distribution of Centaurus in more detail, discussing the very
different characteristics of the velocity distributions for the main Hubble
types E&S0, spirals, Im&BCD, and dE&dS0. The nucleated, bright dwarf
ellipticals are the only galaxies with a Gaussian-like distribution centred at
3148+/-98 km/s. The remarkable coincidence of this velocity with the mean
velocity of Cen30 and the redshift of NGC 4696 in particular strongly suggests
a connection of the dE&dS0s to the gravitational centre of the Centaurus
cluster and/or to the cluster dominant E galaxy. The application of statistical
tests reveals the existence of a population dwarf galaxies bound to NGC 4696.
The dynamical parameters for the two velocity components suggest that Cen30 is
the real Centaurus cluster whereas Cen45 can only be a loosely bound group of
galaxies. This conclusion is followed up with a type-mixture analysis. All
results are fully consistent with the cluster-group scenario. Whether Cen45 is
merging with the cluster or is located in the close background remains unclear.
We show that the poorness of Cen45 represents an intrinsic problem which makes

Burst Monitor (GRBM) and Wide Field Cameras (WFC) of GB960720. We derive a
precise localization (3 arcmin radius) and fast broad band (2-700 keV) spectral
evolution of the event. A search in the catalogues at all wavelengths in the
error box yields a unique outstanding source: the bright radio quasar 4C 49.29.
Although the probability of finding such a source by chance is very low
(0.0002), the absence of similar counterparts in other small error boxes
suggests a chance occurrence. We also find that the duration-energy
relationship for bursts previously observed above 25keV (Fenimore et al. 1995)
extends down to 1.5 keV. This result suggests that the same radiation mechanism
is operating from X-rays to gamma-rays and is in agreement with radiative
cooling by synchotron emission. A fast evolution of the spectrum is found, in
which the ratio of X- to gamma-ray intensities varies over three orders of
magnitude. Furthermore, the spectrum in the initial phase of the event betrays
the presence of an optically thick source rapidly evolving in a thin
configuration.No other class of sources in the universe shows such a fast and
extreme evolution. These results pose new and tighter constraints on
theoretical models for gamma-ray bursts.

presence of large amounts of cold molecular hydrogen in the outer parts of disk
galaxies, an hypothesis that we have recently developed. Direct ways range from
H2 absorption in the UV domain to detection of the radio hyperfine structure:
the ortho-H2 molecule has an hyperfine, or ultrafine, structure in its
fundamental state, due to the coupling between the rotation-induced magnetic
moment, and the nuclear spin. This gives rise to 2 magnetic dipole transitions,
at the wavelengths of 0.5 and 5.5 km. Indirect ways are essentially the
detection of the HD and LiH transitions, and in some environments like clusters
of galaxies, more heavy trace molecules such as CO. We discuss from this point
of view the recent discovery by COBE/FIRAS of a very cold Galactic dust
component (4-7 K) which could correspond to a dominating gas mass component of
the ISM, if interpreted as standard dust emission. Some of the proposed means
could be applied to the well-known molecular clouds, to bring some new light to

contrast with most earlier theoretical work, the present study investigates
different initial value problems of a warped disk in an oblate (or prolate)
halo potential, and it represents the disk warp in terms of $N$ independently
tilted, self-gravitating, concentric rings. This representation gives new
insight into the disk warping. A new constant of the motion of $N$ tilted rings
is identified (in addition to the energy). The phenomenon of phase-locking of
the lines-of-nodes of nearby rings due to self-gravity is demonstrated. We
consider the influence of dynamical friction due to ring motion through the
halo matter as well as friction between gaseous rings with different vertical
motions due to turbulent viscosity. We first consider the dynamics of one, two,

develop dynamical equations for $N-$rings which are most simply expressed in
terms of the complex tilt angles $\Theta_j = \theta_j exp(-i\phi_j)$, where
$\theta_j$ is the actual tilt angle and $\phi_j$ the line-of-nodes angle for
the $j^{th}$ ring ($j=1..N$). We numerically solve the equations for $\Theta_j$

accuracy in the determination of the renormalization of two-fermion lattice
operators. We concentrate on three finite quantities which are particularly
suitable for our study: the renormalization constants of the vector and axial
currents and the ratio of the renormalization constants of the scalar and
pseudoscalar densities. We calculate these quantities in boosted perturbation
theory, with several running boosted couplings, at the ""optimal"" scale q*. We
find that the results of boosted perturbation theory are usually (but not
always) in better agreement with non-perturbative determinations of the
renormalization constants than those obtained with standard perturbation
theory. The finite renormalization constants of two-fermion lattice operators
are also obtained non-perturbatively, using Ward Identities, both with the
Wilson and the tree-level Clover improved actions, at fixed cutoff ($\beta$=6.4
and 6.0 respectively). In order to amplify finite cutoff effects, the quark
masses (in lattice units) are varied in a large interval 0<am<1. We find that
discretization effects are always large with the Wilson action, despite our
relatively small value of the lattice spacing ($a^{-1} \simeq 3.7$ GeV). With
the Clover action discretization errors are significantly reduced at small
quark mass, even though our lattice spacing is larger ($a^{-1} \simeq 2$ GeV).
However, these errors remain substantial in the heavy quark region. We have
implemented a proposal for reducing O(am) effects, which consists in matching
the lattice quantities to their continuum counterparts in the free theory. We
find that this approach still leaves appreciable, mass dependent,
discretization effects.

the total cross section. We also calculate the tree diagrams for color-octet
production at order $\alpha^2_s$ in a region of phase space where there is no
leading color-octet contribution. We find that in this regime the color-singlet
contribution dominates. We argue that non-perturbative corrections arising from
diffractive leptoproduction, higher twist effects, and higher order terms in
the NRQCD velocity expansion should be suppressed as $Q^2$ is increased.
Therefore, the color-octet matrix elements $< {\cal O}_8^{\psi}(^1S_0)>$ and
$<{\cal O}_8^{\psi}(^3P_0)>$ can be reliably extracted from this process.
Finally, we point out that an experimental measurement of the polarization of

that the solitons of our dual theories also agree with their heterotic

examine the non-perturbative stability of these strings, and we propose a phase

point is the usual expression for the one-loop correction to the mass of a

authors put the system in a box with suitable boundary conditions, and impose
an ultraviolet cut-off. We distinguish between an energy cut-off and a mode
number cut-off, and show that they lead to different results. We claim that
only the mode cut-off yields correct results, and only if one considers exactly
the same number of bosonic and fermionic modes in the total sum over
bound-state and zero-point energies. To substantiate this claim, we show that
in the sine-Gordon model only the mode cut-off yields a result for the quantum
soliton mass that is consistent with the exact result for the spectrum as
obtained by Dashen et al. from quantising the so-called breather solution. In
the supersymmetric case, our conclusion is that contrary to previous claims the

amplitude in the description of the processes $pp \to pp\pi^0$ and $pp\to
d\pi^+$ at threshold. We argue that the presently used tree level dimension two
approximation used in chiral perturbation theory is insufficient as input by
direct comparison with the $\pi$N scattering data. We also show that a
successful semi--phenomenological boson--exchange model does better in the
description of these data. The influence of the violation of crossing symmetry
in the meson--exchange model has to be studied in more detail. We stress that
further investigations of the process $pp\to d\pi^+$ can pave the way to a
deeper understanding of the pion dominated part of the transition operator.

$q$-deformed $su(2)$ algebras are discussed. In particular, we exhibit the
similarity of the $q$-deformed $su(2)$ algebra obtained from $q$-oscillators
via Schwinger construction and those obtained from $q$-Holstein-Primakoff
transformation and show how the relation between $su_{\sqrt{q}}(2)$ and Hong
Yan $q$-oscillator can be regarded as an special case of In\""{o}u\""{e}- Wigner
contraction. This latter observation and the imposition of positive norm
requirement suggest that Hong-Yan $q$-oscillator algebra is different from the
usual $su_{\sqrt{q}}(2)$ algebra, contrary to current belief in the literature.

using a master equation based on quantum kinetic theory, which can be well
approximated by a description using only the condensate mode in interaction
with a thermalized bath of noncondensate atoms. A rate equation of the form n =
2W(n)[(1-exp((mu_n - mu)/kT))n + 1] is derived, in which the difference between
the condensate chemical potential mu_n and the bath chemical potential mu gives
the essential behavior. Solutions of this equation, in conjunction with the
theoretical description of the process of evaporative cooling, give a
characteristic latency period for condensate formation and appear to be
consistent with the observed behavior of both rubidium and sodium condensate
formation.
