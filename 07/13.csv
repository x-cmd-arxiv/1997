  Presented at the 1997 7th International Origins Conference, Estes Park, CO",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I review some recent progress made in our understanding of galaxy evolution
and the cosmic history of star formation. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) imaging
survey has achieved the sensitivity to capture the bulk of the extragalactic
background light from discrete sources. No evidence is found in the optical
number-magnitude relation down to AB=29 mag for a large amount of star
formation at high redshifts. The emission history of the universe at
ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelengths can be modeled from the
present epoch to z~4 by tracing the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy
luminosity density, as determined from several deep spectroscopic samples and
the HDF. The global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies are well
fitted by a simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent star
formation rate (SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal initial mass
function which is relatively rich in massive stars. The SFR density is found to
rise sharply, by about an order of magnitude, from a redshift of zero to a peak
value at z~1.5, to fall again by a factor of 2 (4) out of a redshift of 3 (4).
Since only 10% of the current stellar content of galaxies is produced at z>2.5,
a rather low cosmic metallicity is predicted at these early times, in good
agreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped Lyman-\alpha
systems. The biggest uncertainty is represented by the poorly constrained
amount of starlight that was absorbed by dust and reradiated in the IR at early
epochs.

direction of the globular cluster M55 to study the dynamical interaction of
this cluster with the tidal fields of the Galaxy. An entire quadrant of the
cluster has been covered, out to ~2.0 times the tidal radius. A CMD down to
about 4 magnitudes below the turn-off is presented and analysed. A large
population of BS has been identified. The BS are significantly more
concentrated in the inner 300 arcsec, while they become less concentrated in
the cluster envelope. We have obtained luminosity functions at various radial
intervals from the center and their corresponding mass functions. Both clearly
show the presence of mass segregation inside the cluster. A dynamical analysis
shows that the observed mass segregation is compatible with what is predicted
by multi-mass King-Michie models. The global mass function is very flat with a
power-law slope of x=-1.0+/-0.4. This suggest that M55 might have suffered
selective losses of stars, caused by tidal interactions with the Galactic disk
and bulge. The radial density profile of M55 out to ~2.0 r_t suggests the
presence of extra-tidal stars whose nature could be connected with the cluster.

the COBE normalized matter power spectrum for these models. We find that it is
possible to construct models consistent with observations for masses $m_\nu >
50 eV by adjusting t_d so as to keep the quantity (m_\nu(keV))^2 t_d(yr)
constant at a value around 100. For m_\nu < 1 keV the power spectrum has extra
power at small scales which could result in an early epoch of galaxy formation.
We do not find any value of t_d which gives a viable model in the mass range
m_\nu < 50 eV. We also consider the implications of radiatively decaying
neutrinos---models in which a small fraction B << 1 of neutrinos decay into
photons-which could possibly ionize the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high
redshift. We show that the parameter space of decaying particles which
satisfies the IGM observations does not give viable models of structure
formation.

Abell/ACO clusters (XBACs) and compare it to the optical Abell/ACO cluster
dipole. The X-ray cluster dipole is well aligned ($\le 25^{\circ}$) with the
CMB dipole, while it follows closely the radial profile of its optical cluster
counterpart although its amplitude is $\sim 10 - 30$ per cent lower. In view of
the fact that the the XBACs sample is not affected by the volume incompleteness
and the projection effects that are known to exist at some level in the optical
parent Abell/ACO cluster catalogue, our present results confirm the previous
optical cluster dipole analysis that there are significant contributions to the
Local Group motion from large distances ($\sim 160h^{-1} $Mpc). In order to
assess the expected contribution to the X-ray cluster dipole from a purely
X-ray selected sample we compare the dipoles of the XBACs and the Brightest
Cluster Sample (Ebeling et al. 1997a) in their overlap region. The resulting
dipoles are in mutual good aggreement with an indication that the XBACs sample
slightly underestimates the full X-ray dipole (by $\le 5$ per cent) while the
Virgo cluster contributes about 10 - 15 per cent to the overall X-ray cluster
dipole. Using linear perturbation theory to relate the X-ray cluster dipole to
the Local group peculiar velocity we estimate the density parameter to be
$\beta_{c_{x}} \simeq 0.24 \pm 0.05$.

through a quantum dot is investigated numerically for the Coulomb blockade
regime. For vanishing magnetic fields, the conductance peak height statistics
is found to be independent of the interactions strength. It is identical to the
statistics predicted by constant interaction single electron random matrix
theory and agrees well with recent experiments. However, in contrast to these
random matrix theories, our calculations reproduces the reduced sensitivity to
magnetic flux observed in many experiments. The relevant physics is traced to
the short range Coulomb correlations providing thus a unified explanation for
the transmission statistics as well as for the large conductance peak spacing
fluctuations observed in other experiments.

consequence of QCD sum rules. This conclusion is also supported by a direct QCD

driven, periodically collapsing bubbles of air in water (sonoluminescence) has
yet to receive an adequate explanation. One of the most intriguing ideas is
that the conversion of acoustic energy into photons occurs quantum
mechanically, through a dynamical version of the Casimir effect. We have argued
elsewhere that in the adiabatic approximation, which should be reliable here,
Casimir or zero-point energies cannot possibly be large enough to be relevant.
(About 10 MeV of energy is released per collapse.) However, there are
sufficient subtleties involved that others have come to opposite conclusions.
In particular, it has been suggested that bulk energy, that is, simply the
naive sum of ${1\over2}\hbar\omega$, which is proportional to the volume, could
be relevant. We show that this cannot be the case, based on general principles
as well as specific calculations. In the process we further illuminate some of
the divergence difficulties that plague Casimir calculations, with an example
relevant to the bag model of hadrons.
