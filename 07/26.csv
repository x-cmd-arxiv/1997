120 kpc. This is indicated by the distinctively bi-conical morphology of 3C34's

of `shadowing' outward from the central ionizing source. A simple
photoionization model is used to show that this interpretation is energetically
viable on these length scales. The luminosity of the hidden central AGN,
necessary to account for the observed [OII] luminosity, is compatible with that
of a typical 3CR quasar at a similar redshift. Although this interpretation can
account for the excitation and most of the unique shape of the warm gas, it is
insufficient to explain the velocity and line-width structures observed with
our Fabry-Perot interferometer. Therefore, we also propose that the illuminated
medium surrounding 3C34 is the result of gas swept aside by the lateral
expansion and backflow of the radio source lobes.

  ApJ",,"10.1086/304898",,"astro-ph",,"  We propose that the intensity changes and spectral evolution along the M87
jet can be explained by adiabatic changes to the particle momentum distribution
function and the magnetic field. This is supported by the lack of any
significant variation in the radio-to-optical spectral index along the jet and
the moderate changes in radio brightness. Assuming a simple scaling law between
magnetic field and density, we use the deprojection of a 2 cm VLA intensity map
by Sparks, Biretta, & Macchetto (1996) to predict the spectral evolution along
the jet. We derive limits for the magnetic field and the total pressure by
comparing our results with the spatially resolved fit to spectral data by
Neumann, Meisenheimer, & Roeser (1997) of a model spectrum that cuts off at
approx 10^15 Hz. To explain the weakness of synchrotron cooling along the jet,
the magnetic field strength must lie below the equipartition value. Although
the inferred pressure in the limit of nonrelativistic bulk flow lies far above
the estimated pressure of the interstellar matter in the center of M87, bulk
Lorentz factors Gamma_jet in the range of 3 - 5 and inclination angles approx
less than 25 deg lead to pressure estimates close to the ISM pressure. The
average best fit magnetic fields we derive fall in the range of 20 - 40 microG,
departing from equipartition by a factor approx 1.5 - 5. This model is
consistent with the proposal by Bicknell & Begelman (1996) that the knots in
the M87 jet are weak, oblique shocks. First-order Fermi acceleration will then
have a minimal effect on the slope of the radio-- to-optical spectrum while
possibly accounting for the X-ray spectrum.

General relativistic cosmology is summarized, and the data on the basic
cosmological parameters ($t_o$ and $H_0 \equiv 100 h \kmsmpc$, $\Omega_0$,
$\Omega_\Lambda$ and $\Omega_b$) are reviewed. Various particle physics
candidates for hot, warm, and cold dark matter are briefly reviewed, together
with current constraints and experiments that could detect or eliminate them.
Also included is a very brief summary of the theory of cosmic defects, and a
somewhat more extended exposition of the idea of cosmological inflation with a
summary of some current models of inflation. The remainder is a discussion of
observational constraints on cosmological model building, emphasizing models in
which most of the dark matter is cold and the primordial fluctuations are the
sort predicted by inflation. It is argued that the simplest models that have a
hope of working are Cold Dark Matter with a cosmological constant
($\Lambda$CDM) if the Hubble parameter is high ($h \gsim 0.7$), and Cold + Hot
Dark Matter (CHDM) if the Hubble parameter and age permit an $\Omega=1$
cosmology, as seems plausible in light of the data from the Hipparcos
astrometric satellite. The most attractive variants of these models and the
critical tests for each are discussed.

the H-alpha emission from the WIM contributes about 40% of the total observed
H-alpha luminosity from spirals. This places severe constraints on possible
sources of ionization, since only photo ionization by OB stars meets this

the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation residuals can be used to estimate the relative
mass contributions of the stellar disk and the dark halo at the peak of the
disk rotation, near 2.2 exponential scale lengths (Rh). For ""maximal disks"", a
large fraction (0.85 +/- 0.10) of the total rotational support, V2.2, at such
radii should arise from their stellar mass. We find that the disk size, or
surface brightness, is not a significant additional parameter in the TF
relation and the case of a maximal disk is ruled out for most HSB galaxies. We
model adiabatic infall of varying amounts of luminous matter into dark matter
halos and find that the TF relation residuals require a mean value of
V2.2/Vtotal ~ 0.6 +/- 0.1, fairly insensitive to the details of the initial
dark matter halo and to the presence of a bulge. This translates to
Mhalo/Mtotal ~ 0.6 within 2.2*Rh, or roughly twice more dark matter in the
inner parts of late-type spirals than previously accounted for by maximum disk
fits. We show that any stellar population differences between disks of
different scalelengths lead to lower values of V2.2/Vtotal. Our result is
independent of the shape of the luminosity profile and relies only on the
assumption of adiabatic contraction and that the dark matter halo rotation
rises in the central parts of the galaxy. Sub-maximal disks establish a natural
continuity between HSB and low-surface brightness (LSB) galaxies which appear
to be completely dark matter dominated even in their inner regions. (Abridged)

are chaotic, derives from their abundance in nature. The spectrum of such
systems can be related, in the semiclassical approximation (SCA), to the
unstable classical periodic orbits, through Gutzwiller's trace formula. The
class of systems studied in this work, tiling billiards on the pseudo-sphere,
is special in this correspondence being exact, via Selberg's trace formula. In
this work, an exact expression for Green's function (GF) and the eigenfunctions
(EF) of tiling billiards on the pseudo-sphere, whose classical dynamics are
chaotic, is derived. GF is shown to be equal to the quotient of two infinite
sums over periodic orbits, where the denominator is the spectral determinant.
Such a result is known to be true for typical chaotic systems, in the leading
SCA. From the exact expression for GF, individual EF can be identified. In
order to obtain a SCA by finite series for the infinite sums encountered,
resummation by analytic continuation in $\hbar$ was performed. The result is
similar to known results for EF of typical chaotic systems. The lowest EF of
the Hamiltonian were calculated with the help of the resulting formulae, and
compared with exact numerical results. A search for scars with the help of
analytical and numerical methods failed to find evidence for their existence.

end we have repeated the calculation of the initial conditions confirming the
final results of Adel and Yao and Greub and Hurth and generalizing them to
include the dependences on $\mu_t$ and $\mu_W$ with $\mu_t\not=\mu_W$. In the
leading order the $\mu_W$ and $\mu_t$ uncertainties in $Br(B\to X_s\gamma)$
turn out to be $\pm 13%$ and $\pm 3%$ respectively. We show analytically how
these uncertainties are reduced after including next-to-leading QCD
corrections. They amount to $\pm 1.1%$ and $\pm 0.4%$ respectively. Reanalyzing
the uncertainties due to the scale $\mu_b=\ord(m_b)$ we find that after the
inclusion of NLO effects they amount to $\pm 4.3%$ which is a factor 2/3
smaller than claimed in the literature. Including the uncertainties due to
input parameters as well as the non-perturbative $1/m_b^2$ and $1/m_c^2$
