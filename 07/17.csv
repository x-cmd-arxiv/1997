extragalactic measurement of the atomic deuterium to hydrogen ratio, D/H. We
have obtained a new low-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Keck
spectrum to re-measure the total neutral hydrogen column density N(H I) using
the amount of Lyman continuum absorption. We develop a new method to directly
determine the intrinsic unabsorbed quasar continuum from low-resolution spectra
of the \Lya forest for the first time. We use three types of spectra to measure
N(H I): (1) A wide slit spectrum for flux calibration, (2) a high-resolution
spectrum to determine the unabsorbed continuum between \Lya forest lines, and
(3) a high SNR spectrum to measure the residual flux below the Lyman limit. We
measure Log [N(H I)] = 17.86 $\pm$ 0.02 \cm2, which is reliable because N(H I)
is fully specified by the data. This result is consistent with the N(H I)
measured by Tytler, Fan & Burles (1996) from the Lyman series absorption lines,
but not with absorption models proposed by Wampler (1996) nor estimates of the
total N(H I) by Songaila et al. (1997), both of which suggested lower N(H I)
and higher D/H. The Wampler models predict abundant flux below the Lyman limit
which is absent from both our old and new spectra, taken with different
instruments. The new Keck data is consistent with the data presented by
Songaila et al. (1997). The results differ due to the different methods of
analysis, and our measurement of the QSO continuum does not agree with the
continuum models assumed by Songaila et al. (1997).

production. Both the magnitude and morphology of the response depend on the

for secondary infall in a small group environment. Tidal stripping reduces the
mass of the infalling galaxies, thereby increasing the timescale for their
orbital decay. There is little evidence that these high velocity ``intruders''

mechanism that sustains compact groups against collapse. Efficient gas
stripping may account for the low star formation rate observed in compact
groups and infall of residual gas into galactic nuclei may also foster the

intrinic part of self gravity. Applied to dark matter halos of disk galaxies,
particle numbers of at least 10^6 will be necessary to suppress this noise at a

exponents $\zeta_n$ of the $n$th order correlators in fully developed
hydrodynamic turbulence. The scheme is nonperturbative and constructed to
respect the fundamental rescaling symmetry of the Euler equation. It
constitutes an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations that are obeyed
identically with respect to scaling for any set of $\zeta_n$. As a consequence
$\zeta_n$ are determined by solvability conditions and not from power counting.
It is arguedthat in order to achieve such a formulation one must recognize that
the many-point space-time correlators are not scale invariant in time
arguments. The assumption of full scale invariance leads unavoidably to K41
exponents. It is argued the determination of of $\zeta_n$ requires equations
for infinitely many renormalized objects. One ca n however proceed in
controlled successive approximations by truncations of the infinite hierarchy
of equations. Clues as to how to truncate without reintroducing power counting
can be obtained from renormalized perturbation theory. To this aim we show that
the fully resummed perturbation theory is equivalent in its contents to the
exact hierarchy of equations obeyed by the $n$th order correlators and Green's
function. In light of this important result we can safely use finite
resummations to construct successive closures. This paper presents the
conceptual and technical details of the scheme. The analysis of the high-order
closure procedures which do not destroy the rescaling symmetry and the actual
calculations for truncated models will be presented in a forthcoming paper in
collaboration with V. Belinicher.

high pressure crystalline form occurs at 9 GPa and is reversible upon
decompression, whereas the second transition occurs at higher pressures and is
irreversible. In GaAsO4, EXAFS measurements agree with the predicted transition
from four- to six-fold coordination of oxygen atoms around the cations, but the
two local coordination transformations are not dissociated; in fact, both As
and Ga atoms exhibit a coordination change at the onset of the first phase
transition, the rate of transformation being significantly higher for Ga atoms.
In both cases, the average bond length increases very rapidly with pressure
thus yielding the first compression stage after the transition. In the second
stage, the average bond lengths increase slowly, ultimately reaching six-fold
coordination above 28 GPa and 24 GPa for As and Ga respectively. The behaviour
of the As K-edge EXAFS is the same for both compounds, and enables us to link
the behaviour of Ga and Al atoms. The local transformations are well described
and a direct link with phosphate berlinites seems timely.

from a dimensional reduction of ten dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ super
Yang-Mills, which is a matrix model candidate for non-perturbative Type IIA

We adopt light-cone coordinates to parametrize the string world sheet, and
choose to work in the light-cone gauge. Quantizing this theory via Discretized
Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the
light-cone momentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of
1/K. We show how a double scaling limit involving the integers $K$ and $N$
implies the existence of an extra (free) parameter in the Yang-Mills theory,
which plays the role of an effective string coupling constant. The formulation
here provides a natural framework for studying quantitatively string dynamics
and conventional Yang-Mills in a unified setting.

We find that the neutron excess increases the fragmentation of the isovector

energies beyond the mass dependence predicted by the collective models. The
radial separation of proton and neutron densities associated with a large
neutron excess leads to non vanishing isoscalar transition densities to the GDR
states, which are therefore predicted to be excited also by isoscalar nuclear
probes. The evolution of the isoscalar compression dipole mode as a function of
the neutron excess is finally studied. We find that the large neutron excess
leads to a strong concentration of the strength associated with the isoscalar
dipole operator $\sum_ir^3_iY_{10}$, that mainly originates from uncorrelated
excitations of the neutrons of the skin.
