10^4-10^5 yr. Using a simple spherical model of a cocoon/shock system, it is
found that inactive sources fade rapidly in radio luminosity but the shock in
the ambient medium continues to expand supersonically, thereby keeping the
whole source structure intact during the inactive phases. The fading of
inactive sources, and the effect of the intermittency on the expansion
velocity, can readily explain the observed over-abundance of small radio
sources. In particular, the plateau in the observed distribution of sizes found
by O'Dea & Baum (1997) can be interpreted as being due to intermittency. The
model predicts that very young sources will be particularly radio luminous,
once the effects of absorption have been accounted for. Furthermore, it
predicts the existence of a significant number of faint `coasting' sources.
These might be detectable in deep, low-frequency radio maps, or via the X-ray
and optical emission line properties of the shock front.

resonant cyclotron scattering in a radiation-driven outflow. Most previous
models of line formation in gamma-ray bursts are appropriate at the polar cap
of a neutron star located no further than several hundred parsecs away.
However, the BATSE brightness and sky distributions indicate that, if bursters
are galactic, they are located in a corona at distances greater than 100 kpc.
At these distances the burst luminosity exceeds the Eddington luminosity and
the plasma in a polar line-forming region is ejected along the field lines. The
variation of the magnetic field strength and plasma velocity with altitude in
such an outflow would seem to prevent the formation of narrow features like
those observed by Ginga and other instruments. However, this is not the case
because the majority of scatters occur close to the stellar surface, at
altitudes below $z \approx r_h$, where $r_h \sim 10^{5}$ cm is the size of the
photon source. Consequently, the interpretation of the observed features as
cyclotron lines does not rule out burst sources in a galactic corona. The
outflow model predicts both absorption-like and single-peaked emission-like
features. The latter do not occur in models with static line-forming regions,
but have been observed in gamma-ray bursts by the Konus and BATSE instruments.

  satisfies the 24-line limit",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Suppose two distant observers Alice and Bob share a pure bipartite quantum
state. By applying local operations and communicating with each other using a
classical channel, Alice and Bob can manipulate it into some other states.
Previous investigations of entanglement manipulations have been largely limited
to a small number of strategies and their average outcomes. Here we consider a
general entanglement manipulation strategy and go beyond the average property.
For a pure entangled state shared between two separated persons Alice and Bob,
we show that the mathematical interchange symmetry of the Schmidt decomposition
can be promoted into a physical symmetry between the actions of Alice and Bob.
Consequently, the most general (multi-step two-way-communications) strategy of
entanglement manipulation of a pure state is, in fact, equivalent to a strategy
involving only a single (generalized) measurement by Alice followed by one-way
communications of its result to Bob. We also prove that strategies with one-way
communications are generally more powerful than those without communications.
In summary, one-way communications is necessary and sufficient for the
entanglement manipulations of a pure bipartite state. The supremum probability
of obtaining a maximally entangled state (of any dimension) from an arbitrary
state is determined and a strategy for achieving this probability is
constructed explicitly. One important question is whether collective
manipulations in quantum mechanics can greatly enhance the probability of large
deviations from the average behavior. We answer this question in the negative
for a specific problem.
