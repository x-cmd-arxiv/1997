spherical models with a phase-space distribution function of the
Osipkov-Merritt type. The velocity distribution in these models is isotropic
near the center and becomes radially anisotropic at large radii. They are
special members of the family studied by Dehnen and Tremaine et al. where the
mass density has a power-law cusp $\rho\propto r^{-\gamma}$ at small radii and
decays as $\rho\propto r^{-4}$ at large radii. The radial-orbit instability of
models with $\gamma$ = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2, was studied using an N-body code
written by one of us and based on the `self-consistent field' method developed
by Hernquist and Ostriker. These simulations have allowed us to delineate a
boundary in the $(\gamma,r_{a})$-plane that separates the stable from the
unstable models. This boundary is given by $2T_{r}/T_{t} = 2.31 \pm 0.27$, for
the ratio of the total radial to tangential kinetic energy. We also found that
the stability criterion $df/dQ\le 0$, recently raised by Hjorth, gives lower
values compared with our numerical results.

include spatial and/or temporal variations in the temperature in the solar core

differences seen at maximum persist, and actually increase with time,
einforcing the notion that intrinsic differences do exist among SNe Ia. Since
such differences are not accounted for in the standard progenitor scenario, it
becomes important to derive constraints for the models directly from the
observations. In order to investigate the influence of the two most important
parameters, that is the masses of the synthesized radioactive material and of
the ejecta, a simple MC light curve model was used to simulate the luminosity
evolution from the explosion to very late epochs (~1000 days). It was found
that the observations require a range of a factor 10 in the masses of the
radioactive material synthesized in the explosion (Mni= 0.1-1.1 Msun,) and a
factor 2 in the total mass of the ejecta (Mej = 0.7-1.4 Msun). Differences of a
factor 2 in Mni seem to be present even among `normal' SNe Ia. Some evidence
was also found that the deposition of the positrons from Co decay varies from

redshift data in order to identify galaxies dynamically belonging to the main
body of the cluster and/or to superimposed substructures. Various kinds of
emission are superimposed on a mean thermal X-ray emission due to the
intra-cluster gas: a) an X-ray flux excess in the centre; b) a south blob,
partially generated by individual galaxies. The mean velocity and velocity
dispersion of the galaxies located in this region are the same as those of the
cluster as a whole: it therefore does not seem to be a bound subgroup; c) West
emission due to a foreground group with self-emission from a Seyfert galaxy
located at the north-west; d) emission in the south-west due to inverse Compton
emission associated to a very steep radio source (the remnant of an active
galactic nucleus). We have examined the possibility for the central peak to be
an ""unusual"" galaxy, as assumed for the central galaxy of J2310-43 (Tananbaum
et al. 1997). We conclude on the existence of a cooling flow region, in which
the presence of at least three small features certainly related to cooler blobs
is revealed by the wavelet analysis. We have performed a pixel-to-pixel
modelling of the double X-ray emission. The large scale emission component is
comparable to those derived from by the PSPC data and the small scale one is

small angular scales, while coronographs have been used to study high contrast
sources. We propose launching the Improved Resolution and Image Selection
(IRIS) Satellite, a large steerable occulting satellite. IRIS will have several
advantages over standard occulting bodies. IRIS blocks up to 99.97% of the
visible light from the occulted point source. Because the occultation occurs
outside both the telescope and the atmosphere, seeing and telescope
imperfections do not degrade this performance. If placed in Earth orbit,
integration times of 250-2500 \second can be achieved over 95% of the sky, from
most major telescope sites. Alternatively, combining IRIS with a basic 2-m (or
4-m) space telescope at the Earth-Sun L2 point could yield longer integration
times and simplified orbital dynamics. Applications for IRIS include searching
for planets around nearby stars, resolution of micro-lensed LMC and Galactic
bulge stars into distinct image pairs, and detailed mapping of solar system
planets from the ground. Using ground-based K-band observations, a Jovian
planet with a surface temperature of 400 \kelvin or Venus at 700 \kelvin could
be imaged at all angular separations greater than about $0.35\as$ out to over
$10\parsec$. Space based observations in the K-band (in emission) or B-band (in
reflection) could do better. Resolution of microlensed stars would greatly
improve our understanding of the Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs)

standard models for its dynamical and chemical evolution. In these models, the
stellar birthrate history is determined by the infall rate of primordial gas,
and by its functional dependence on the mass surface density of the stars and
gas. We adopt a two component model for the Galaxy, consisting of a central
bulge and an exponential disk with different infall rates and stellar birthrate
histories. Condensation in stellar winds, Type Ia and Type II supernovae, and
the accretion of refractory elements onto preexisting grains in dense molecular
clouds are the dominant contributors to the abundance of elements locked up in
the dust. Grain destruction by sputtering and evaporative grain-grain
collisions in supernova remnants are the most important mechanisms that return
these elements back to the gas phase.
  We calculate the dust production rate by the various dust sources, analyze
the origin of the elemental depletion pattern, and study the relation between
dust abundance and ISM metallicity, and the evolution of the the dust abundance
and composition at each Galactocentric radius as a function of time.
  The derived relation of dust mass with metallicity is compared to the
observed Galactic dust abundance gradient, and to the M$_{dust}$ versus
log(O/H) relation that is observed in external Dwarf galaxies.
  The dependence of dust composition on the mass of the progenitor star, and
the delayed recycling of newly synthesized dust by low mass stars back to the

invariance and its associated complex exponents may appear ``spontaneously'' in
euclidean systems, i.e. without the need for a pre-existing hierarchy. Examples
are diffusion-limited-aggregation clusters, rupture in heterogeneous systems,
earthquakes, animals (a generalization of percolation) among many other

discrete scale invariance and provide an extensive list of situations where
complex exponents have been found. This is done in order to provide a basis for

$T_d$ is required to have a finite value of $T_c$ and that not all carriers
participate in pairings, yielding multiconnected superconductors (MS). A new
density of states, derived by keeping the order parameter zero outside of
$T_d$, is shown to account for the observed low energy states in HTS and for
the temperature dependences in the specific heat, the penetration depth, the
optical conductivity, and the tunneling conductance data. I argue that the
notion of MS can account for the tunneling data along the a(or b)-, ab-, and
c-axis, and the 1/2 flux quantum observed in HTS. The region occupied by
unpaired carriers can be considered as a vortex with a fluxoid quantum number
equal to 1 (VF), 0 (VZF), or -1 (VAF) when the magnetic flux around the vortex
is greater than, equal to, or less than the effective flux produced by the
supercurrent, respectively. The Hall anomaly depends on the relative strengths

that not a single vortex/antivortex is produced via the Kibble mechanism, while
the new mechanism leads to production of 104 vortices and antivortices. Even
without biasing the phase distribution inside bubbles, the vortex production is
completely dominated by this new mechanism, which accounts for the production
of about 80% of the vortices and antivortices, remaining 20% being produced via
the Kibble mechanism. We study the dependence of the effectiveness of the new

polynomial in the fields facilitating the quantization process. It is argued,
rigorously, that if one wishes to construct polynomial actions without
curvature terms and where supersymmetry is linearly realized, after the
elimination of auxiliary fields, one must relinquish S supersymmetry and
concentrate solely on the Q-supersymmetry associated with the superconformal
