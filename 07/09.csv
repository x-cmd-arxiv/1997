of the 3CR galaxies results from a difference in the size of the host galaxies,

size-luminosity relation of the $z\sim 1.1$ 6C galaxies indicates a 1.0--1.8
mag enhancement of the rest-frame R-band surface brightness relative to either
local ellipticals of the same size or FRII radio galaxies at $z<0.2$. The 3CR
galaxies at $z\sim 1.1$ show a comparable enhancement in surface brightness.
The mean radius of the 6C galaxies suggests that they evolve into ellipticals
of $L\sim L^*$ luminosity, and is consistent with their low redshift
counterparts being relatively small FRII galaxies, a factor $\sim 25$ lower in
radio luminosity, or small FRI galaxies a factor of $\sim 1000$ lower in radio

collection of interwoven fractal subsets which exhibit power-law spatial
scaling behavior with a range of scaling exponents (concentration, or

underlying multiplicative (or hierarchical, or cascade) process. Panoramic
column density images of several nearby star- forming cloud complexes,
constructed from IRAS data and justified in an appendix, are shown to exhibit
such multifractal scaling, which we interpret as indirect but quantitative
evidence for nested hierarchical structure. The relation between the dimensions
of the subsets and their concentration strengths (the ""multifractal spectrum'')
appears to satisfactorily order the observed regions in terms of the mixture of
geometries present: strong point-like concentrations, line- like filaments or
fronts, and space-filling diffuse structures. This multifractal spectrum is a
global property of the regions studied, and does not rely on any operational
definition of ""clouds.'' The range of forms of the multifractal spectrum among
the regions studied implies that the column density structures do not form a
universality class, in contrast to indications for velocity and passive scalar
fields in incompressible turbulence, providing another indication that the
physics of highly compressible interstellar gas dynamics differs fundamentally
from incompressible turbulence. (Abstract truncated)

spectrum and a 20% decrease in the 1-20 keV X-ray flux accompany the 1990
transition from steady spin up to steady spin down in 4U 1626-67. The Ginga ASM
is the only instrument to observe 4U 1626-67 during both spin up and spin down.
We show that the distance to 4U 1626-67 is greater than 5 kpc. If 4U 1626-67 is
a near-equilibrium rotator and if the 0.04 Hz Quasi-Period Oscillations seen
during spin up are magnetospheric beat-frequency oscillations, then the
distance to the source is 5 kpc, assuming a neutron-star mass of 1.4 solar
masses, radius 10 km, and moment of inertia 10^45 g cm^2. The X-ray flux of GX
301-2 measured with the ASM varies with orbital phase. The flux peaks shortly
before periastron, with a secondary maximum near apastron. Such variations were
seen previously in the 20-50 keV pulsed flux with BATSE. The ASM observations
confirm that the 20-50 keV pulsed flux in GX 301-2 is a good tracer of the
bolometric flux. The X-ray flux in GX 301-2 was a factor of 2 larger than
average during the periastron passage prior to an episode of persistent spin up

both be measured reliably from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey. The real-space
correlation function is well fitted by the power law $\xi(r)=(r_0/r)^\gamma$
with $r_0=(5.06\pm0.12)\mpc$ and $\gamma=1.862\pm 0.034$, and the pairwise
velocity dispersion at $1\mpc$ is $(570\pm 80)\kms$. A detailed comparison
between these observational results and the predictions of current CDM
cosmogonies is carried out. We construct 60 mock samples for each theoretical
model from a large set of high resolution N-body simulations, which allows us
to include various observational selection effects in the analyses and to use
exactly the same methods for both real and theoretical samples. We demonstrate
that such a procedure is essential in the comparison between models and
observations. The observed two-point correlation function is significantly
flatter than the mass correlation function in current CDM models on scales $\la
1\mpc$. The observed pairwise velocity dispersion is also lower than that of
dark matter particles in these models. We propose a simple antibias model to
explain these discrepancies. This model assumes that the number of galaxies per
unit dark matter mass, $N/M$, decreases with the mass of dark haloes. The
predictions of CDM models with $\sigma_8\Omega_0^{0.6}\sim 0.4$-0.5 and
$\Omega_0 h\sim 0.2$ are in agreement with the observational results, if the
trend of $N/M$ with $M$ is at the level already observed for rich clusters of
galaxies. Thus CDM models with cluster-abundance normalization are consistent
with the observed correlation function and pairwise velocity dispersion of
galaxies. A high level of velocity bias is not required in these models.

follow-up observations of all signals have been used to obtain better

of the achieved survey sensitivity. The resulting HIMF has a shallow faint end
slope (alpha ~ 1.2), and is consistent with earlier estimates computed for the
population of optically selected gas rich galaxies. This implies that there is
not a large population of gas rich low luminosity or low surface brightness
galaxies that has gone unnoticed by optical surveys. The cosmological mass
density of HI at the present time determined from the survey, Omega_HI = (2.0

exponent for a one-dimensional lattice model of spinless fermions with nearest

Keeping up to 1200 states per block we achieve a very great accuracy for the
overlap which is needed to extract the orthogonality exponent reliably. We
discuss the behavior of the exponent for three different kinds of a localized
impurity. For comparison we also discuss the non-interacting case. In the weak
impurity limit our results for the overlap confirm scaling behavior expected
from perturbation theory and renormalization group calculations. In particular
we find that a weak backward scattering component of the orthogonality exponent
scales to zero for attractive interaction. In the strong impurity limit and for
repulsive interaction we demonstrate that the orthogonality exponent cannot be
extracted from the overlap for systems with up to 100 sites, due to finite size
effects. This is in contradiction to an earlier interpretation given by Qin et
al. based on numerical data for much smaller system sizes. Neverthless we find
indirect evidence that the backward scattering contribution to the exponent
scales to 1/16 based on predictions of boundary conformal field theory.

we demonstrate that algorithmic improvements like fast Krylov solvers and
parallel preconditioning recently introduced can be put into practise in full
QCD simulations, we present encouraging observations as to the critical
dynamics of the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in the approach to the chiral

The case when nu_s do not thermalize till 2 MeV and the oscillations become
effective after nu_e decoupling is discussed. The evolution of neutrino
ensembles was described numerically by integrating the kinetic equations for
the neutrino density matrix in momentum space. We have provided a detail
numerical study of the influence of the nonequilibrium nu_e - nu_s oscillations
on the primordial production of He-4. The exact kinetic approach enabled us to
calculate the effects of neutrino population depletion, the distortion of the
neutrino energy spectrum and the generation of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry
on the kinetics of neutron-to-proton transitions during the primordial
nucleosynthesis epoch and correspondingly on the cosmological He-4 production.
  It was shown that the neutrino population depletion and spectrum distortion
play an important role. The asymmetry effect, in case the lepton asymmetry is
accepted initially equal to the baryon one, is proved to be negligible for the
discussed range of delta m^2. Constant helium contours in delta m^2 - theta
plain were obtained for small mass differences delta m^2 < 10^{-7} eV^2. More
precise cosmological constraints on mixing parameters were obtained.

conditions of the MIT bag model are obtained. The calculations are done with
the fields occupying the regions inside and outside the bag, separately. The
renormalization procedure for each of the situations is studied in detail, in
particular the differences occurring with respect to the case when the field
extends over the whole space. The final result contains several constants
undergoing renormalization, which can be determined only experimentally. The
non-trivial finite parts which appear in the massive case are found exactly,
providing a precise determination of the complete, renormalized zero-point
energy for the first time, in the fermionic case. The vacuum energy behaves
like inverse powers of the mass for large masses.

dynamics simulations has long become a textbook subject and seems to have been
studied exhaustively. There are, however, a few striking effects in performance
of algorithms which are well-known but have not received adequate attention in
the literature. A closer view of these unclear observations results in
unexpected conclusions. It is shown here that contrary to the conventional
point of view, the leapfrog scheme is distinguished in this group both in terms
of the order of truncation errors and the conservation of the total energy. In
this case the characteristic square growth of fluctuations of the total energy
with the step size, commonly measured in numerical tests, results from
additional interpolation errors with no relation to the accuracy of the
computed trajectory. An alternative procedure is described for checking energy
conservation of leapfrog-like algorithms which is free from interpolation
errors. Preliminary tests on a representative model system suggest that
standard step size values used at present are lower than necessary for accurate
sampling.

Lie groups, which can be split or decay into two subsystems of the same

splitting are the generalized coherent states. Since Bell's inequality is never
violated by the direct product state, when the system prepared in the
generalized coherent state is split, no quantum correlations are created.
Therefore, the generalized coherent states are the unique Bell states, i.e.,
the pure quantum states preserving the fundamental classical property of
satisfying Bell's inequality upon splitting.

rapidity or quasi-momentum in the integrable system should be regarded as a
modification of velocity rather than that of momentum. I have also considered
the three-body wave function and argued its integrable condition.
