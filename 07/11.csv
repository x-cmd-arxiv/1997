  The EROS and MACHO observations of classical Cepheids in the Large and Small

analytic distribution function for the ``fast'' dynamical variables and a
simplified Fokker-Planck equation for the ``slow'' variables which can be
solved straightforwardly using various techniques. These solutions are accurate
to order epsilon, where epsilon is the ratio of the fast and slow dynamical
timescales. As a simple illustration of the method, I derive an analytic
solution for the joint distribution established when Barnett relaxation acts in
concert with gas damping. The statistics of the analytic solution agree with
the results of laborious numerical calculations which do not exploit the
adiabatic approximation.

parameters of either $r_{0}\sim4~h^{-1}~Mpc$ and $\epsilon\sim0-1$;

the basic cosmological model with standard sources, which postulates that
difference between bright and dim bursts results from different cosmological
red-shifts of their sources. The average emissivity curve (ACEbright) of the
group of bright BATSE bursts is approximated by a simple analytical function,
which takes into account the effect of squeezing of the time pulses with
increasing energy of photons. This function is used to build the model light
curve for ACEdim of dim BATSE bursts, which takes into account both the
cosmological time- stretching of bursts light curves and the red-shifting of
photons energies. Direct comparison between the model light curve and the
ACEdim of dim bursts is performed, which is based on the estimated
probabilities of differences between ACEs of randomly selected groups of
bursts. It shows no evidence for the predicted cosmological effects. The 3
sigma upper limit of the average red- shift Zdim of emitters of dim bursts is
estimated to be as small, as 0.1-0.5, which is not consistent with values 1

exchange to the frictional drag between nearby two-dimensional electron
systems. In the case of free phonons, we find a divergent drag rate
($\tau_{D}^{-1}$). However, $\tau_{D}^{-1}$ becomes finite when phonon
scattering from either lattice imperfections or electronic excitations is
accounted for. In the case of GaAs quantum wells, we find that for a phonon
mean free path $\ell_{ph}$ smaller than a critical value, imperfection
scattering dominates and the drag rate varies as $ln (\ell_{ph}/d)$ over many
orders of magnitude of the layer separation $d$. When $\ell_{ph}$ exceeds the
critical value, the drag rate is dominated by coupling through an
electron-phonon collective mode localized in the vicinity of the electron
layers. We argue that the coupled electron-phonon mode may be observable for
realistic parameters. Our theory is in good agreement with experimental results
for the temperature, density, and $d$-dependence of the drag rate.

is integrable and separable in spherical coordinates. In anisotropic traps the
classical dynamics is found, in general, to be nonintegrable. For
quasi-particle energies E much smaller than thechemical potential, besides the
conserved quasi-particle energy, we identify two additional nearly conserved
phase-space functions. These render the dynamics inside the condensate
(collective dynamics) integrable asymptotically for E/chemical potential very
small. However, there coexists at the same energy a dynamics confined to the
surface of the condensate, which is governed by a classical Hartree-Fock
Hamiltonian. We find that also this dynamics becomes integrable for E/chemical
potential very small, because of the appearance of an adiabatic invariant. For
E/chemical potential of order 1 a large portion of the phase-space supports
chaotic motion, both, for the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian and its Hartree-Fock
approximant. To exemplify this we exhibit Poincar\'e surface of sections for
harmonic traps with the cylindrical symmetry and anisotropy found in TOP traps.
For E/chemical potential very large the dynamics is again governed by the
Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian. In the case with cylindrical symmetry it becomes
quasi-integrable because the remaining small chaotic components in phase space
are tightly confined by tori.

q-bar-q mesons. However, they can also have exotic quantum numbers inaccessible

Consistent velocity power counting in dimensional regularization is achieved by
including two distinct gluon fields, one corresponding to gluon radiation and
one corresponding to an instantaneous potential. In this scheme power counting
is manifest in any gauge, and also holds for non-gauge interactions. The
matching conditions for an external vector current in NRQCD are calculated to
O(g^2 v^2) and the cancellation of infrared divergences in the matching

formulate the corresponding M(atrix) gauge theory, which lives on a dual

be introduced to cancel gauge anomalies. In the absence of an $E_8 \times E_8$

incorporates the massive IIA supergravity background into M(atrix) theory by
explicitly breaking (2+1)-dimensional Poincare invariance. The BPS excitations

effect is due to the non-unitary evolution of the pre- and post-scattering

identification of a single spatial region at one time with the same region at

experiment is shown to deviate from the standard value (the value predicted if
no CTCs existed). It is shown that if the time machines are small, sparsely

negligible as compared to the experimental error of even the most accurate
measurements of cross-sections. For a spacetime with CTCs at all points, or one

associated respectively to the gauge symmetry and to the BRST symmetry. Then,
we show that ($\hat\Gamma,\hat\zeta,\Gamma$), where $\hat\zeta$ is the group of
BRST transformations, is endowed with the structure of a principle fiber bundle
over the base manifold $\Gamma$. Furthermore, in this geometrical set up due to
the nilpotency of the BRST operator, we prove that the effective action of a
gauge theory is a BRST-exact term up to the classical action. Then, we conclude
that the effective action where only the gauge symmetry is fixed, is
cohomologically equivalent to the action where the gauge and the BRST
symmetries are fixed.
