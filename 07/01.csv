densities of damped Lyman-alpha systems at high redshift to investigate the
distribution of baryons in protogalaxies within the context of a standard cold
dark matter model. We proceed under the assumption that damped Lyman alpha
systems represent a population of cold, rotationally supported, protogalactic
disks and that the abundance of protogalactic halos is well approximated by a
cold dark matter model with critical density and vanishing cosmological
constant. Using conditional cross sections to observe a damped system with a
given velocity width and column density, we compare observationally inferred
velocity width and column density distributions to the corresponding
theoretically determined distributions for a variety of disk parameters and CDM
normalizations. In general, we find that the observations can not be reproduced
by the models for most disk parameters and CDM normalizations. Whereas the
column density distribution favors small disks with large neutral gas fraction,
the velocity width distribution favors large and thick disks with small neutral
gas fraction. The possible resolutions of this problem in the context of this
CDM model may be: (1) an increased contribution of rapidly rotating disks
within massive dark matter halos to damped Lyman-alpha absorption or (2) the
abandoning of simple disk models within this CDM model for damped Lyman-alpha
systems at high redshift. Here the first possibility may be achieved by
supposing that damped Lya system formation only occurs in halos with fairly
large circular velocities and the second possibility may result from a large
contribution of mergers and double-disks to damped Lya absorption at high
redshift.

multi-wavelength observations of NGC 3227, the dusty warm absorber is favored
and suggested as an explanation for the lack of a large cold absorbing column

Self-consistent re-calculation of the models including Galactic-ISM-like dust
results in an ionization parameter log U = -0.25 and a column density log N_w =

considered include, the ferromagnetic transition, the antiferromagnetic
transition, the superconductor-metal transition, and various metal-insulator
transitions. Emphasis is placed on how to determine the universal properties
that characterize these quantum phase transitions. For the first three of the
phase transitions listed above, one of the main physical ideas established is
that in zero-temperature systems there are soft or slow modes that exist in
addition to the soft order parameter fluctuations, and that these modes can
couple to the critical modes. These extra soft modes are shown to have a
profound effect on the quantum critical properties. For quantum phase
transitions involving zero wavenumber order parameters, i.e., the ferromagnetic
and superconductor-metal transitions, these extra modes effectively lead to
long-ranged effective interactions between order parameter fluctuations, which
in turn lead to exactly soluble critical behaviors. For the antiferromagnetic
case, we argue that while in low enough dimensions disorder fluctuation effects
tend to destroy long-range order, quantum fluctuations counteract this effect
and in some parameter regions manage to re-establish antiferromagnetic
long-range order. For the metal-insulator transition, some recent new ideas are
reviewed. In particular, it is pointed out that for interacting disordered
electrons, one expects that in high dimensions the metal-insulator transition
is related to the phase transition that occurs in random-field magnets in high
dimensions. If the analogy also holds in three dimensions this suggests that
the metal-insulator transition might have glassy characteristics.

one-matrix model, and the two-matrix model, although it seems that the methods

models such as the chain of matrices, or the O(n) model. We recover the
universality of the two point function in two regimes: short distance regime
when the two eigenvalues are separated by a small number of other eigenvalues,
and on the other hand the long range regime, when the two eigenvalues are far
away in the spectrum, in this regime we have to smooth the short scale
oscillations. We also discuss the universality properties of more than two
eigenvalues correlation functions.

to explain the solar neutrino deficit, we may have large CP-violation effect.
When we attribute both the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino
deficit to neutrino oscillation, we can see sizable T-violation effects. In
this case, however, we cannot ignore the matter effect and we will not see the
pure CP-violation effect. We also show simple methods how to separate pure CP
violating effect from the matter effect. We give compact formulae for neutrino
oscillation probabilities assuming one of the three neutrino masses (presumably
tau neutrino mass) to be much larger than the other masses and the effective
mass due to matter effect. Two methods are shown: One is to observe envelopes
of the curves of oscillation probabilities as functions of neutrino energy; a
merit of this method is that only a single detector is enough to determine the
presence of CP violation. The other is to compare experiments with at least two

birational to the original Calabi-Yau fourfold, but is not necessarily a

be predicted by supersymmetry from the mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons

anomaly in four-dimensional N=2 theories. We find a new contribution to the
Einstein term in five dimensions proportional to the Euler number of the
internal CY threefold, which corresponds to a one-loop correction of the
hypermultiplet geometry. This correction is reproduced by a direct computation
in type II string theories. Finally, we discuss a universal non-perturbative
correction to the type IIB hyper-metric.

find a statement about duality in ten dimensions by decompactifying the

The resultant K3 surface may be analyzed in two quite different ways - one of
which is natural from the point of view of differential geometry and the other
from the point of view of algebraic geometry. We see how the former leads to a
""squashed K3 surface"" and reproduces the Horava-Witten picture of the heterotic
string in M-theory. The latter produces a ""stable degeneration"" and is tied
more closely to F-theory. We use the relationship between these degenerations
to obtain the M-theory picture of a point-like E8-instanton directly from the
F-theory picture of the same object.

be correctly described by this model. If this turns out to be true then several
results concerning e.g., critical temperatures, symmetry restoration at high
temperature and high temperature expansions should be reconsidered. We
illustrate our conjecture by using the Nambu-Goto string model. We compare a
two-loop calculation of the free energy or quark-antiquark static potential at
finite temperature with a previous exact calculation in the large-d limit and
show how the perturbative expansion fails to reproduce important features in
the neighborhood of the critical temperature. It becomes clear why this happens
in the Nambu-Goto model and we suggest that perhaps something similar occurs
with the $\phi^4$ model.

"math/9707214",,"Jean Taylor","Motion by weighted mean curvature is affine invariant",,,,"MSRI 1997-072","math.DG",,"  Suppose curves are moving by curvature in a plane, but one embeds the plane
in $R^3$ and looks at the plane from an angle. Then circles shrinking to a
round point would appear to be ellipses shrinking to an ``elliptical point,''
and the surface energy would appear to be anisotropic as would the mobility.
The result of this paper is that if one uses the apparent surface energy and
the apparent mobility, then the motion by weighted curvature with mobility in
the apparent plane is the same as motion by curvature in the original plane but
then viewed from the angle. This result applies not only to the isotropic case
but to arbitrary surface energy functions and mobilities in the plane, to
surfaces in 3-space, and (in the case that the surface energy function is twice
differentiable) to the case of motion viewed through distorted lenses (i.e.,
diffeomorphisms) as well. This result is to be contrasted with an earlier
result which states that for area-preserving affine transformations of the
plane where the energy and mobility are NOT also transformed, motion by
curvature to the power 1/3 (rather than 1) is invariant.
