produces surprising sampling effects on the estimation of the CMB power
spectrum. Estimates of the average power spectrum based on small sky patches
produce qualitatively different results from patch to patch, and vary also with
the patch size. For instance a system of secondary Doppler peaks is observed in
small enough patches, but at different positions in different patches. However,
no secondary Doppler peaks are observed in large sky patches. These effects
question usual methods of power spectrum estimation, and techniques like
bootstrapping. The non-Gaussianity of this model fails to be detected by
standard tests.

MgII absorbers. Kinematic models are presented that show this population to be
consistent with some combination of halo and disk kinematics and not with a
pure disk or halo model. In contrast, the 2 < z < 3 CIV absorbers are likely to
represent a mix of already formed halos and protogalactic clumps in the process
of assembly. Clues could be provided by the level at which SiIV traces the same
kinematic components as CIV (relative to how it traces lower ionization gas)
and this is illustrated by a simple application of principal components
analysis. It remains uncertain how much unambiguous information it will be
possible to extract about the detailed properties of the gas along the line of
sight through an individual absorption profile. However, ratios of various low
and high ionization transitions along the line of sight can be combined with
insights gained from kinematic models and from observations of galaxy

therefore appear to be the best local analogs to the highest redshift galaxies

because the high-z observations are sensitive to the rest-frame UV emission,
which is dominated by the most active star forming regions. The extended

We conclude that imaging observations in the restframe UV alone cannot reveal
whether high-z systems (z>1.5) are proto-galaxies, proto-bulges, or starbursts

turbulent dynamo. However the same turbulence also leads to a small-scale
dynamo which generates magnetic noise at a more rapid rate. The efficiency of
the large-scale dynamo depends on how this noise saturates. We examine this
issue taking into account ambipolar drift, which obtains in a galaxy with
significant neutral gas. We argue that, (1) the small-scale dynamo generated
field does not fill the volume, but is concentrated into intermittent rope like
structures. The flux ropes are curved on the turbulent eddy scales. Their
thickness is set by the diffusive scale determined by the effective ambipolar
diffusion; (2) For a largely neutral galactic gas, the small-scale dynamo
saturates, due to inefficient random stretching, when the peak field in a flux
rope has grown to a few times the equipartition value; (3) The average energy
density in the saturated small-scale field is sub equipartition, since it does
not fill the volume; (4) Such fields neither drain significant energy from the
turbulence nor convert eddy motion of the turbulence on the outer scale into
wavelike motion. The diffusive effects needed for the large-scale dynamo
operation are then preserved until the large-scale field itself grows to near
equipartition levels.

some spins are replaced by spinless vacancies, such as it occurs by $Zn$
doping. A small percentage of vacancies rapidly destroys the spin gap, and
their presence induces enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations near those
vacancies. The study is performed with computational techniques which includes
Lanczos, world-line Monte Carlo, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group
methods. Since the phenomenon of enhanced antiferromagnetism is found to occur
in several models and cluster geometries, a common simple explanation for its
presence may exist. It is argued that the resonating-valence-bond character of
the spin correlations at short distances of a large variety of models is
responsible for the presence of robust staggered spin correlations near
vacancies and lattice edges. The phenomenon takes place regardless of the long
distance properties of the ground state, and it is caused by a ``pruning'' of
the available spin singlets in the vicinity of the vacancies. The effect
produces a broadening of the low temperature NMR signal for the compounds

a late stage dynamics sets in, described by scaling laws and exponents

theorem that I call the spin-locality theorem. I also argue that the
spin-statistics theorem properly depends on the properties of asymptotic fields
which are free fields. In addition, I discuss how ghosts evade both theorems,
give the basis of the spin-statistics theorem for fields without asymptotic
limits such as quark and gluon fields, and emphasise the weakness of the
requirements for the $TCP$ theorem.

40% to the total capture rate (45 SNU) assuming the fluxes predicted by the
Standard Solar Model.

with zero surface tension, which contains the physical fixed points of the
regularized (non-zero surface tension) problem. New fixed points are found and
the basin of attraction of the Saffman-Taylor finger is determined within that
class. Specific features of the physics of finger competition are identified
and quantitatively defined, which are absent in the zero surface tension case.
This has dramatic consequences for the long-time asymptotics, revealing a
fundamental role of surface tension in the dynamics of the problem. A
multifinger extension of microscopic solvability theory is proposed to
elucidate the interplay between finger widths, screening and surface tension.

  reine angew. Math. (Crelle's Journal)",,,,"q-alg math.QA",,"  For transcendental values of $q$ all bicovariant first order differential
calculi on the coordinate Hopf algebras of the quantum groups $SL_q(n+1)$ and
$Sp_q(2n)$ are classified. It is shown that the irreducible bicovariant first
order calculi are determined by an irreducible corepresentation of the quantum
group and a complex number $\zeta$ such that $\zeta^{n+1}=1$ for $SL_q(n+1)$
and $\zeta^2=1$ for $Sp_q(2n)$. Any bicovariant calculus is inner and its
quantum Lie algebra is generated by a central element. The main technical
ingredient is a result of the Hopf algebra $R(G_q)^0$ for arbitrary simple Lie
algebras.

encoded in a system which is continuously subject to the operations required to
implement a quantum error correcting code. In the limit of continuous error
correction we introduce a Markovian master equation that includes the effects
of: a) Hamiltonian evolution, b) errors caused by the interaction with an
environment and c) error-correcting operations. The master equation is formally
presented for all stabilizer codes and its solution is analyzed for the
simplest such code.
