contributor to the rest-frame UV emission in z~1 radio galaxies, is unlikely to
be a major component of the UV flux from 4C41.17. The spectrum shows absorption
lines that are similar to those detected in the spectra of the recently
discovered population of star forming galaxies at z~2-3. A galaxian outflow may
contribute partially to the low ionization absorption lines; however, the high
velocity wings of the high ionization lines are unlikely to be dominated by a
galaxian wind since the implied outflow mass is very large. The detection of
stellar absorption lines, the shape of the SiIV profile, the unpolarized
continuum, the inability of any AGN-related processes to account for the UV
flux, and the similarity of the UV continuum spectra of 4C41.17 and the nearby
starburst region NGC 1741B1 suggest that the UV light in 4C41.17 is dominated
by young stars. If so, the implied star-formation rate is roughly
140-1100Msun/yr. We discuss the possibility that star formation in 4C41.17 was
triggered by the radio source. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that
4C41.17 is undergoing its major epoch of star formation at z~4, and that by z~1
it will have evolved to have spectral and morphological properties similar to

charged particles while moving along the curved magnetic field lines in a
pulsar manetosphere. We propose that the radiation emitted by positrons and
electrons while moving along the curved magnetic field lines is orthogonally
polarized. The polarization angle of each orthogonal polarization mode is well
described by the rotating vector model. However, the polarization angle swings
observed in micropulses and subpulses are often found to be contrary to the
rotating vector model, and such swings are expected to arise due to the
coherent superposition of orthogonal polarization modes.
  As an application of our model, we discuss the polarization of pulsar PSR
B0950+08 at the frequency 1.71 GHz. Data on individual pulses, obtained using
the 100-m Effelsberg radiotelescope, was statistically analysed. We find that
pulsars emit radiation mainly in the form of two independent orthogonal modes.
It seems, they exist at all pulse longitudes but at some longitudes one mode
dominates over the other. The polarization angle gray-plot indicates two most
favoured angles separated by approximately 90 degree at each pulse longitude.
The depolarization is mainly caused by the incoherent superposition of
orthogonal modes.
  We infer from this study that pulsar radiation consists of two major
elliptically polarized electromagnetic waves with orthogonal polarization
angles. Our model predicts that such waves could be radiated by the positrons
and the electrons accelerated along the curved magnetic field lines. The sense
of circular polarization of these modes depend upon from which side of particle
trajectory the radiation is received.

high redshift QSO discovered so far. We show that the HeII opacity as a

Combination with high-resolution optical spectra of the Ly_alpha forest using
CASPEC at the ESO 3.6m telescope shows that the voids can be explained either
exclusively by Ly_alpha forest cloud absorption with a moderate N(HeII)/N(HI)
ratio of 100 and turbulent line broadening or by a combination of Ly_alpha
forest with N(HeII)/N(HI)=45 and thermal broadening plus a diffuse medium with
tau_GP_HeII=0.3. Thus a strict upper limit to a diffuse medium is Omega_diff<=
0.02 h_50^(-1.5) at z=2.8. In the troughs an additional continuous HeII 304 A
opacity tau > 2.8 is required. In case of photoionization, the troughs would
require a diffuse component with a density close to Omega = 0.059 h_50^(-1.5),
i.e. all baryons in the universe, which is inconsistent with the observed
absence of such a component in the voids. A tentative interpretation is that we
observe the epoch of partial HeII reionization of the universe with patches not

spherical shock waves propagating through the IGM. We then calculate the

(from Press-Schechter formalism), cooling physics, star-formation efficiencies,
gas ejection dynamics, and nucleosynthesis yields. We compare this expected

using realistic models of the lens matter distribution and a well-constrained

largest for lenses located in the Galactic disk. However, lens blending does
not seriously affect both the determination of the optical depth and the

the gas starts cooling slowly after recombination until the lowest stable

Below this redshift the formation of molecular hydrogen promotes a rapid
transition towards the cold \HI phase. We find that disks of protogalaxies with

approximation and a dispersion model in which the non-linear velocities
generated by the formation of virialized groups and clusters are treated as
random perturbations to the velocities predicted by linear theory. We find that
neither provides an adequate physical description of the clustering pattern. If

the estimated value of \beta (\beta=f(\Omega_0)/b where f(\Omega_0) ~
\Omega_0^{0.6} and b is the galaxy bias parameter) is liable to systematic
errors of order ten per cent or more. We discuss how such systematics can be
avoided by i) development of a more complete model of redshift distortions and
ii) the direct use of galaxy catalogues generated from non-linear N-body
simulations.

understood with `simple' lens models which contain a handful of parameters.
Whereas for many lens systems such simple mass models yield a remarkably good
description of the observed properties, there are some systems which are
notoriously difficult to understand quantitatively. We argue that at least in
one case (B 1422+231) these difficulties are not due to a `wrong'
parametrization of the lens model, but that the discrepancy between observed
and model-predicted flux ratios are due to substructure in the lens. Similar to
microlensing for optical fluxes, such substructure can distort also the radio
flux ratios predicted by `simple' mass models, in particular for highly
magnified images, without appreciably changing image positions. Substructure
also does not change the time delay significantly and therefore has little
effect on the determination of the Hubble constant using time delays. We
quantify these statements with several simple scenarios for substructure, and
propose a strategy to model lens systems in which substructure is suspected.

the 90-degree case on the single-period core reconstruction. In both cases, we
observe strongly reconstructed bonds at the dislocation cores, as suggested in
previous studies. As a consequence, relatively low formation energies and high
migration barriers are generally associated with reconstructed
(dangling-bond-free) kinks. Complexes formed of a kink plus a reconstruction
defect are found to be strongly bound in the 30-degree partial, while the
opposite is true in the case of 90-degree partial, where such complexes are
found to be only marginally stable at zero temperature with very low
dissociation barriers. For the 30-degree partial, our calculated formation
energies and migration barriers of kinks are seen to compare favorably with
experiment. Our results for the kink energies on the 90-degree partial are
consistent with a recently proposed alternative double-period structure for the
core of this dislocation.

translational invariance of the solitonic quark fields (which describe the

perform a Lorentz boost to the infinite momentum frame of the nucleon. The
major result is that the Lorentz contraction associated with this boost causes
the leading twist contribution to the structure functions to properly vanish

for structure functions calculated in the valence quark approximation to the

mode in the continuum LF theory by two examples: The Lorentz invariance forbids
even a free theory on the LF and the trivial LF vacuum is lost in the SSB
phase, both due to the zero mode as the accumulating point causing
uncontrollable infrared singularity. We then adopt the Discretized Light-Cone
Quantization (DLCQ) which was first introduced by Maskawa and Yamawaki to
establish the trivial LF vacuum and was re-discovered by Pauli and Brodsky in a
different context. It is shown in DLCQ that the SSB phase can be realized on
the trivial LF vacuum only when an explicit symmetry-breaking mass of the
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson m_pi is introduced as an infrared regulator. The
NG-boson zero mode integrated over the LF must exhibit singular behavior sim
1/m_{pi}^2 in the symmetric limit m_{pi} rightarrow 0 in such a way that the LF
charge is not conserved even in the symmetric limit; dot{Q} ne 0. There exists
no NG theorem on the LF. Instead, this singular behavior establishes existence
of the massless NG boson coupled to the current whose charge satisfies Q |0 >=0
and dot{Q} ne 0, in much the same as the NG theorem in the equal-time
quantization which ensures existence of the massless NG boson coupled to the
current whose charge satisfies Q|0 > ne 0 and dot{Q} = 0. We demonstrate such a
peculiarity in a concrete model, the linear sigma model, where the role of
zero-mode constraint is clarified.

valence quark model for the bound nucleons and hyperon. The model automatically
leads to a very weak spin-orbit interaction for the $\Lambda$ in a
hypernucleus. Effects of the Pauli blocking at the quark level, particularly in
the open, coupled, $\Sigma N - \Lambda N$ channel (strong conversion), is also
taken into account in a phenomenological way.

observables of NN elastic scattering below pion threshold. In this approach, we
use a nonlinear model of self-interacting mesons as a substitution for the
commonly used phenomenological form factors. NN data support an empirical
scaling law between the pion and other meson fields, which suggests a link to
QCD and significantly reduces the number of parameters in the boson exchange
potential. The analysis of np and pp observables distinguishes the model by its
fit and few adjustable parameters. An outlook to apply OSBEP in pi-N systems is
given.

into unstable states. While ``pushed'' fronts into meta- and unstable states
relax exponentially, pulled fronts relax algebraically, and simultaneously the
standard derivation of effective interface equations breaks down. We calculate
all universal relaxation terms of uniformly translating pulled fronts. The
leading $1/t$ and $1/t^{3/2}$ corrections to the velocity are determined by the
dispersion relation of the linearized equation only. Our analysis sheds new
light on the propagation mechanism of pulled fronts.
