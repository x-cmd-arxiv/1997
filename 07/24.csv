  http://www..dmi.ens.fr/users/beauvill/",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  A contact structure on a complex manifold M is a corank 1 subbundle F of T(M)
such that the bilinear form on F with values in the quotient line bundle
L=T(M)/F deduced from the Lie bracket of vector fields is everywhere
non-degenerate. In this paper we consider the case where M is a Fano manifold;
this implies that L is ample. If g is a simple Lie algebra, the unique closed
orbit in P(g) (for the adjoint action) is a Fano contact manifold; it is
conjectured that every Fano contact manifold is obtained in this way. A
positive answer would imply an analogous result for compact quaternion-Kahler
manifolds with positive scalar curvature, a longstanding question in Riemannian
geometry. In this paper we solve the conjecture under the additional
assumptions that the group of contact automorphisms of M is reductive, and that
the image of the rational map M - - -> P(H0(M,L)*) associated to L has maximum
dimension. The proof relies on the properties of the nilpotent orbits in a
semi-simple Lie algebra, in particular on the work of R. Brylinski and B.
Kostant.

+11.2deg, near the bulge of the Galaxy, may explain why it was not detected
before. The optical spectrum of PDS456 is typical of a luminous quasar, showing
a broad (FWHM ~ 4000 km/s) H_\beta line, very intense FeII lines and a weak
[OIII]\lambda5007 line. PDS456 is associated to the infrared source IRAS
17254-1413 with a 60 \mum infrared luminosity L_{60} = 3.8 x 10^{45} erg/s. The
relatively flat slopes in the infrared (\alpha(25,60) = -0.33 and \alpha(12,25)

of the emission lines in the optical and the X-ray luminosity, as well as the
steep optical to X-ray index estimated (\alpha_{ox} = -1.64) suggest that
PDS456 is radio quiet. A radio survey previously performed in this region
yields an upper limit for radio power at ~ 5 GHz of ~ 2.6 x 10^{30} erg/s/Hz.
We estimate the Galactic reddening in this line-of-sight to be A_B \simeq 2.0,
implying an absolute magnitude M_B = -26.7 (using H_0 = 75 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}

depleted in stars with extremely large [Al/Fe] (Shetrone 1996a). This and other
new spectroscopic results allow us to test current models of stellar evolution
and nucleosynthesis, as well as those of the formation and chemical enrichment
of globular clusters. In an effort to explain self-consistently these
observations we have considered two possibilities: (1) a deep mixing scenario
which assumes that in red giants some kind of (extra)mixing transports products
of nuclear reactions from the hydrogen burning shell (HBS) to the base of the
convective envelope; and (2) a combination of primordial and deep mixing
scenarios. It is shown that (1) cannot account for the anticorrelation of
[Mg/Fe] vs. [Al/Fe] without additional ad hoc assumptions, among which we
identify a strong but still undetected low energy resonance in the reaction
24Mg(p,gamma)25Al, and episodical increases of the HBS temperature up to the
value T approx. 74x10^6 K. In (2) intermediate mass AGB stars are assumed to
produce the decreased 24Mg and increased 25Mg initial abundances in some
globular-cluster low mass stars and Al is synthesized at the expense of 25Mg in
the HBS and transported to the surface of the red giant by extramixing. We
discuss advantages and deficiencies of both scenarios and propose some
observational tests.

cooling-flow and other cluster properties, such as baryon fractions, S-Z
microwave decrements, and Thomson depths. We have compiled a catalogue of the
detected cooling flows, and investigated their effects on general cluster
properties. Self-consistent correlations between the cluster X-ray luminosity,
temperature, and optical velocity-dispersion, are determined accounting for
errors in both dimensions of the data. These fits indicate that the
temperatures of clusters are isothermal and that they have spectral beta-values
consistent with unity.
  We find that the X-ray Lx, Tx, and optical Vopt relations depend
significantly on the cooling flow mass-deposition rate, through differences in
the density profiles. Clusters of similar mass-deposition rate exhibit
self-similar density profiles, with larger cooling flows showing higher central
densities. This leads to scatter in the Lx related correlations within the Lx,
Tx and Vopt plane. The segregation in density leads to dispersion in
`half-light radii' and baryon fractions. The baryon fraction in the cores of
cooling flow clusters appears to be higher, but all clusters appear to rise to
a concordant value of greater than 10 percent at 1 Mpc. Thus, clusters are
inconsistent with primordial nucleosynthesis baryon fraction, for a flat

massive star formation triggering in the spiral arms consistent with the spiral

related to, and probably caused, by the density-wave system. However, due to

recycling of the domain boundary inside the superlattice. For some biases, the
strengths of the low and high field domain change periodically in time with the
domain boundary being pinned within a few quantum wells. The dependency of the
frequency on the coupling leads to the prediction of a new type of tunable GHz
oscillator based on semiconductor superlattices.

superconducting films at zero-temperature are studied theoretically. The films
are assumed to be of thickness less than or equal to the penetration depth,
free of pinning by imperfections, and to be subjected to a magnetic field
parallel to the film surfaces and to a transport current perpendicular to the
field. By numerical minimization of the exact London theory energy expression,
using simulated annealing techniques, the equilibrium configurations are
determined with great accuracy over a wide range of fields and currents. These
consist of chains of straight vortex-lines whose number depends both on the
field and on the current. Transitions involving a change by one in the chain
number are found to take place either if the field is increased at zero
transport current or if the transport current is increased at constant field.
At the transitions, there is a considerable rearrangement in the vortex-line
positions and a small, discontinuous, change in their number. The equilibrium
configurations with chain numbers that are not too small form a nearly perfect
triangular lattice, centered with respect to the film surfaces. However, small
deviations from this arrangement are found to be important in determining the
behavior near the transition and when the transport current approaches the
critical current. It is found that the critical current has a a non-monotonic
dependence on the field. The zero-temperature equilibrium phase diagram in the
field-transport current plane is reported.

of the observed features such as the short planar coherence length. The stack
of Hubbard planes is arranged on a torus, which is threaded by a magnetic flux.
The current perpendicular to the planes is calculated as a function of applied
flux (i. e. the phase), and -- after careful elimination of finite-size effects
due to single-particle tunneling -- found to display a sinusoidal field
dependence in accordance with interlayer Josephson tunneling. Studies of the
temperature dependence of the supercurrent reveal at best a mild elevation of
the Josephson transition temperature compared to the planar Kosterlitz-Thouless
temperature. These and other results on the dependence of the model parameters

connected via a perturbative transition at the Landau-Ginzburg point.
Situations of this kind are studied for some explicit models. By calculating
the exact dimensions of the generic moduli spaces at large radius, strong
indications are found in favor of a different scenario. The two moduli spaces
are isomorphic and complex, K\""ahler and bundle moduli get exchanged.

proposal of Frohlich and Gawedzki, we describe the noncommutative string

of the string theory are a consequence of the existence of two independent
Dirac operators, arising from the chiral structure of the conformal field
theory. We demonstrate that these Dirac operators are also responsible for the
emergence of ordinary classical spacetime as a low-energy limit of the string
spacetime, and from this we establish a relationship between T-duality and
changes of spin structure of the target space manifold. We study the
automorphism group of the vertex operator algebra and show that spacetime
duality is naturally a gauge symmetry in this formalism. We show that classical
general covariance also becomes a gauge symmetry of the string spacetime. We
explore some larger symmetries of the algebra in the context of a universal
gauge group for string theory, and connect these symmetry groups with some of
the algebraic structures which arise in the mathematical theory of vertex
operator algebras, such as the Monster group. We also briefly describe how the
classical topology of spacetime is modified by the string theory, and calculate
the cohomology groups of the noncommutative spacetime. A self-contained,
pedagogical introduction to the techniques of noncommmutative geometry is also

the fact that BPS states correspond to the SUSY cycles with minimal volumes. We
show the mass formula derived in this manner is completely fitted with that

several kinds of R-R charges. These are cases of ``intersecting D-branes'',
which cannot be described by simple DBI actions. We claim that, in these cases,
higher loop corrections should be incorporated as binding energies between the
branes. It is remarkable that the summation of the contributions from all loops
