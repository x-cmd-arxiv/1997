most recently in Cepheids and RR Lyrae. We show that there is nothing strange
about these modes -- they must exist even in the adiabatic limit.
  With a change of variables and without approximation the adiabatic linear
pulsation equation is reduced to a Schroedinger equation in which the radial
coordinate is the local sound-traversal time. In this formulation, the narrow
hydrogen partial ionization region is seen to act as a potential barrier,
separating the star into two regions. Resonances between the two regions result
in the strange modes, for which the ratio of interior to exterior amplitude is
at a minimum. The relative location of the barrier changes with the stellar
parameters, and this gives rise to avoided level-crossings along a sequence of
models. 2 The appearance of strange modes and the associated level crossings
are exhibited with an analytic toy-model with the potential barrier
approximated by a delta function. This toy-model is readily extensible to
nonadiabatic modes.
  Hydrodynamical calculations find that pure strange mode limit-cycles have
extremely small photospheric velocities and luminosity variations in the
milli-magnitude range. They are therefore expected to be difficult to observe.

clustering models for structure formation. A rotationally supported disk with
exponential surface density profile is assumed to form with a mass and angular
momentum which are fixed fractions of those of its surrounding dark halo. We
assume that haloes respond adiabatically to disk formation, and that only
stable disks can correspond to real systems. With these assumptions the
predicted population can match both present-day disks and the damped Lyman
alpha absorbers in QSO spectra. Good agreement is found provided: (i) the
masses of disks are a few percent of those of their haloes; (ii) the specific
angular momenta of disks are similar to those of their haloes; (iii)
present-day disks were assembled recently (at z<1). In particular, the observed
scatter in the size-rotation velocity plane is reproduced, as is the slope and
scatter of the Tully-Fisher relation. The zero-point of the TF relation is
matched for a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 1 to 2 h in the I-band, consistent
with observational values derived from disk dynamics. High redshift disks are
predicted to be small and dense, and could plausibly merge together to form the
observed population of elliptical galaxies. In many (but not all) currently
popular cosmogonies, disks with rotation velocities exceeding 200 km/s can
account for a third or more of the observed damped Lyman alpha systems at
z=2.5. Half of the lines-of-sight to such systems are predicted to intersect
the absorber at r>3kpc/h and about 10% at r>10kpc/h. The cross-section for
absorption is strongly weighted towards disks with large angular momentum and
so large size for their mass. The galaxy population associated with damped
absorbers should thus be biased towards low surface brightness systems.

The rapid flares in the light curves bear resemblance to those observed for
Cygnus X-1, a well-known black hole candidate (BHC). The power-density spectrum
is also very typical of BHCs in the HARD (or LOW) state: it is flat below a
characteristic break frequency of ~0.03 Hz, and becomes roughly a 1/f power law
above. The observed X-ray spectrum can be characterized by a simple power law
with a photon index of ~1.7 over a broad energy range 2-200 keV, which is
remarkably similar to that of Cyg X-1 in the HARD state. The similarities to

model with Grassmann-valued fermion fields in the Higgs phase is given. We
bypass the complications of the Hamiltonian theory in the Higgs phase,
resulting from the spontaneous symmetry breaking with the Higgs mechanism, by
studying the Hamiltonian formulation of the Higgs phase for the gauge
equivalent Lagrangian in the unitary gauge. A canonical basis of Dirac's
observables is found and the reduced physical Hamiltonian is evaluated. Its
self-energy part is nonlocal for the electromagnetic and strong interactions,
but local for the weak ones. Therefore, the Fermi 4-fermion interaction
reappears at the nonperturbative level.

physically robust viewpoint in which the Casimir energy in dielectric media is
interpreted as the change in the total zero point energy of the electromagnetic
vacuum summed over all states. Extending results presented in previous papers
[hep-th/9609195; hep-th/9702007] we approximate the sum over states by an
integral over the density of states including finite volume corrections. For an
arbitrarily-shaped finite dielectric, the first finite-volume correction to the
density of states is shown to be proportional to the surface area of the
dielectric interface and is explicitly evaluated as a function of the
permeability and permitivity. Since these calculations are founded in an
elementary and straightforward way on the underlying physics of the Casimir
effect they serve as an important consistency check on field-theoretic
calculations. As a concrete example we discuss Schwinger's suggestion that the
Casimir effect might be the underlying physical basis behind sonoluminescence}.
The recent controversy concerning the relative importance of volume and surface
contributions is discussed. For sufficiently large bubbles the volume effect is
always dominant. Furthermore we can explicitly calculate the surface area
contribution as a function of refractive index.

discrete and continuous invariants used in the harmonic analysis, i.e. two
characteristic masses in the relativistic case. 'Canonical' field theories with
the familiar divergencies are inappropriate realizations of the real
4-dimensional causal manifold $\D(2)$. Faithful timespace realizations do not
lead to divergencies. In general they are reducible, but nondecomposable - in
addition to representations with eigenvectors (states, particle) they
incorporate principal vectors without a particle (eigenvector) basis as
exemplified by the Coulomb field.

transient state of nuclear matter with an appreciable isospin asymmetry as well
as thermal and compressional excitation can be created. This offers the
possibility to study the properties of nuclear matter in the region between
symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. In this review, we discuss
recent theoretical studies of the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric
nuclear matter and its relations to the properties of neutron stars and
radioactive nuclei. Chemical and mechanical instabilities as well as the
liquid-gas phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter are investigated. The
in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections at different isospin states are
reviewed as they affect significantly the dynamics of heavy ion collisions
induced by radioactive beams. We then discuss an isospin-dependent transport
model, which includes different mean-field potentials and cross sections for
the proton and neutron, and its application to these reactions. Furthermore, we
review the comparisons between theoretical predictions and available
experimental data. In particular, we discuss the study of nuclear stopping in
terms of isospin equilibration, the dependence of nuclear collective flow and
balance energy on the isospin-dependent nuclear equation of state and cross
sections, the isospin dependence of total nuclear reaction cross sections, and
the role of isospin in preequilibrium nucleon emissions and subthreshold pion
production.
