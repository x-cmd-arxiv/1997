  e.g., addition of references",,"10.1086/311178",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the starburst-driven outflow in the peculiar galaxy NGC 2782
forms a well-defined collimated bubble which has an extent of $\sim$ 1 kpc and
a closed shell at its edge, as seen in H$\alpha$, [O III], and 5 GHz radio
continuum. The shell coincides with the maximum in intensity and linewidths of
[O III] lines in a blueshifted emission nebula which was previously detected
via optical spectroscopy by Boer et al. (1992). Such a remarkable outflow
morphology has not been observed to date in any other starburst galaxy of
comparable luminosity. The radio continuum map reveals a second bubble of
similar size on the opposite side of the nucleus, forming a striking
double-bubble outflow morphology. We argue from the morphology and short
timescale ($\sim$ $4 \times 10^6$ years) of the outflow that it is dynamically
younger than freely-expanding outflows seen in other galaxies which harbor
circumnuclear starbursts of comparable luminosity, e.g., M82. We suggest that
the outflow in NGC 2782 is in the early stage where thermal instabilities have
not yet completely ruptured the outflow bubble.We present evidence that the
outflow is driving warm and hot ionised gas, and possibly cold molecular gas,
out of the central kpc of the galaxy. We estimate the contribution of the hot,
warm, and cold phases of the ISM to the energetics of the outflow. This study
is based on our optical BVR, H$\alpha$, and [O III] observations from the WIYN
telescope and OVRO CO interferometric data, along with available 5 GHz radio
continuum and ROSAT X-ray maps.

first and second sound in a uniform Bose gas. These results are shown to agree
with the predictions of the usual two-fluid equations of Landau when the
thermodynamic functions are evaluated for a weakly-interacting gas. In a
uniform gas, second sound mainly corresponds to an oscillation of the
superfluid (the condensate) and is the low frequency continuation of the
Goldstone-Bogoliubov symmetry-breaking mode.

extend our earlier work, Phys. Rev. 53, 8486 (1996), to finite temperatures and
to dynamical properties. Our results are consistent with the idea that there
are ``Griffiths-McCoy'' singularities in the paramagnetic phase described by a
continuously varying exponent $z(\delta)$, where $\delta$ measures the
deviation from criticality. There are some discrepancies between the values of
$z(\delta)$ obtained from different quantities, but this may be due to
corrections to scaling. The average on-site time dependent correlation function
decays with a power law in the paramagnetic phase, namely
$\tau^{-1/z(\delta)}$, where $\tau$ is imaginary time. However, the typical
value decays with a stretched exponential behavior, $\exp(-c\tau^{1/\mu})$,
where $\mu$ may be related to $z(\delta)$. We also obtain results for the full
probability distribution of time dependent correlation functions at different
points in the paramagnetic phase.

the 2D MIT in Si-based devices is caused by electron-electron interactions.

momentum range. In particular, the proton rapidity distribution scaled by the
beam rapidity is independent of the beam momentum, and this is in agreement
with the experimental findings. Also, a large volume of superdense hadronic
matter with a local energy density exceeding that expected for the transition
of a hadronic matter to the quark-gluon plasma is formed in collisions at beam
momenta greater than 8 GeV/c per nucleon. Furthermore, it is found that the
transverse flow in these collisions is sensitive to the nuclear equation of
state and decreases with increasing beam momentum. On the other hand, the
radial flow is insensitive to the equation of state, and its strength increases
with beam momentum.
