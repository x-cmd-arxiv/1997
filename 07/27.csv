gamma-ray emission. The HEGRA collaboration has studied Mkn 501 with their air
Cherenkov telescopes on La Palma. Here we report on observations with the 5 m^2
telescope (threshold approx. 1.5 TeV) operated in a stand alone mode. We
observed a rapidly varying flux between 0.5 to 6 times of that from the Crab
Nebula. On average an integral flux above 1.5 TeV of (2 + 1.3 - 0.5) x 10^-11
cm^-2 s^-1 has been determined. The spectrum extends at least up to 10 TeV with
an integral power law coefficient of 1.8 +- 0.2 and seems to be steeper than in
1996.

haloes directly from pure gravity N-body simulations is presented. This
combines the full non-linearity of N-body simulations with the flexibility of
the semi-analytical approach.
  Merging history trees derived from power-law initial perturbation spectrum
simulations (for indices $n=-2$ and $n=0$) by Warren et al. (1992) are shown.
As an example of a galaxy formation model, these are combined with evolutionary
stellar population synthesis, via simple scaling laws for star formation rates,
showing that if most star formation occurs during merger-induced bursts, then a
nearly flat faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function may be obtained
in certain cases.
  Interesting properties of hierarchical halo formation are noted: (1) In a
given model, merger rates may vary widely between individual haloes, and
typically 20%-30% of a halo's mass may be due to infall of uncollapsed
material. (2) Small mass haloes continue to form at recent times: as expected,
the existence of young, low redshift, low metallicity galaxies (e.g., Izotov et
al. 1997) is consistent with hierarchical galaxy formation models. (3) For
$n=-2,$ the halo spatial correlation function can have a very high initial bias
due to the high power on large scales.

in the expanding Universe, Zel'dovich approximation and its extensions in
Lagrangian scheme are known to be accurate even in mildly non-linear regime.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the reason why these Zel'dovich-type
approximations work accurately beyond the linear regime from the following two
points of view: (1) Dimensionality of the system and (2) the Lagrangian scheme
on which the Zel'dovich approximation is grounded. In order to examine the
dimensionality, we introduce a model with spheroidal mass distribution. In
order to examine the Lagrangian scheme, we introduce the Pad\'e approximation
in Eulerian scheme. We clarify which of these aspects supports the unusual
accuracy of the Zel'dovich-type approximations. We also give an implication for
more accurate approximation method beyond the Zel'dovich-type approximations.

cohesionless granular material under mechanical tapping. Using the compactivity
concept we develope a formalism of statistical mechanics which allows us to
calculate the density of a powder as a function of time and compactivity. A
simple fluctuation-dissipation relation which relates compactivity to the
amplitude and frequency of a tapping is proposed. Experimental data of
E.R.Nowak et al. [{\it Powder Technology} 94, 79 (1997) ] show how density of
initially deposited in a fluffy state powder evolves under carefully controlled
tapping towards a random close packing (RCP) density. Ramping the vibration
amplitude repeatedly up and back down again reveals the existence of reversible
and irreversible branches in the response. In the framework of our approach the
reversible branch (along which the RCP density is obtained) corresponds to the
steady state solution of the Fokker-Planck equation whereas the irreversible
one is represented by a superposition of ""excited states"" eigenfunctions. These
two regimes of response are analyzed theoretically and a qualitative
explanation of the hysteresis curve is offered.

explain through duality transformation the reason why static global vortex
